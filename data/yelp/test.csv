"Never again. Staff was rude from check in, to wait staff, to people renting the chairs on the beach. I am no sure what the resort fee actually covered because you have to pay every day for beach chairs and an umbrella. No where does it say that coolers are not allowed on the beach. The server Chris on the beach was extremely rude. When I asked him where it says no coolers he just snapped at my and says Ma'am I don't know that it is just hotel policy. The next day when I casually asked the front desk about it they said oh it's a food and beverage policy. So no one know what is going on. The food at the pool was over priced and small servings. The private beach has jet skis parked and boats pulling up to it constantly which honestly made swimming impossible. We were prepared for the loud music all night. But bring ear plugs because it can go until 5am.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 1.0

"After arriving in town and settling into my hotel I headed down the street to find the Split Rail Tavern. A local establishment that's been here a long time. Walking in I found my spot at the bar, and was quickly waited on by a very friendly bartender. After looking over the large selection of drinks I settled on a delicious locally made brew. For dinner I tried the New York strip special, with goat cheese mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts. The plate presentation as you can see in the photo is excellent and it tasted so good.

"This place is so very, very good! My husband had momo when he was at a convention (and generously tortured me with descriptions of how good they were), so when I found out about Rajdhani I had to try it!   I was not disappointed. Husband had the special combo, I had a non-veg thali.  Oh good lord it was good!  I had mutton curry, which was rich and faintly sweet, with a subtle heat. I do wish they'd de-bone the meat completely, but it was still tender and delicious. There was also a stir fried eggplant, and okra, and some slightly crisp, slightly bitter greens I couldn't identify but loved. A potato and cauliflower dish that wasn't aloo ghobi but something like it. Pappadum, and a puffed bread that enabled me to mop up the curry sauce. Oh and the yogurt? Yeah, not the nasty, starchy, might-as-well-call-it-pudding-and-be-done-with-it mess that is commercial American yogurt. Nice and sour.   Husband's special combo: chicken momo, chicken stir fried noodles, a huge potato and pea samosa, and soup. I tried it all and just WOW. The dumplings were tender and beautifully made, they did not fall apart when cut. Dipping sauce - not sure what it was but it was good. The noodles were amazing, well seasoned with carrot and onion and chunks of tandoori chicken (sorry I can't be more specific about the flavor; I'm new to Nepali food so I can only say it was delicious). The the soup I think might have been tomato based, a thin broth that was both delicate and sour.   After we shamelessly stuffed ourselves, we hit the market and came away with curry powder, chow mein masala, masala potato chips and yogurt. I already regret not getting the momo masala; I have plans to make momo meatballs with it, so we're going back next weekend.    Oh, and did I mention that everyone was super nice and patient with my ignorance of Nepali food, and willingly explained it to me?  Yeah that too.  Please, folks, please go to Rajdhani Groceries!

"We decided to go to Next Act on a Friday night because we wanted to go to Whyte to a bar that had a decent selection of beers - more than just the usual Molson/Rickards/Keiths or other mass market American beers.  There are a few other bars in the area that fit the bill - The Pourhouse (went their the week before) Wunderbar (there was a show so it would be loud) and Sugarbowl (probably would have had to wait a while for a table) but we heard the Next Act had a decent beer menu. They don't have as many beers as some of the other places I listed, but they do have a fair number. We tried a Mill Street lemon tea wheat beer, which was kind of a wheat beer with an iced tea flavour. I quite enjoyed it. I also had an Erdinger, which I drank a lot of in Germany and always enjoy.   We didn't have any food, so I can't comment on that. We've eaten there in the past but that was prior to their renovations and menu update, so it's not really applicable.   We started the night with four of us but two joined us later and unfortunately the booths are really small, so it was a very tight squeeze to get us all in there. All the booths are the same size but there are tables too. Unfortunately none were available for us, but we made do.   Service was pretty good too. Our server checked on us often, but not too often and recommended some beers as well.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Are you looking for a nice hotel in Philadelphia?  Well look no further.  This is your dream hotel.  YOUR DREAM HOTEL, I TELL YOU!  I have wanted to stay here for years, and back in the days when I lived in Philly I would often walk by and think ""what could I do to justify a stay here even though I live walking distance away?""  That moment arose when my husband and I came to town for a friend's wedding and their hotel room block was at the Hotel Monaco.  Sure, it was still expensive (a place this swanky comes with a price tag!) but I told my husband that we basically had no choice but to live it up for the night and book a room.  Carpe diem.  We walked in and it was glamour from the very first second.  Everything is just gorgeous and impeccably decorated.  The customer service is unbelievable.  All I could think was ""don't slip up, Jessica, pretend you're classy!""  We got to our room and holy cow.... who decorated?!  Don't get me wrong - I loved every square inch of it.  We found ""loud"" wallpaper, a pillow with an adorable quote, a perfectly propped up book of Alice and Wonderland, and the coolest bright red TV stand / media center that I have ever seen.  In the closet were robes (including a leopard print one) and a yoga mat (whattttt).  The bed was unbelievably comfortable and we had the most luxurious night's sleep.  And the bathtub came with bath salts so that you could really soak and relax (I didn't utilize this but it was tempting).  The ONLY thing that could have made our room better was if we had a cool view (some people I know had an incredible view of Independence Hall).  We had kind of a semi-view (ok, this is a stretch) of the Liberty Bell.  But this should tell you how great the location is - you are RIGHT in Old City.  You step outside and BOOM it's Independence Hall.  We had 45 minutes to kill and went on a guided tour of Congress Hall with no problem.  You can go to the Liberty Bell, the Betsy Ross House, the Constitution Center, or the American Jewish Museum (among about a million other cool places) without needing to hail a cab or set foot on a subway.    The two annoying things (well, one is actually kind of cool).  The first: parking was something like $43 a night.  I mean, I get it - you're in downtown Philly in the most touristy neighborhood in the whole city.  But no way, Jose.  Fortunately I know Philly well and we found free street parking in the Grad Hospital neighborhood and took an Uber to the hotel (for about $7 each way).  Second: Lil Jon was in the house.  Seriously.  There was some type of late night event with Lil Jon as a DJ up at the roof top bar.  When we caught a cab back late at night after the wedding was over there was like a whole swarm of people trying to prevent us from crashing the Lil Jon party.  There was even some guy who looked like Secret Service blocking us from going up one of the elevators because that was, like, the Lil Jon party only elevator.  Cool your jets, I don't want to party with Lil Jon that bad.  (I mean I kind of do but you know.)  Come here, stay here, feel glamorous, check out Philly tourist traps, learn a little history, wear a leopard print robe, read Alice in Wonderland, and maybe party with Lil Jon.  This place rocks.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 5.0

My al pastor tacos had a minuscule, nearly undetectable amount of meat. The meat didn't taste bad but after one bite it was already gone! Also the way they do the tacos on the menu is completely backwards. They have an a la carte system that's utterly pointless.

"Ordered through uber eats two combo plates among other things and was shorted 2 egg rolls with order.   This restaurant recently changed to smaller containers that do not even hold a quart of food which is what they say on their menu as late as November 2021 for the large size. Also noticed, weighed the package with shrimp with lobster sauce combo dinner plate at 21.3oz and the package ways 1.4oz so you are getting 12.1oz short of a quart (32 oz) now AND they increased all their prices on the latest menu anywhere from 10% to 33% more for LESS food.   Also, you get chicken fried rice now instead of pork and if you want pork you have to pay $1 more.   In addition, I placed a $40+ takeout pickup order recently and paid the extra $1 on two combo plates for pork fried rice, and when I asked for sweet and sour sauce they had the audacity to ask me for another $1 for a thimble full of sweet and sour sauce. Ridiculous and cheap.   Furthermore, they use imitation crab meat in the shrimp and lobster sauce, as if that is a surprise though.  Lastly, my $40+ takeout pickup order qualified for a free wonton soup because it was over $35, and previously they always provided 8 wontons with a large wonton soup. They only gave me 6 wontons per soup to make up for the free soup! But hey I guess I did get 2 extra wontons and some broth! What a bargain!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"First time in Nashville. My husband and I were celebrating our first wedding anniversary. Several friends recommended us to go to the Gaylord Opryland Hotel while we were there, it is an impressive resort. It all started great from the valets that parked our car letting us know the parking would be free once our ticket was validated. Once we got to the restaurant we received great service from the door all throughout the meal. Tony was our waiter and he asked us if there was any special occasion we were celebrating, we let him know about our anniversary, he brought us a flower for the table and he asked what my favorite type of dessert was and brought us a delicious chocolate cake at the end of our meal.   We ordered a bottle of wine. I ordered the roasted chicken breast which was cooked perfectly and was really juicy. My husband ordered the Carolina trout and he loved his food as well. We ordered a mac and cheese for the table and it was absolutely amazing, it was so much food we had to take the mac and cheese home (it was still great after being reheated).

With Ker being a dallas cowboy, and us being from texas, of course we ordered the dallas, hot, medium, and garlic parmesean. The hot didn't have enough heat, it was just a mere tingle of the senses. I did enjoy the dallas flavor.  The setup of the restaurant - might I dare say - is exactly like Hooters except it exemplified its goods and products a lot more - and I'm not just talking about the chicken wings! Same bootyshorts, same socks, shoes, same shirt manufacturer? The wings were cooked in the same style as Hooters - plump, breaded and just massive. 50 wings might've been a BIT much between 4.

"If you want to stay somewhere that provides quality, compassionate service during unrest among this political climate- this is probably not the place for you.  My boyfriend and I stayed here and arrived in Philadelphia on the first day of the George Floyd protests happening. Where we stayed is tucked away into a small road and so we assumed it would be a rather safe, unassuming place to be. We joined the protests in the late afternoon and headed back to the hotel once we witnessed target being broken into. Just to be cautious, we had packed all of our belongings aside from non essentials and left them at the back door.  We called the manager of the hotel as there were multiple businesses on fire within five hundred feet of us. This is when we learned that there is no sprinkler system in the three bedroom townhouse. What an amazing amenity! We did get the phone number for one of the employees that lived down the road in case an emergency had happened. We were also offered to have one day free due to us being uncomfortable and to keep us from changing hotels.  Turns out packing our bags early was for the best. Around 3:30 AM someone had come to bang on the door and rang the doorbell multiple times. My boyfriend took two minutes to get to the door as he wanted to ensure nobody was inside. However, due to this climate I knew what the knocking and doorbell was for. This is used typically to check for occupants before breaking in and/ or setting a fire.  We were not willing to stick around to find out.  Of course, 911 did not answer as the entire city surrounding us was lit ablaze. My boyfriend was on the phone with the manager who was more worried about how the back gate would be locked if we left. I was on the phone with my brother who had a similar experience years back. Since we couldn't get to 911 and we weren't sure of what was going to happen- the fire alarm was the only option. Following this was the sweet low volume of the alarm. Just imagine what would have happened if a fire actually WAS set! I can promise you it would certainly not wake you up.  I ran back on the perfectly dry (remember there's no sprinkler system in place) floors back to the patio. We grabbed all our things and we had to venture out into the night of Center City during looting and riots.  Once we crossed the road we did see that personnel had arrived to our late hotel, appx ten minutes after the fire alarm was activated. Once we arrived to our next hotel only 450 feet away (The Warwick, 10/10 service and care).  My boyfriend was on the phone with the manager and had been lectured by her the entire time rather than being helped. The conversation was just about how it would effect her rather than the safety of her tenants. We were entirely horrified for the past half hour as we had essentially evacuated the hotel. Even once we arrived to the Warwick she was still lecturing my boyfriend on the phone. When the phone was handed to her husband the tone changed and we were told we'd be refunded in full for our stay.  Turns out there's more than just a lecture in store from this woman. There's also false promises! What a surprise amid the anxiety we had experienced before. We only got back approximately 40% of our money and was hit with a cleaning fee we were never informed of. Get this, she tried to give a snarky attitude in the email telling us this two days after the event.  ""There was also a good amount of cleaning required given you used both bathrooms and the whole house for just shy of 24 hours.""  I wasn't aware I wasn't allowed to use the rooms that we paid for. I dearly apologize for the inconvenience.  Oh, I'm also sorry I didn't have time to tidy up a couple of cups, plates, and empty the trash can for you while we were under the impression we were in danger! I'll make sure next time I tidy up while there's multiple fires around me.  We also had to pay for them to get the fire alarm reset although to me, this sounds more like a business expense than something to put on the backs of tenants who needed help. But oh well.  We had a wonderful time and service at the Warwick and honestly, if your main concern is location I'd suggest booking there. They will actually care about their tenants and be able to offer legitimate help if there ever was an emergency. There's a sprinkler system, PA system, and an actual alarm. It was also real nice to have security available rather than essentially being told to hide in this little alleyway and hopefully you'll be fine! Oh yeah and I'm taking money away from you even though I promised a full refund.

"Ok, so I was a little afraid to stay here after the reviews I saw on yelp, but I turned out to be pleasantly surprised!  There was someone going on at The Opry I think, so we couldn't get in anywhere else.  We ended up staying on the club level, which may have helped my experience.   Arriving at the hotel, the valet promptly assisted me with alerting a bellboy and helping to get my bags out and onto the cart.  Shortly after I arrived in my room there was a phone call, which was the bellboy asking if it was safe to come up. (not his exact words, but still it was great to get a little warning before he just showed up at the door). The room was pretty average Sheraton-style, but mine was clean enough (thank goodness - the ""bed bug"" reviewer scared the sh@# outta me).  I also didn't have any hot water issues and everything worked: lights, wifi, TV... No issues for me there unlike some other reviewers. I was traveling with my parents and we all met in the club room for the free appetizers and drinks.  The drinks were not free, but the bartender poured me an entire wine glass full of Johnnie Walker Black Label for the price of one drink, so I was more than satisfied. The location was great, we walked down just a few blocks to the main strip and had an easy walk back (despite stumbling from the numerous beers we'd imbibed). In the morning I awoke to Nashville spread out beneath my window.  I used their fitness center in the morning.  It was ok.  Average Sheraton, but there were two rooms - one cardio and one for weights.  Could have used some fans and more attentive staff replacing towels and such, but despite this snafu I'm keeping the 4 stars because for a Sheraton that I was a bit afraid of, I had a very nice surprise waiting for me at this hotel.

They are doing construction which made getting an idea of where I was a bit difficult but they have shuttles that take you to the cafeteria and what not. The shuttle drivers are just as great!  As far as the cafeteria goes, it is the BEST cafeteria I have ever been to. It was a bit small and the sitting area was crowded on a daily basis but the food was great!  I was quite impressed with Roche instrument, facility and staff.",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 5.0
"Great service, great location, and great food! Bareburger was a great burger experience for us, each burger tasting unique and delicious. They have limited outdoor seating, but plenty of indoor seating if you want. The service is friendly and they try to get your food out to you asap.   We got the Brussels sprouts to start and they were so crispy! The asiago cheese was a nice touch and really brought out the flavors. We loved these so much that we got our own asiago cheese to make the recipe later! The burgers were hearty and tasty - you can't go wrong with any of them. We chose some of the bison burgers, but I would definitely try any of the other ones, as well as create your own at some point.   It was a great experience overall and I would come back at any time. Definitely a great alternative to generic burger spots and they have gluten free options which is great!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

I made an appointment to sit down with Mr. Black for one hour. Going in, I knew nothing about diamonds.

He had a great collection to look at and gave me his honest opinion on everything. He was very patient with me and I appreciate that. No doubt, you won't be disappointed by Mr. Black.

"Bad News! Don't sit at the bar here and think you will have a good time. Likely, you will be admonished by the bar staff and manager about laughing and talking. The football game was on 2 of the bar's TVs but the 4 of us that were watching, eating, drinking and spending $$$ were treated as unwelcome guests. I was very disappointed, especially because I had already paid and overly generously tipped the bartender. Afterwards we received disapproving looks and constant motions to be quiet. I walked through the dining room and noticed there were no more than 10 customers in the place. So we needed to be quiet - for what? They should have been glad to have happy patrons in the place.

"I went here while on vacation. It was right down the street from my hotel, so my boyfriend and I decided it would be a great first place to go and grab a drink and a light dinner. The place looked great and comfortable to be in. We were given a table and some menus. The waitress at first was pretty cool, she gave me a really great selection on a drink because I'm not a wine or beer drinker. This was all before we looked at the prices. Now, we understood that being on vacation we were going to spend some money, but only when we got to the city of Philadelphia, not in this small outskirt town. However, the prices here were outrages. We then ordered a meal that we thought was for two, because it was a $20 meal and seemed like it came with a decent amount of food, however our waitress order us both this meal. So, it ended up being a $40 dollar endeavor without drinks. We ordered two fillets and fries. We were not offered any steak sauce, nor any ketchup, nor was any of that stuff on the table. Also, when my boyfriend finished his beer, even though the waitress walked by, we had to stop her to ask for another drink. Now, I could understand if the place was empty but it wasn't. There were about three other people seated, and I had seen six waitresses in total while sitting there eating. Was the food good? Yes. But, the most I would've paid for it was $12. Not $20. If you're looking for a cheap drink, don't go here.

"I tried this place with my girlfriend (see Kala's review) while out running errands. The atmosphere and feel reminds me a lot of Panera Bread and Sweet Tomato's. However, what surprised me the most were the prices. Given that this place is located in Green Hills, on the same block as the mall, you would expect it to be moderately to expensively (not sure if that is a word) priced; yet, instead, despite its location the prices are a bargain for what you get. I mean honestly, $7.85 for a regular size bowl of pasta and a soup or salad... who cares if it does not include a drink, I'll drink water, as that is an awesome deal!  Moreover, in an age where american society expects large portions, for once there is a restaurant that realizes that quality, not quantity, makes a better meal. I had the mac n cheese with meatballs and a side Caesar salad, and that was just enough for me, and it was all delicious. I also tried some of my girlfriend's butter noodles with seared chicken, and that too was just awesome! Now if american style fair is not you're thing, then they also have both Asian style dishes such as pad thai and udon, as well as Mediterranean dishes like spaghetti. Not only that; but, along with chicken and meatballs, one can also have shrimp, beef or tofu as a ""meat"" option on your pasta dish. Vegetarian or carnivore, this is a great place for those wanting a quick bite or on a small budget.  Funny thing is though, growing up my dad's mom always told me that if I keep eating noodles all the time, I would turn into a noodle. While not true, when craving noodles there is no place better than Noodles and Company.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

He and his wife Jonanne, have worked hard to make their pizzeria one of Boise's best dining experiences.   Tony takes pride in serving food made with only the freshest, finest and authentic ingredients.  Being Italian himself, he knows a thing or two about the food and how it should taste (never doubt him).   The pizza is to die for; thin crust with just the right amount of sauce and topping.  The house salad is delicious, but the Arrostiti is out of this world.  There isn't anything on the menu that would disappoint; it's as good as it gets.

There are tables, booth and bar seating available. It is cramped in the waiting area though.   The place was well lit a lot of natural lighting from the large windows and it was very clean inside and organized. The hostess was really nice and helped us out with seating options.

"We had reservations for two at 6:15. We arrived 15 minutes early so we had a few minute wait. We were taken to a four top with four covers. First impression of a 5 star restaurant not very good. We were seated and waiter took two of the covers off. So now we are left to move the covers over to where we we actually seated. The waiter Hunter tried to do his best. He went over the drink specials and I believe my wife had a Knockout. The drink was fine and she eventually had another. I on the other hand am a 2 beer a year person. I like pale ales and chose one. Off goes Hunter. He comes back and bartender didn't pay the beer vender it seems. I couldn't get a Sierra Nevada. Maybe I should have stopped to the Circle K and picked them up a 6 pack. I chose another pale ale. Off goes Hunter. He came back disappointed. My second choice refused. I let Hunter know just to pick one and bring it back. The vender must have liked Lagunitas IPA and gave the bartender a freebie. We chose an appetizer, the CheeseSteak Egg Rolls. Sounded interesting. Two little egg rolls came back they looked lonely save for the sweet and sour sauce. It saved the day! As I normally do I get up to use the restroom. For a 5 star they could have spent a couple extra dollars in there. You do your business and wash your hands with the sparse soap afforded and low and behold the entire roll of Paper Towels is just sitting on the sink. Where is maintenance when you need them. Hunter did well on my return by offering up specials not on the menu. We declined the Shrimp Calamari I think that's what it was. So we were set to order main course. Hunter recommended to me a 14 oz Aged New York Strip and my wife chose the Salmon. We added sides and we were set. He put in the order and started assisting the next table. When he did his orchestrated prep he mentioned the Shrimp Calamari to the table. That table wanted that item. Off Hunter goes and to no surprise on my face the Chef told him that item was no good and they won't be serving it. I'm now in shock It's 7 ish and not only are beer choices OOS but the Shrimp Special has been 86'd. Well needless to say we received our meals and I'm not a fan of the deconstructed plates. Even in fine dining restaurants I get the entree and the sides on the same plate. This was a tad confusing when there comes a plate of Asparagus, a plate with a potato, and a plate with a steak on it. Folks I don't mind my food touching! The salmon was excellent says my better half. The steak seemed as though it were aged in the desert sun. I've had aged beef before and it was tender and juicy. This steak left me wanting. The highlight of the meal for me is when Hunter through his diligence with remembering details honed in that it was our anniversary. He swooped in with a complimentary desert and two glasses of champagne.

"This is a review for both the hotel and casino.   CASINO 1. Smoke - all the reviews about the smoke are 100% TRUE. Upon entering, you immediately feel weighed down by the smoke. My eyes became itchy within 5 minutes. The smoke and the smell follow you from the Casino up to the hotel hallways. Thankfully the hotel room we stayed in did not smell of smoke, but the hallways and casino are reeking of it. IF YOU HAVE ASTHMA, DO NOT COME TO THIS CASINO. The ventilation needs to be updated, especially since most of their patrons are seniors. 1/5 stars  2. Staff and service - no complaints here. From the slots to the restaurants and bathrooms, the staff were very helpful and pleasant. Also, one cool thing is if you sign up for Club Sol, you get a dining voucher that gets you up to $25 off. We were three people so we got 3 vouchers equal to $75. You can use this for all dining EXCEPT PY Steakhouse and to purchase drinks. Still, the vouchers came in handy. You can use one voucher per meal OR combine them. Our bill for Ume was $105 and we decided to combine two vouchers to get $50 off. We ended up only having to pay the difference. It's a great deal. 5/5 stars  3. Cleanliness - the casino, sans the smoke death trap, is actually well maintained. Overall the casino is nice. Even the bathrooms impressed me because they were all so clean. There were no overflowing wastebaskets, no clogged toilets, and no wet countertops or floors. Even the staff at the buffet were always cleaning the counters where the food was. Pool was clean too. It was obvious that the facilities were kept well. 4/5 stars (knocked off one because ventilation is part of cleanliness in my opinion)  4. Restaurants - 2/5 stars. We went to 3: festa lunch buffet, Ume, and Mobys. All were subpar. See my individual reviews for each for details. Short version: great service makes the dismal Casino del Sol dining experience bearable.  HOTEL 1. Rooms - spacious, very clean, well maintained, nice ambiance. Thank God the smoke didn't enter the room. We stayed on the 8th floor with pool view. I was also very impressed with the bathroom. It felt very luxe even without a tub. 5/5 stars  2. Pool and jacuzzi - beautiful!!! And heated! Even though it was 65 degrees out, we jumped into the 85 degree pool then to the 102 degree jacuzzi. Very clean and well maintained area. This is definitely a highlight. We didn't get to try the Oasis bar because the bar closed at 5 pm and we decided to take a dip around 7 on. Towel retrieval and return was very easy. It was also nice we had the WHOLE area to ourselves to enjoy. 5/5 stars   3. Service - again, staff was very attentive and responded to any questions or concerns we had. I requested for toothbrushes and toothpaste and they thought it up to us. They also didn't give us the standard small skinny hotel toothpaste...we were given a travel sized Crest toothpaste still in a box! That might me nothing to some, but I'd rather get that than the small hotel toothpastes that are good for one use and taste like chalk. 5/5 stars  Honestly, if the smoke problem is fixed and the food quality of the restaurants is improved, I would definitely come back.

"I have been on double decker bus tours in the UK several times. Maybe I was hoping for better, or judging this based on past bus tours. I have a few issues with this tour operator.  First, we joined the tour near the Reading Terminal Market. We waited about 30 minutes for the bus that comes every 20 minutes. When the bus came, one of the few double deckers apparently, there was no room to sit up top. In fact, there were only two seats near the driver. So we sat down in poor air conditioning and listened to all the sights we were missing because we had no window. We drove almost half the route before we could switch seats and go upstairs.   The driver, Schultzy was his name? Has constant road rage.. like rage in the cage. Anyone who slights him gets the horn and he gets pissed off. Maybe he was having a bad day, I don't know, but why guys with short fuses want to drive a bus in heavy traffic all day, I dunno.  Then there was our tour guide -- Eric. Between screaming into the microphone and making lame jokes, there were a few sights he pointed out that was pretty interesting. Then he started to make jokes about the toilet paper they used to use during the revolutionary war. At this point he decided to jump up and grab leaves off a low hanging tree. You would think that after hitting the passengers in the head with the branches he was pulling back and then snapping in their faces someone would punch his lights out, but no. I am thinking the bus must have been full of dumb Canadians who typically apologize to the person who wrongs them.   This went on and on and eventually he got other passengers into thinking it was a good idea. Soon everyone was reaching up for tree leaves and snapping their neighbours in the faces with tree branches.   Eric then told us all about the time he was nearly shot outside a Philly's game for wearing a NYY jersey. He and his brother who has been in jail upset a Philly's fan and decided rather than be shot, they would just evade him for the rest of the night and tell all the tourists at his day job about it again and again.  As the tour neared its conclusion Eric decided to let us all in on a big secret and informed us about the genocide of the indians by the US government 200 years ago. He then went on and on and on about it until the last stop.  After getting off the bus he had the class to take out his hat and hope for tips for the great service and interesting tour he provided.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 1.0
"It is small and the boutique is a mix of old things, new things and handmade jewelry. The food was excellent and the croissant was incredible. It was not the gargantuan ones made here and it was flaky and tender .They import them from France and bake them fresh about each half hour. We got there just before 2 and the only choices left were quiche or chicken salad on croissant.  There were a couple of breakfast croissants and a few desserts left. There is green tea on the menu, but they only had ginger peach, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  They had a full coffee menu. Other beverages are canned or bottled soft drinks. We had the chicken salad on croissant which came with a delicious side salad. The owner and server were each quite personable. On July 1 on HGTV there is an episode of the owner working on putting together her cafe.  She assembled a counter out of a slab of granite and an old door and did some tiling near the door. I will gladly go back.  Had I arrived earlier and had more choice this would have been 5 stars.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 4.0

The service is always excellent though, and I do enjoy the food. It will fill you up, which I guess is worth the $7 for a burrito. They would have my business a lot more if they took down the anti-gun sign (this is Arizona, not California), otherwise I'll be taking my business to La Salsa.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I am not a big fan of Emiril's restaurants because I usually think you pay way too much for the name and the quality is not usually any more superior to any of the other local NOLA favorites.  This place does small plates though and it was priced just right. We spent about the same amount as we do when we go to the other of his  restaurants, but you get to try so many more things, each of which are delectable. We enjoyed this place so much, we went back two days in a row. Who thought just a cheese flat bread could taste so good (St James flat bread) We had three of the flatbreads which were all delicious. The second day the brussel sprouts weren't as good as the first because they didn't have quite as much bacon the second time, but still very good. The ribs melt right off of the bone so you don't even have to get your hands dirty at a nice place.   Smoked fish dip was very good. I also really liked the croquets. The boudin tamale was just ok and I probably wouldn't order it again. The only thing I didn't like at all were the fried catfish fish tacos. Too much ""taco"" and slaw, not enough fish. They also had more of a tempura crunch rather then a catfish crunch that you expect from New Orleans fried catfish.   I should also mention that our server on the second day was absolutely terrible. I felt really bad for his back waiter if they split tips just between the two of them. He asked if my daughter wanted water and then proceeded to bring out an adult sized water glass which was bigger then her face and kind of reacted strangely when I asked if they had a plastic cup. I understand it's not Chuck W Cheese,   I could see they had them sitting on other tables with kids. He then eventually brought one without a lid or straw (which is what the other kids had). I should mention my daughter handled it fine, but she is two. There were so many other things he did that made no sense and kind of ruined the experience. Had we not had such an amazing time the night before with good service, it would have almost changed the entire opinion of this place.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I have now been sitting in their restaurant for 30 minutes, counting flies and code violations,  waiting for them to find someone who has the authority to fix the order .

"I went to El Pollo Loco to use some coupons that had arrived in the mail. BIG MISTAKE. The employee taking are order was unprofessional, rude, and sick. She kept coughing everywhere. She arrived to take our order with food in her mouth and said ""sorry I'm on my break"". If you're on your break why are you in the kitchen eating with your fingers??? We were already there so we ordered a burrito and a chicken plate. The chicken was dry, the salsa was sour, and the chips were handled with the sick employees bare hands even though she didn't wash them after taking money. I was grossed out but didn't want to take the food back because I felt they would do something to it. The employees in the kitchen were eating with their barehands and even when there were no customers they didn't bother to clean the drink station, the bathroom that stunk of bodily fluids, or the tables. I took a few bites of the burrito I had ordered and tried to enjoy the meal as best as I could which wasn't much considering the radio they had on the dining room was an advice radio show with people ranting on divorce and cheating. That is not what I want to listen to when I'm at a restaurant. I went online and filled out their feedback form leaving a detailed summary of what happened, my email, and my phone number. It's been 4 days and no one has gotten back to me. I'm never taking my money there again. Food was not good, service was terrible, and the place was dirty inside and out. I'm surprised they are still open. Surely not for long....   I don't want to see a reply for someone directing me online because I already did that. Clearly they are trying to save face.

The younger guy was nice too.. the older guy with an attitude from the get go was very lucky I was asked to just let it go.. These young professional adults were out to have a good time and were PAYING just as anyone. This guy was LOOKING for trouble and A FEW times tried to accuse them of disrespecting his country.

HE could handle his tough guy act with a better delivery.  He seemed to have an insecurity and was always throwing cocky looks at these kids. I says KIDS because I was there with my friend and we are 53! They are kids to me and GOOD kids.. I was very prepared to call him out on his rudeness! We couldn't understand him but at one point he said You think you my first delco? Huh? Get the f outta here. When the party first came in, they did funny tests on the mic acting like Pro's, he yelled  Can you shut the F up?

I called the shop before and was assured that the order was on it's way, another 10 to 15 min later and still nothing. I called the shop again and was told that they never received the online order. A flat out lie. Why confirm an order is on the way, if you never received it. We must have spent atleast $250 or more there this month alone. No apology, no value of customer service.

I was a little overwhelmed with the cheesesteak dog and ended up eating the cheesesteak meat separate from the hotdog, it was just a little much for me all together.

"Some customers would LOVE the fact that the Mile High Gentlemen's club opened and shares the same parking lot with this hotel. My two young kids got a kick out of the ""house"" next door that changes colors a lot and enjoyed watching the guy dancing around outside our window with a sign advertising ""girls, girls, girls""  But as a mom traveling alone with my two kids 6 and under to visit a nearby sick relative, I would certainly have picked a different hotel had I known this.   We arrived late and stayed on west coast time, meaning that we were often crossing that sketchy parking lot at night, and even had a man get in front of me while I was waiting to check in to see if they had a last-minute room available that same night. The proximity to this ""gentlemen's"" establishment is great for some types of ""travelers"" but not ideal for us.  If it weren't for the neighboring strip club, I would say the place was fine for the price. The hallway to our room reeked of cigarette smoke but the room itself was fine (guess the smoking guests simply head to the hall to avoid the stiff penalty for smoking in room).   The construction directly outside of the hotel on the main road caused a water main break that made our shower a trickle on the check out day, so I couldn't shower before our travels that day.   Some of the planes directly overhead on the flight path to the nearby airport are huge and so not only make loud noise but also actually shook our room. Fine for us- we just kept our fan running in our room which mostly drowned the distraction but some lighter sleepers might have issues.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 2.0

"We have been to this location multiple times. We have had good food which is why there are two stars and not just one. The last trip, in February, we got there shortly after they opened for lunch and they were out of the appetizer we ordered. It happens but odd that it would be within an hour of opening. We ordered our entrees and were informed about ten minutes later that they only had one order or the entree we both ordered. Fine, we'll share it. Twenty minutes later it comes out. Burnt, dried out, and inedible. As if they sent out the scraps. The meal was taken care of which was great since we didn't eat anything but the appetizer we'd ordered to replace the one they didn't have.   That brings me to tonight. We arrive 15 minutes early for our reservation. We check in and the hostess informs us she will text us when our table is ready. We went outside to wait and wait and wait. Finally after we had waited twenty minutes after our reservation time, we go back to check and watch her give away our table to a couple that had just walked in. We approached her and she had forgotten about us and was just seating folks as they walked in. We will never waste our time again and will be sure to let folks that we had raved about the food to not to bother either.  *Update* Just received a notice that we no showed our reservation. We not only check in but when we watched her giving seats to walk in customers we let her know to cancel the reservation because we could not wait any longer.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Unfortunately, they lost our order, so we had some delay getting ours, but it was piping hot and fresh when it came. We got the Forbes (pepperoni) and the crust and sauce were nice (crispy, thin crust and fresh sauce), but the cheese was very salty and the whole pie was really greasy from the pepperoni. Maybe you'd like that, but if not, avoid that one.   Don't miss the awesome Hawk Krall mural full of Philly characters out back and all of the pizza memorabilia scattered around.

The interior is beautiful, cute, charming and welcoming, but our experience outside of the ambiance was not equal to the decor. I ordered a kale and faro salad with chicken.

All good, but when we asked about our missing food the server asked if we really wanted them (lol).   My salad consisted of massive chunks of kale-- and the kale while super fresh and good had maybe 10 kernels of faro in it, it was just so strangely prepared. Everyone else seemed to like their food okay but it didn't seem to be anything special.

"My experience here has been less than stellar. My last visit was probably my ""last visit"", as the TWO hour wait was the deal breaker. While I do not question the expertise of Dr.Galib, I do question the outrageous gouging for the prescriptive lenses that I purchased there. After waitng three weeks for progressive lenses, I took the same script to Costco so I could have something to fall back on. The charge from Paoli Eye Institute was listed @$518, ""discounted"" to $440. The same script taken to Costco was $130.  We are not talking rocket science here. This was for lens only. Worse, I went to the Insitute on a day the optometrist ws not there, was handed the shipped box and saw the invoice for $92?! Really?? Talked with the optometrist personally who tried to explain the high markup...not buying it. Buyer, BEWARE!",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 2.0

"We came here for a friend's 30th birthday in hopes of having a special night. The Boilermaker at least succeeded in making it unforgettable.  I walked up to the bar and made my first drink of the night a citywide special for ""$5,""  getting $6 out to tip. The bartender pours a shot, opens a can, and I give him what I think will be a $1 tip. He comes back with 50 cents, saying tax isn't included on the menu. ""Fucking Philadelphia taxes, man"" he says. This part isn't on him, but what's the percentage of bars that don't include the price of tax in the drink? Who leans up against the bar to buy a $5 drink and expects it to be $5.50?  Stuck with a gleaming 2003 and a nicked 1986 George Washington Jr., I was unsure if it was poor form to tip change, and didn't have anymore singles, so I figured I would leave him $2 when I got singles on my next drink.   Instead, he sees me take the change and *yells* across the bar, ""If I knew you weren't even going to leave 50 cents I wouldn't have even served you! It's cool, it's not like I make $3.50 an hour!"" He then proceeds to call me an asshole and bad mouth to the barback, other patrons, and even my friends. I didn't want to ruin my friend's birthday so our group left without confronting him, but honestly, I was almost too shocked at being treated like that to respond. It was the most crass, inappropriate service I've ever experienced. Even if I had no intention of tipping, is 50 cents from one citywide order worth reacting like that? Think of all the drunken antics you've seen in bars - *that's* worth absolutely losing your shit over?  That's who you want to try to embarrass in front of a group of strangers?

"A wonderful restaurant with great ambience, tasty innovative dishes (roasted prawns were delicious and the olive leaves wrapped appetizers were very original and succulent), but with inattentive extremely spotty and rude service across the board. Were it not for the food quality and general ambience I would have given them 2 stars.   We went there on January 8. A very cold evening.   It was not a busy evening for the restaurant. Their dining room is very spacious. Only a few tables were occupied. After we were seated, we waited for over 15 minutes to even have a waiter come to our table. After we placed the order, we waited for even longer (and our orders were not complicated dishes; see pictures). The service was very spotty as they forgot about some of the dishes we ordered. We had to chase them up.   When serving us, the waiter was extremely rude. He came with our dishes. Dropped them on our table without even making eye contact or saying anything. He kept walking (as he dropped the plates) and just zoomed past our table.

Also, if you are with a group order large fries don't do individual orders of fries because you will end up with a lot of fries if everyone orders fries. We ordered two large fries and that was enough for us plus you need room for your sandwich. I would go there again. Our staff person was really nice and helpful.

"I sat down for lunch and without looking at the menu ordered prosecco.  The waitress brought out a sparkling wine but it definitely tasted different.  When I looked at their menu I saw they have only 'cava' and 'brut'. She'd given me cava but I wasn't complaining, it was sweet and refreshing.  I wanted a sampler of their appetizers, and the waitress pointed to something on the side of the menu. I just said ""OK"" and was brought a plate of 6 different mezes.   The plate came with cheese 'fingers' which were surprisingly good, stuffed with a strong, stringy white cheese.  The grape leaves were stuffed with what seemed to be meat (beef?) and a hard couscous. They were warm but not the best I've had... then again, my father-in-law makes *amazing* dolmas so... it's tough to compete. This was my first (and potentially last) time eating falafel... the outside was *very hard* thought at least crunchy. The inside has a nice flavor but it just wasn't 'my thing'.    I loved that there was an option of 'wheat or white' pita bread and I got the mix. It was quite good, if not served warm.    They love their tahini here, and it shows up in the eggplant dip, which was quite better than many I've had, as well as in of course the hummus - which was also good.  Each spread (and the plate itself) came with a few spoonfuls of oil on top, but all in all it was a very good and filling lunch.  Also my waitress was kind and brought bottled water for my puppy, as NoLa was having water issues that day.  If I lived in the area, I would definitely go back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Years ago my husband and I used to go to Red Lobster to celebrate things. We lived in Colorado at the time and Red Lobster gave us decent seafood at an okay price. We hadn't gone to Red Lobster in over two years and when we drove by this place we decided to go to reminisce. The last few times we had gone to Red Lobster we hadn't liked it as much, I think we had started finding better food.  We were seated quickly and the place was pretty slow, though there were a few tables. Our server started out good but then he got sat with other tables and became understandably busy. Our food was brought out by someone else and it tasted...okay I guess. Definitely sub par to what we have been eating since we moved to Florida.   We finished and waited for about 10 minutes. Another server must have seen us looking annoyed and came to check on us. We told him we were waiting for our check so we went and got it from our server. Unfortunately we needed change. Eventually the same server from earlier came back to get us change. We saw our server constantly but didn't actually speak to him once after placing our order. The service wasn't great, but he was busy so I can understand.  The service isn't what will keep us away though, it was the food. While it wasn't horrible there are just way too many better options in the Tampa area than Red Lobster.

Over the past 9 months we've been back 3 or 4 times and it keeps getting worse. The nachos are a shadow of what they used to be and the entrees keep disappointing. Service has also slowed to a crawl and it is clear they obviously don't really care. Tonight, we had very long waits and two completely awful entreez.  The waiter apologized on behalf of the manager by giving us a $5 off coupon. That didn't even cover the cost of one beer let alone the two inedible entrees we had.

I'm not kidding; I saw at least 20 little bunnies.  If that doesn't make you happy, I don't know what will! Not to mention this whole resort is ON THE BEACH! There is an amaaaaazing view from every single place on the resort.  It is a fantastic place to  relax and enjoy California life.  I was in a state of utter bliss from the second I stepped foot on their property.   The 82 degree heated pools are treated with saline instead of chlorine.  This makes them MUCH better for your skin and hair.  Thanks Bacara!  There are tons of delish restaurants to choose from on the property, a gym , hiking, and best of all you are steps from the beautiful California coast.  Let's talk Spa; fabulous! I got two different massages while I was there. (I am a beauty journalist after all) I got the standard Swedish and added a Lime Scalp treatment which was amazaballs. My massage therapist did a lot of extra things to make this treatment so special. Nothing perverted, but everything did feel really good!  The next day, my birthday, I wanted to try something completely different from the basic Swedish.  I have known about Ayurvedic Beauty for a few years now, and have always been curious to try it.  When I saw Ayurvedic massages on the spa menu I got really excited and booked a treatment.  I won't go into all the details about Ayurveda... I'll save that for another blog, but I will say that it is a different approach to health and beauty and it originated in India.  The Ayurvedic massage was unique and fantastic.

My friends and I wanted to grab a quick bite for someone's birthday, and Ikura was pretty close to our school! I believe this place used to be a Little Tokyo  Seriously, I'm just gonna get straight into why you SHOULDN'T be here. There were NO redeeming factors about this visit besides exiting.  First off, just don't get the ramen. GO SOMEWHERES else, you won't regret it. My friend had the ramen and said it was WAY saltier than it should be and just didn't taste remotely right.  And for the finale! The homie and I ordered the Bulgogi Bento Box.. but isn't bulgogi Korean? Oh well, I like bulgogi, so ima order bulgogi. I had the face of excitement when they was walking towards us with the bento boxes. As they served it, my smile turned upside down. AS GORDON RAMSAY WOULD SAY , "" IT'S FRICKIN' RAAAAAWWWWW!"" It was so raw that you could still milk it with the utters on. It was so raw that I could defibrillate it and it would come back to life. It was SO raw that it was advertising to ""EAT MOR CHIKIN"" at CHICK FIL A! I am NOT exaggerating ONE bit.. that bulgogi was STRAIGHT OUTTA RAW. I was, as Drake would say ""I'm Upset"". I called my waiter over to say that it was raw and if he could take a look at it. He honestly, at first, did not listen and say it was supposed to be like that. I don't think he was seeing what I saw. The meat seems as if just kissed the grill, it was served raw. I told him to please touch it, smell it, feel it, anything for him to see what I'm seeing. He honestly didn't listen and just took my word for it and had it sent back to be cooked again. It came out shortly.. and it was still raw from small bits of it. It just threw me off.

I ordered a platter of chicken enchiladas in a mole sauce that came with spanish rice (nice and moist), salad of lettuce and tomato, and refried beans (not a thick mixture, much thinner, almost like a sauce, but very tasty). The highlight for me was the Mexican coffee, which was fragrant and lightly sweet. Heavenly! I'd go back in a flash (if I didn't live so far away). FYI the waiter came running after us half a block because my husband left his change purse on the table. Great and friendly service. There were only a few tables full the day after Christmas, so I can't speak for the service or noise level with a full house.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Extremely Disappointed - these words sum up my impression of The Grove.  Venue:  As a wedding venue, The Grove is okay, just okay.  Prior to attending a wedding here, I had heard positive things about The Grove so my expectations were high.  This is especially true knowing that the wedding couple had paid $12,000.00 for the venue.   However, upon arriving, the first thing that struck me was the small size of the room and the outdated décor.   A small buffet table was set in the back of the room (for adults) and another table was set to the side of the room (opposite of the outdoor space, for the kids).  There is a nice outdoor area on the side, which can open up to accommodate more guests, however, the best use for this venue is small, intimate gatherings as any guests sitting outside would not feel inclusive in the event.  Needless to say, I was not impressed and highly disappointed.  For $12,000.00, it just wasn't worth it.   Food:  To add to my disappointment, the food was, in the words of several guests, ""nasty.""  For a venue that touts its own chefs, the food was bland, utterly lacking in taste   In a city full of hotels and other wedding venues with delicious buffets and food offerings, I have never been so disappointed with food at an event.  There was supposed to be enough food for 150 people, and it just didn't seem like there was enough for that many people; maybe there was enough food for 150 people to get food once, but seconds was out of the question!  To make matters worse, the buffet wasn't ready on time.  $12,000 for bland food, and not enough of it, just wasn't worth it.    Staff/Service:  Not friendly.  Rude.  Slow to replenish food - I saw people standing and waiting in the buffet line, for at least a few minutes, for the food to be replenished.  We received complaints from our guests as to how they were treated rudely by the staff, and the slowness of the service.  There was a woman there who we were to go to with requests, etc., and she was also rude and slow to fulfill our requests.   $12,000 for poor service, just wasn't worth it.   Final note:   The Grove was unable to accommodate our requests for additional tables to be set up, the reason being that the wedding couple had confirmed just 150 guests.  Legal issues (parties to the contract) aside, we have never encountered a venue's outright refusal to accommodate more guests in such a manner.  I have attended weddings at the Red Hawk Golf Course, ballrooms at the Peppermill, Atlantis, El Dorado and other area hotels, and at each event, the venue accommodated the family's request for additional seating ON THE DAY OF THE EVENT, in exchange for additional funds.  We were told that there would only be enough food for 150 people, so additional tables would mean too many people for the food to be prepared.  In retrospect, that position doesn't make sense as there wasn't enough food for 150 people anyway.    So, if you are looking for a wedding venue that will have delicious food, courteous and friendly staff, as well as nice décor, DO NOT USE THE GROVE.  If you're looking for a venue that will work with you to accommodate guests who may show up last minute, DO NOT USE THE GROVE.  If you're looking for a venue where you will get your money 's worth, i.e., most bang for your buck, DO NOT USE THE GROVE.  Believe me, your money will be better spent elsewhere and your guests will thank you for it.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 1.0

"Guys, I hate to give you one star but you really blew it on Friday.   I'd ordered a vegetable stir fry with chicken; after a 30 minute wait and multiple reassurances from the server that it would just be a few more minutes, I told him that I needed to hustle up to make my flight and asked for the food To-Go. When he went back into the kitchen and, I would think realizing that my order never actually got started, the server himself starting grilling up a very pitiful chicken breast, some hastily-assembled vegetables (4 zucchini chunks and two very small onions by my count afterwards) and brown rice that I watched him fry for a total of 15 seconds.  He scraped it all into a box and handed it to me with a shoulder shrug and a rushed apology; I had to ask for plastic silverware and a napkin so that I could actually eat my To-Go food on the go. When I hustled through the security line and tried to eat as I went, the veggies weren't cooked through and the chicken was terrible.  I pitched the food into the garbage - $16.99 down the tubes - as I sprinted to make my plane in its final boarding phase.  C'mon, Mountain House Diner - you guys weren't even busy. I'm confident that you can do better than the sorry effort you put in on Friday. Major bummer.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"This place is a total hole-in-the-wall, strip mall Chinese restaurant.  But it's good!  Food came out extremely quick (probably because there was only 1 other party there when we went on Sunday night) and hot.   Prices are very reasonable (most plates under $10).   No liquor license.  I wish there was a little more ambiance.   It feels like a takeout-only joint, minus the takeout window.   The floors are pretty dirty and there's not much in the way of decor.

"I'm sorry. I loved the hotel it was beautiful and everyone was welcoming but once we got to the bar it was a whole other story.  For starters it seemed that they didn't have anything! Every drink we would ask for we would get a return of....sorry we don't have raspberries, we don't have that beer, you can't order that entree broccoli is recalled, nope still don't have that drink, that menu isn't updated.  I'm pretty sure this is a new restaurant and they already don't have an updated menu??? What is going on?? We even heard people next to us trying to order a standard jack and coke and they didn't even have Jack Daniels!  At the end for us instead of being upset we found it more comical and were taking bets on what they would or wouldn't have if we asked for something.  The staff was another thing in itself.  When we first sat down it seemed like we almost had to beg the bartender to take our drinks and once we did we got the response up top.  She did not seem friendly or happy to be working there. She would repeatedly in front of guests take out her phone and start texting completely  ignoring that people were waiting for refills or to order another drink. It seemed no one got along with anyone. There was a server trying to do her job and the bartender  was being very nasty to her kind of made us feel bad for her. She let the manager know what was going on and it seemed he even knew how the bartender was and tried to shrug it off and tell her to ignore the bartender.  We had such a great experience at the hotel but this restaurant is severely lacking. I guess on the plus side the food was good, once we got it.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 1.0
"I haven't been here in YEARS...and I was reminded why. I only came bc the group I was with was, for some odd reason, craving Red Lobster. Actually, I think it's bc we kept talking about their cheddar biscuits, which is deliciously good. Very buttery, soft, and I'm sure VERY bad for you. One was enough for me.   We did family style and shared everything. For an app we got the white wine and roasted garlic mussels. Entrees we got the Bar Harbor Lobster Bake, Seaside Shrimp Trio, the Ultimate Feast, and the Parmesan Crusted Fresh Tilapia. Honestly, everything was average. The shrimp scampi was pretty oily, the linguini Alfredo was a little more on the drier side, but other than that, it was okay.   Aside from the food, our waiter was great and very attentive. The atmosphere of the restaurant itself just seems to be lacking. It's very dull in there. If I ever crave some biscuits, this is the spot I'll come to, otherwise, I won't be in too much of a rush to come back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Once I flipped out, she decided to make me the drink, however she was slamming the cup on the counter and rushing the whole process. 3. Now, I hope am wrong about this 3rd point but I get this feeling I get treated this way because I am not Asian which is disappointing because I drove 20 mins to buy this bubble tea.

"We have been to this restaurant a half a dozen times. We really liked it at first, good food, service and energy. The service has started to decline at a rapid rate though. Today was our last visit. We walked in, there was literally one other couple eating and clearly the staff was bored. The young lady that seated us never spoke and after walking us toward a booth laid down the menus and just kept walking in one fluid motion, like she was annoyed. After she brought the salsa back and put it on the table she again just walked off with no acknowledgement of us whatsoever even when I said ""thank you"". After we sat for 5-6 minutes straight waiting for any sign of wait staff I was ready to get up and leave. The staff that was on the opposite side of the restaurant finally noticed us and then had a hearty laugh among themselves that they did not know we were there. By this time the other 2 ladies had left, leaving us the ONLY people in the restaurant. The waitress was friendly and took our orders. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time however, the worst part.....a man that was in a golf visor type of hat that looked to be some type of manager was preparing the food on the bar just outside of the kitchen. Anybody in the restaurant can see this bar. He stood at this bar talking to the staff that clearly had nothing else to do while adjusting his visor and scratching his head. He would then walk over to a table and touch items like menu's etc. THEN he went back to the bar when my salad was up and added the tortilla strips with his BARE HANDS after touching other items and his head. Another person had come into the restaurant at this point and I can't take my eyes off of this guy to make sure that I have seen what I think I have seen.....AND HE DID IT AGAIN! He spooned up pico de gallo to add to a plate and balanced the pico with his dirty bare fingers. So that alone was enough for our last visit, but the service was some of the worst I have ever had. Clearly this is an issue since the place was empty and was the last few times we have visited. We waited for our check and this picture is what the staff was doing for the longest time. We finally had to wave her down to come back and my husbands drink was empty. She could see us from this spot the entire time, but never looked. If you want a job that requires no energy, hygiene or manners this is the perfect place. I posted a pic of the 3 staff members as well.

Heck, from my house this place and another location are both about as close by; about 5 minutes in either direction.  This location, due to its location, is of course popular with Vanderbilt students. I would expect a wait if school is in session and it's a weekend.   For the money, well you are getting what you pay for. It's a step up from ye olde Taco Bell since you get to sit down, they serve margaritas, and there are fresh chips and salsa. Other than that? Well, I've had better and I've had worse. Like some other Mexican places I've reviewed, don't expect gourmet and you'll be fine.

"Stopped in here recently (for the first time in years) for a friend's birthday party. Carrollton Station is an oddly configured neighborhood dive bar. Carrollton Station is named as such, because it is catty-corner from the Carrollton streetcar barn.   Small selection of drafts, though selection was reliable and decent (couple NOLA and Abita brews, I think a Brooklyn and Magic Hat #9).   Not much was happening the night we were there, but there's a stage in the back. And there was a sign for some kind of race starting at the bar involving strolling while drinking, which I found highly intriguing.

"Ciccio's definitely deserves an updated and recent review but walk in any day or night of the week, andyou know they don't need it. Why you ask? Because they are always packed with regulars. Regulars who know the quality of this place and the TLC they put into their food.  It is a rare find for a restaurant to actually have SEVERAL healthy options and especially so many that taste great and not like cardboard.  They have a main menu which doesn't change. They have a chalkboard that is updated daily with a LOT of seasonal options and then they have a monthly finer dining type menu. A tiny place with a lot of variety and that is what keeps me going back. For the most part, it's my favorite take away. Reason why... I am a food snob and I am not that excited to be in a strip mall. However, they are currently taking over more space of the previous Blockbuster tenant that went out of biz. I hear they are adding music, a bar and more seating. I think this is what will take this place to the next level.  It's within 2 miles of my house and across the street from the gym.  You will always find people here in workout gear because they know they can get some really decent and healthy options.  Great ahi, delicious wraps and bowls, some of the best crab cakes I have ever tried and a nice little beer and wine selection to boot.  Try this place for yourself...    Don't listen to the review from Angela who says it's obvious that the two good reviews were from employees.  You can check my profile and it's obvious, I am not an employee.

"Gotta say, I wasn't overly impressed with this place.  I was expecting more of a ""fun"" atmosphere considering the name.  Maybe I just a different sense of humor.  It was surprisingly elegant looking inside for what it was...meatballs.  Obviously you get your order very quickly because they just have to pick your ball, put your sauce on it, and that's it.  I feel like you're kind of forced to buy the 4 baller item if you want any different meatballs.  I don't eat that much these days and only wanted 2-3, but if you buy just 2 you have to get the same flavor/sauce.  I feel like you should be able to mix and match no matter the quantity.   We were seated immediately.  But I have to say I really didn't enjoy our waiter.  He stood over my back and bent over me to touch my menu, while I was holding it.  It just really made me uncomfortable.  After we received our meal, he never came back around to check on us or refill our drinks.  I wasn't overly impressed with the meatballs, I thought they'd be really large and they weren't.  We were suggested to get the brussel sprouts.  They are the same way I make them at home.  The waiter said all the sides are for sharing with 2 people.  But when we got the brussel sprouts it was just in a small bowl.  It was about the size of a helping I would give myself at home, but it was meant for 2 people.  And because the sides are a la carte, you can quickly add up your bill if you keep adding sides.  We opted for just the 1 side.  The sprouts were flavorless and needed salt and such.    I'm not sure if i'll be going back to this.  I can just get meatballs at a local Italian place, and honestly the meatballs and sauces I tried that were outside the traditional Italian meatball, just didn't taste right together.  The fajita one was particularly unenjoyable.    I was excited to try this place for months and was so glad a place opened in Carmel.  But the prices are just a little too high for the smaller sizes of meatballs they are and I just didn't enjoy the staff and overall stuffiness of the place.

The pork chops were very tough and tasteless the eggs seemed like they had been left out forever and don't even get me started on the hash browns.. they were soggy and seemed as if they came from a freezer (even if they didn't these were the worst things I've ever had). To top this off I requested the owner just to give her my thoughts politely and she was EXTREMELY rude. Also as I watched her interact with her employees I saw her treat them poorly.. I even asked one of them and they gave me a half smile clearly not wanting to give their boss any more of a reason to be an asshole. I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS PLACE. Could definitely be replaced by something better, I say if you are thinking of eating here.. don't. Go to Squeeze In where you can get great food, service, and cleanliness.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"So, I found this place on Yelp and decided to check them out. It's a short drive from my home, but I've been twice now. The nice young man, that takes the order is extremely friendly and helpful. I was very impressed, how when I returned the 2nd time, he remembered me and that's always a nice touch. The pizza is AMAZING, just enough of EVERYTHING and bursting with flavor. It reminds me of old school pizza, flavorful and their crust is amazing... A few other jewels are their cheese sticks, cheese bread and their cheesecake.   This has become my favorite pizza spot in Nashville. I am less than a mile from a Domino's, Jet's and Pizza Hut, I drive to Donelson for this amazing treat.

Ordered bacon extra crispy. Bacon they brought was only lightly fried. When we told the waitress it was not as we ordered she insisted upon taking back the original bacon to the kitchen to the point of argument. Since when do you have to trade food in that was cooked wrong? She even said that if the kitchen didn't get the original bacon back there will be a charge for the correctly cooked bacon. Obviously they're going to serve that bacon to another customer. We've been coming here for 15 years. It's a shame the service has declined so much.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Unbeatable location in the center of French Quarters walking distance to everything. Drawback is loud noise from street entertainers at night and transportation is not permitted during promenade hours so if you are checking in after 5 pm make sure your driver knows the back route to the valet/garage parking area. David, the manager, managed to upgrade us to a balcony room facing the inside courtyard plus offered us free beer tasting at the Opera bar. Lobby is very inviting, pool was not heated but lounge chairs provided, the cafe offers breakfast buffet at a very reasonable price, there is also room service available. Bathrooms are on the small side with french doors, no in-room fridge, and daily complimentary water bottle provided. My complaints are: popcorn ceilings in the rooms, shower bar was loose in our bathroom, concierge never called us back when we needed help in booking a tour, noisy housekeepers who chatted early mornings right in front of our door and took forever to clean our room (one of the 4 days we came back at 4 pm to freshen up before dinner & they just started cleaning our room).

Truffle chips didn't come with any sauce but we're still good plain. Bacon with tomato jam and bread was really good the sweet of tomato complemented the salty bacon well. Had the Shepards pie for entree. Was different than most of the one I've had before. The meat and veggie mixture reminded me of French onion soup. It was kind of sour but still good.

"Best Vietnamese restaurants I've found in Philly area! Most people go for pho at a Vietnamese restaurant which is great. But I would recommend you guys to try out Bun Rieu, the crab noodle soup! Not every restaurant is serving it. It has a heavy tomato soup base, served with crab meat and tofu. The crab meat is the soul of the dish, giving the soup noodle the fragrance of seafood. The texture of the noodles is perfect, thin and soft. It feels so good eating a bowl of hot noodles in winter!  When you order the food, you can ask the waiter to not add the greens (e.g. cilantro, onions...). When they bring you the dish of basil and bean sprouts, remember to add them immediately. The bean sprouts would taste very raw if you put it later in your meal. Remember to squeeze the lime! Yumyumyum!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"My fiancé got my engagement ring from Benari and I cannot even begin to tell you the level of service we got here! The only reason why I know what happened behind the scenes is because my fiancé (bless him for this) videotaped the whole thing.  Joel Cohen, our jeweler, went above and beyond by not only helping my fiancé to create a very memorable video but he was able to create a one of kind custom diamond engagement ring from a short 10 second video my fiancé showed him.  Joel created a 3D computer aided drawing of the ring and kept working on it until it was absolutely perfect!  Not only did I get an awesome video with the two of them planning, plotting, and preparing for the big surprise, and an unbelievable one of a kind custom made ring, but Joel was able to pull all of this off in less than a month!! I had to thank Joel in person after the proposal because honestly after watching the video (and crying tears of joy throughout the whole thing) I had to thank the one jeweler out of the 4 jewelers my fiancé went to, that could pull off this huge task. No one else even attempted to make a custom ring.  Everyone else just coldly dismissed my fiancé and said ""Sorry that's not something we can do"".  Buying an engagement ring is so much more than just looking into a glass case and picking out just any ring...you are buying a once in a lifetime experience and Joel Cohen at Benari Jewelry gave us that moment, for that I will always be grateful!!

"On Friday April, 8th, 2016, I had an appointment with one of the doctors. I was told two medications were going to be called into my mail away pharmacy plan. As of the last week in April I had still not received my medication so I called my pharmacy and they had never gotten the prescription called in. I called the same day and spoke to the doctor. The doctor apologized and said they would have the prescriptions called in.  Today 05-04-2016 I phoned my insurance carrier and my pharmacy. Still no prescription phoned in..... 05-20-2016 - two days ago, the doctor called me quite upset and said that their feelings were hurt and that the trust between Doctor and patient had been broken because of what I had written on Yelp. The doctor said more than once, I should find a new doctor. I said I could find a new doctor but that would not fix the problem that got the yelp review. I was trying to get answers and treatment by calling multiple times to both my insurance carrier and my physician's office and that I had not been given answers. My Insurance Carrier had denied the scripts were ever ordered. The first time I called the doctors office I had been told the computer system had been giving them problems during the time that the prescriptions should have been ordered. Perhaps that was the problem. They were apologetic and said they would put a note on the file and have the proper person call me back.  I called several times after that but did not get my medicine until 05-16-2016. The office manager called me either 05-18 or 05-19. She was genuinely apologetic. She said she was researching what exactly had gone wrong. I told her that the employer who provides our insurance is large and has an aggressive patient advocacy department. If I had known what the problem was, they could have assisted me but I did not know what to tell them. I am sorry that it seems it may be necessary to find a new ophthalmologist.

I would return to this restaurant.  Visited for second time June 2018. Food is outstanding. They know how to make a great pizza and specialty pastas. The small plates are very pricey for what you get. I had the scallop crudo in blood orange sauce. It was great but for $17 it was quite small - looked like one scallop sliced into 5 pieces.

"Honestly I'm pretty frustrated with my experience at Lashes Del Sol. I was a pretty regular client for about a year, I bounced from locations and girls depending on my schedule and how my lashes turned out, but I never had a bad experience there until about 2 months ago (give or take). I scheduled an appointment with Marisol because she's the owner and I felt she'd do the best quality, unfortunately her flight was delayed so they had to set me up with another girl, which I was perfectly fine with, so they set me up with Gia insisting she did gorgeous lashes. The lashes itself turned out nice, but my experience with Gia was anything but. She was unpleasant, unfriendly, and not gentle whatsoever. She neglected to tell me she used a stronger glue than the other girls, which irritated my eyes and became clear when I began crying and she ignored me for the longest time, until she finally rudely asked if it was that unbearable (um, YES). My appointment was over 3 hours long, and extremely painful leaving my eyes irritated and bloodshot for a week. I had no interest in returning after my experience, but due to a time crunch and the fact that Lashes Del Sol has more openings and lash artists, I chose to return to the oracle location and try a different girl, Misty. Now let me be perfectly clear: Misty was a night and day difference from my awful experience with Gia, she was friendly and accommodating and I enjoyed her. However, it's clear on the website a full fill takes about an hour 45 minutes to two hours. I came in at 11 (appointment was at 11:15 but we started earlier), and I had left myself around 2 hours 15 minutes of a window before I HAD to be somewhere, I also let Misty know I had to be somewhere right after my appointment as well. I was unaware that Misty was new, and therefore (understandably) took her time and had her work checked by other artists. However, I did NOT have 3 hours to spend, and if I hadn't asked for the time (my lashes still weren't done) I don't know how long I would've been stuck there. Again I want to be clear: Misty did a phenomenal job on my lashes and they were exactly what I wanted, and I do not believe she was at fault as she is fairly new and was taking her time. That being said, I do think management needs to take more consideration into informing the clients of things that may change their appointment. I would've appreciated being informed that new lash artists may take longer, and given so been given a discount as I still paid full price. If a different or stronger glue is being used, the clients should know in the beginning in case they may have a bad reaction. If I was informed that my appointment may take longer given the experience of the lash artist, I would've made necessary arrangements. I would return to Misty given her quality work, but only when I had the time allotted to do so. Please inform your clients better before they're put into a situation they weren't expecting.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 2.0
"I stopped in on Saturday afternoon for a late lunch/early supper with my two young children, wife, and mother-in-law and we had a great experience.  The service was super friendly and patient and everything I ate (buffalo wings and the burger) was excellent.  Very nice beer list, very diverse, with a bunch of stuff I've never seen before.  The only complaint from the table was for the fish taco, its actually more of a wrap than a taco and not what was expected... good flavor though.  Everyone ordered a dessert and loved them, I had the seasonal cobbler, it tasted like it was made to order and was fantastic.  I will definitely be back next time I'm in the area.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
Worst unprofessional spa I have ever schedule at. I was given a 7 pm  appointment and I was about 2-5 minutes away from the sap when I was told that my message was cancel because my therapist went home. This was my very first time there-- did not request any particular therapist so any therapist could have done my message. They claimed they call my cell to cancel me but lied because they never call . By the way this was my birthday gift because it was B-day. They ruined my pampered day for my Birthday.  I paid for a package: message and manicure/pedicure but they offer the manicure /pedicure not the message.

"I just got out your pumpkin patch upset for the bad manners and the way we were treat by the guy working there. I noticed right the way the kind of bad mood ugly person he was right the way when my son came in I barely set my foot at the and he greeted us with a really bad attitude already, then he was onto us like he wanted to scold us first thing that he could think of, my son was quite throwing ""fern"" at the car all the kids were playing. This guy that works for you came scolding my son and me because he was playing with the fern. He was not, not even a second polite or not nice to us, I told him when I was leaving that a person like him should not be working with kids, and should NOT. He responded with a smirk on his old grumpy face ""I stand with what I done"" is this the new way of America? Being treat like a shit when we are customers and peaceful? This is awful! I am mother,  student I help the community I know people with high academic education that would treat a dog better than he treat us. Really disappointed and I am sad I that my son had to go through this, what was supposed to be a magical moment it turned out to be horrendous. Shameful, and I am glad that I did not bought the pumpkin I wanted, and I will certainly not going back for my Xmas tree.

"I'm really thrilled that a nice gym opened up near my house.  I have belonged to Ironworks, and then City Fitness which was fine (but the parking sucked), but now a nice big gym with a ton of cardio equipment and a parking lot?  Too good to be true.    I can only speak for the women's locker room, but it's very spacious with several benches, lockers, areas to change, etc.  A couple showers, toilets and sinks as you would expect.    The words of encouragement plastered throughout the facility are reminiscent of ""The Biggest Loser"" (from what I've seen on the show) but I dig it.  Hey, I could always use a little push.  There have to be about 30 treadmills and another 40 other cardio machines (bikes, eliptical, arc et al).  Lots of weight machines and free weights.  I think the heaviest free weight I saw was 50 lbs?  This is definitely the place to get fit, not really the place for huge gym rats who want to bulk up.  I like the 30 min workout area, although often times there are a couple of meatheads using the equipment (while their friends watch) and not following etiquette of the green light/ red light system.  That part is annoying and I wish the staff would do something about it.  They are open 24 hours a day Monday-Friday.  7am-7pm Saturday and Sunday.

"For someone who doesn't usually like sports bars, I really like this place. It's big, inside and out, but never feels too loud, too crowded, or too sparse. The space has enough different zones that you always feel pretty at home. For a sports bar, it's got a great food and drink selection, and despite having a ton of big screen TVs, the volume is never too loud to carry on a conversation unless it's a really bar-encompassing game, like a World Cup match. I don't mean ""for a sports bar"" in a derogatory way, by the way -- but different bar styles have a different priorities, and this one definitely doesn't seem to confined to the mold.  One of the best things about Front Page is its huge patio. Every once in a while they have some live music, which happily livens up the whole block, but is usually low-key enough that it doesn't get in the way of conversation. It would be awesome to have temporary TV access on the patio for a big game, but in general I'm glad that there's a zone of the bar without TVs -- especially outside, where it would be annoying to neighbors and pedestrians.   Nice spot, especially for big gatherings and big games. You really can't go wrong.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0

"After getting some first day jitters out of the way, the service has been pretty good. Very friendly people, very quick service.  They make your sandwich as you are ordering, so I had to repeat myself a couple times, but aside from my first visit, the food has been made accurately.   I would still like it if there was more readily available information about what toppings you can add to a sandwich. I find myself reading each custom sandwich description to find what is available for toppings (I just realized they have avocado spread).   They do that weird thing that Subway does (or maybe used to do) where they rip out the inside of the bread (presumably to make more room for the meat, but there aren't large portions of meat).  I am a firm believer that the bread can make or break the sandwich, so I always see this practice as a detriment.  The bread itself wasn't bad, it would have been nice if all of the roll made it into my sandwich.  The second sandwich I ordered, I asked them to keep all the bread in, this was a better sandwich than my first.   The hoagie itself was still nothing to write home about, my usual Wawa hoagie is better.  The one thing that this place has over Wawa is that there is a drive through, and the speed that you can get in and out of there. This place works if you don't want to get out of your car (or want delivery).",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

The food is mediocre at best and mostly far below mediocre. The lettuce on the salad bar was brown and wilted. The hot foods were barely warm. The sliced meats(tri tip, sausages) were tough and cold. The lobster was inedible, overcooked and tasteless. What they call drawn butter, is more like a warmed vegetable oil.  The dining area is dated and dirty with the overwhelming smell of stale cigarette smoke. Not very appealing or appetizing.

"LONG POST but I want the manager to read this since he didn't seem to get it last night;  Also, I requested the owners email address to send my review to him but he refused to respond back so I will just post it on here:  I came in on a Saturday night at 5pm.  We didn't have reservations so we figured we would have to sit at the bar.  This man immediately walked up to me and started asking me questions, he then told me I had to get in line to show my vaccination card. I am not from Philadelphia so I did not have it on me.  I asked him if I could order takeout instead he said yes and to ""stand over there away from the guests"" (close to the door).  I then see others showing a picture on their phone (which could be anyones card) which I did not know you could do so I asked my husband to text me my card. I sit at the bar to order my food and noticed the manager (Brendan) talking to the host and bartender and looking towards my direction.  When I gave the hostess my card she asks for ID.  She did not ask anyone else for this information, then the bartender who was originally pleasant refused to serve me (per Brendans request I'm sure).  I sit at the bar waiting for my food with my friend when Brendan walks up to me AGAIN asking for ID, we reminded him that no one else was asked for this information, he told me that the host should be asking every guest for ID which is an absolute LIE, he only requested that MY ID be shown.  I just paid for my food and left, very frustrated as I am a mom of three from out of town and never get a chance to go out.  I was looking forward to dining in.  The takeout was just so so.  Not sure what the issue was, hoping its not a race issue and I don't even like to make those assumptions but it was very obvious he was obsessed with me from the moment I walked in.

Don't be deterred by the long line because it moves fast and the Mod staff are super friendly and move at lightning speed.  I made my own pizza with a garlic rub base, pesto and mozzarella. Added fresh basil and olive oil, pepperoni, Canadian bacon, pineapple, Greek olive mix, sweet and spicy peppers, Asiago, parmesan and gorganzola and probably some things I forgot to mention. Cooked super fast and then topped with more pesto and a balsamic fig glaze. HOLY PIZZA, it was great! My peeps all loved their creations as well. We ordered the cheesy, garlic strips with a side of pesto too and it was so good that we placed an order for two more.  Their pesto is top notch! Because of the soft opening pricing, my pizza, my guy's pizza and 3 orders of strips was only $15!  We'll be back many times once they are open for regular business and I think they'll do well in this location. They even have patio dining.  **I went to the counter when we were done and told the guy at the register what a fantastic job they were doing and he turned around and said to all the staff behind the counter,  ""This nice lady said we're doing a fantastic job!""

"I tried this place for the 1st time a few weeks back. Twice actually. I decided to forgo the usual corner chinese food and see what this place was about. I don't know why I was expecting it to be uber expensive.  I ordered take out because that was my intention with my meal for the night.  It was really crowded in there on saturday evenings which made me happier that I opted for take out.  I got the spring rolls..delicious. They have pretty darn good egg rolls also. Prob the best I've yet to taste. I also ordered hot and sour soup. I then had the crab fried and shrimp fried rice and the triple delight.  The triple delight was okay. Felt like something I could get in any other place. But the fried rice was a winner.  I went back a few days later for another take out, but this time I got the yummy crabmeat shumai and the Gunpowder shrimp. The only part I didn't enjoy about the Gunpowder was that there was something in the sauce that I had to keep spitting out. It tasted like shrimp skin but then I saw it was the pepper flakes/skins? Either way, it was an interruption to my  meal. Shrimps were large and meaty. Love that.  I def enjoyed my meals here so far.

Besides the food being sub par and mediocre to begin with, the waitress was extremely nasty and rude. How in the world can you be in the service industry with that type of attitude and/or demeanor? You work a table so that you can earn a tip. Come off as rude, arrogant, or just down right nasty, then you get nothing. Come off as being more friendly and attentive then you should be able to secure a pretty good tip. This was a case of the waitress been just down right awful and when she only received a $1.00 tip, she was clearly and visibly upset like she couldn't believe it? Lol. Is she kidding me?

Their biscuits are fluffy and light but not greasy.  One of the chefs suggested I try the Tennessee Hot Brown from their specials menu. It was their breakfast biscuit version of the Kentucky Hot Brown sandwich. This was a great suggestion because it was mouth watering delicious. The fried chicken breast was so juicy and fresh. The Parmesan Romano Moray sauce they used really added a unique and succulent flavor to this dish. We also enjoyed the bacon avocado omelette. It was packed with really good flavors. The service was very fast and friendly. The vibe was very family like and the interior reminded me of a nice little country like cottage.

Drinks are also very reasonably priced, between $7 and $12, with the exception of $17 for The Zombie (limit 2 per customer, this drink includes a whopping 5 oz of alcohol)!  To emphasize how serious Chris is about his craft, he actually makes his own tonic water and bitters. I was so intrigued by the tonic water, I started with a Gin & Tonic, which utilized the fascinating, amber colored tonic water. And it was lovely! I also had a Gin Martini, stirred, of course, and it was perhaps the second best Gin Martini I have ever had (sorry, no one can beat Musso and Frank on that one, in my book! :-) ). Finally, because Chris raved so much about the Whiskey Cocktail, the world's Oldest Known Cocktail, claiming it is the ""Old fashioned, Old Fashioned."" Basically, it's an Old Fashioned without the muddled cherries and oranges. It DID, however, include him lighting some orange zest on fire! And he's not kidding.... that was a GREAT drink! I would highly recommend that any bourbon or rye fans try that one.... heck, even try it if you're not a whiskey drinker. My husband isn't a whiskey fan, but even he thought it was delicious!  Speaking of my husband, he started with a Tom Collins, which includes a special, homemade Collins mix that my husband fell in love with. And since he likes it girlie, he moved on to a Mai Tai, which he liked, but it was apparently a very strong drink, and it made him become super drunk!   Also, the drinks are all presented in the traditional fashion.... Mai Tais are served in a Tiki mug and garnished with an umbrella, Moscow Mules come in copper mugs... great attention to detail!  Anyway, I really can't praise the bar enough. Everyone from San Diego to San Luis Obispo who likes a classic cocktail owes it to themselves to stop be here at least once!  Here's the cocktail menu, for the curious:  http://www.slysonline.com/sly%27svintagecocktailselections",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 5.0

"What a hidden gem for Citrus Park. The food is amazing, as are the drink prices. It is a super friendly neighborhood bar that will greet you by name on the second visit. The bartenders and servers work hard, and it is evident. The food is in the top five for the area (not even for a bar, in general) It is family oriented, but a great bar to stop by for sports.

"I realize that there's a lot of deliciousness on this menu, but I have a go-to order that's pretty much perfection. And you don't mess with perfection.   Chips & guac to start. Short rib torta for the main event.   The guac has just the right ratio of ingredients to leave the avocado super creamy, the onion not punching you in the mouth, and just enough bite.   The short rib torta...yum...I eat red meat about 3 times a year and I 0% regret that this is one of them. You don't even need the little salsa cup that it comes with.   The only downsides: super loud and pretty much always crowded except for weekday lunchtimes.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 5.0

It was everything I wanted it to be and more. The fries were fresh and there were a lot of them, even in the small size. The burger was cooked perfectly and the bun was perfectly toasted.   The sweet man that works the register let us know they were having a special and serving Greek gyros so my husband ordered one with lamb. That was also fantastic. Great pita and delicious, flavorful lamb. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good burger or even a good gyro.

The staff is top-notch and always remembers me and strikes up conversations. The chips and salsa are awesome, and so is everything that I have ever tried here. I usually get one of the dinner combinations. They also make great margaritas -- especially the sangria margarita. The prices are typical of what I've seen at most Mexican restaurants. I've been to all of the Mexican restaurants in the area and this place wins by a landslide.

Huge bits of red peppers and eggplant smothered in cheese with yummy peppers and onions. And here, I was worried that they wouldn't have anything vegetarian! They may have only had one sandwich option listed, but it was pretty darn delicious. The bread was delicious. Buttery and cheesy, and amazing in all regards.

"Tequila/margarita and tacos bar plus event space is having a soft opening... Shhh Ashley kept emphasizing soft opening till September 1 from 4-9 PM Monday to Saturday (regular hours after grand opening plus sign & phone number later)  The 100 person event space with most shocking feature.  The 2 large barn doors looked more than wall decoration and I'm glad I asked about it.   Barn doors rolled open showed the large event space. (Check pictures including chandelier)  Back to da tequila/margarita bar- Is it really rustic with 3 HDTVs? Nice selection of tequila across the high shelfs...plus nice step ladder so Ashley can get to them! There are also local beers offered.  My quick meal before work- $7 combo- 2 brisket tacos with a side of rustic caviar... caviar with no fish eggs, never mind. The taco has soft flour shells & were ready very quickly.  The 2 had enough tender brisket (same owners of Southtown Pub) & pica to satisfy. The ""rustic caviar"" was a tasteful melody of corn & beans w/ lime(?) give a fresh flavor.  Full disclosure- Ashley is friend on Facebook & announced the soft opening today.  I read about Southtown using the event space before, but didn't realize the two spaces were connected.

They have expanded the offerings here from beyond just golf to all sorts of different traditional athletic games along with arcade style video games.  The games here are done in lanes that are like rectangular rooms where you have a lot of space to interact and I even saw some folks bringing their own real golf clubs to play here.  They have revamped the menu a few times and the current menu is more of pub food style along with some items that kids will probably like too.  My Big Texan burger was HUGE and the fries were crisp.  The service was friendly and attentive while giving good suggestions about the menu.  They sometimes have daily specials and seem to be working towards more of a bar scene during the later hours while being more family friendly earlier on which is the case with many places in the area.  It certainly seems like an interesting setup with their games approach and I want to get back to play some of them and try this place out later at night as just a bar & lounge.  Overall this is a decent spot for lunch and they have their own parking area which makes it easy to access.  They have an above average bar menu and it never seems busy during lunch so you can get in and out very efficiently.  It might be a fun place for their games and night life but I haven't experienced those here yet.

The restaurant have been around since 1952 same location, small BBQ restaurant, a lot of regulars that go there quite often, and it's that good comfort foods. I ordered a larger tips with sweet sauce, and a side of extra sweet sauce. I didn't wait long for my ribs at all, it was only a few people inside during my purchase, and the lady who taken my order was very nice as well as knew her regular customers. When, I ate my ribs at home it was still very hot & fresh, ribs so juicy & tender. As, I'm writing this I want more. Lol. The last time I was at that restaurant was around 2-3yrs.

Three of us went there last night.  Beautiful night so we sat outside immediately. Our waitress was wonderful.  The drinks are a bit pricy and small but very good.  The by the sea app was fair.  A little too fishy for me and I'm not sure the scallops were true scallops and not monk fish.  The fish spread did nothing for me.   My entree was very good.  I had the soles pork over gumbo rice.  I wouldn't call the rice gumbo rice just gumbo flavored?  It was a little dry but still tasty.  The pork was perfect.  My table mates had rib burgers.   One liked his the other did not.  French fries were awesome and so was the Mac and cheese.   Our waitress kept the ice water bottles full and we could not have asked for better service.  Only four stars?

"I have been to Lolita's many times.   It has the feel of an interesting, small, independent BYOB in one of the liveliest restaurant corridors in Center City... that is, it did until now.  This past weekend, Lolita was just as crammed full and loud as expected.  Immediately, we were off to a bad start: the annoying cash-only policy made it necessary for one person in our party to step out to a nearby ATM.  Although we had arrived as an entire party, the sullen, inconvenienced host informed us bluntly that we were not to sit at our table until our missing diner returned, although our table was directly in front of us and more than half of the restaurant was empty.  When another member of our party began to ask her a question, she purposely turned her back, to make a point of ignoring him, and then walked to the other side of the restaurant, to pretend she was checking on something, or to fold a napkin or something.    We nearly left.  We had already wasted so much time on this stupidity that we stayed.  The margarita mixes are OK. The food was tasty enough, but not special.  We had guac and other appetizers, and each ordered main dishes.  Someone in our party had the carne asada, which unlike other reviews here, was just an unremarkable steak.  I had the short rib, which I could have made at home, dumped Doña Maria mole sauce over, and achieved the same result.    As we received our food, we continued to watch as the restaurant put other parties through the same unreasonable, curt treatment, making them stand awkwardly beside their table, to grow increasingly more irritated, rather than just allowing them to sit down to enjoy themselves.  Our experience convinced me that this is no longer this nice, little, independent Mexican bistro we once thought we knew.  It still draws a decent number of people, but that's just its location.  It's really now just another boring corporately run ""ethnic concept"" with mediocre food that anyone could find in other parts of Center City. And because of the crap service and police-state treatment from the host, all 5 of us are fine never going back.  Consider Las Bugambilias on South St. instead.  It's consistent, with a larger menu, great for dates or small groups, and it has far more personable service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

After waffling heavily, I ordered the Oriental Almond Stir-Fry with seitan, and ManFriend got the Mediterranean Chicken Breast with the mango-butternut mash and julienned veggies.  We started with the sweet potato balls with chili-coconut dipping sauce, and finished with one of the specialty desserts-- that week, their international dishes were Indian, so we got the mango kheer (rice pudding) with mango ice cream.

The menu is somewhat limited but the food is good and the prices are incredibly reasonable for New Orleans.

I was happy that the bar carried a few seasonal beer options.   Ladies room was clean and nicely appointed.   I ordered a wedge salad, the wagyu, and a side of mac n cheese. The wedge was delicious and fresh. My steak was pretty good and I'd order it again. It was slightly more done than I ordered, but the steak had a great taste and texture.   All of us shared our sides. My mac m cheese was excellent, and I recommend the onion rings! I loved the Fleming potatoes, but the jalapeños in it were not for everybody. Everyone was a happy with their steaks and sides.   We also ordered dessert. I had the cheesecake with blueberry sauce. It was delicious! Everyone else was happy with their dessert, too.

Folks around us had to also send food back as well. The food itself was very mediocre as far as flavor and presentation.

"Fresco Pizza has been a favorite of mine for quite some time. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but it's worth the time to go and enjoy a great meal. The mussels are a great appetizer to split with another, as you get a big order of them, with sauce and a few breadsticks. For lunch, I recommend the Santa Fe Chicken Club sandwich. At $10 (plus $1 extra for fries), it's expensive, but it's fantastic.   At dinnertime, you can't go wrong with one of their pizzas. Most recently, I've had the Paradiso (white), and the Mediterranean (red). Both are generous with their toppings, and were cooked to perfection.  The only reason this is a four star review, rather than a five star one, is that the service is extremely inconsistent. I've waited at the table for more than an hour with no waitress coming by to fill up a drink, or deliver the check. There are a few tables outside, but if you don't have 2.5 hours to eat, don't consider it, as you'll be forgotten and left to go inside to hunt down your waiter/waitress.

"I've been here multiple times because I love me some Popeyes, and since moving this is the closest location to me. Now, call me a foolish optimist, but I kept hoping there's be any kind of improvement to their service. That has not happened.  I once stood at the till for 15 minutes (I timed it and was stupid enough to wait, but figured how bad can it be?) being completely ignored by the staff, who then told us it would be an additional 20 minutes to fry new chicken since they had run out. While that was by far our worst experience and we just left, it's pretty indicative of the service we've received every time.  If you come to this location, you'll wait at least 15 minutes for your order, even if you're the only people there, receive minimal service at best, and your food will be...passable. The staff don't talk to each other and either look bored or completely terrified, and it translates into very poor service for customers.   I love Popeyes, but sadly, will not be returning to this location even though it's so close to home.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Making a reservation on open table, I specifically stated that it was our 10th wedding anniversary. I previously called the restaurant the Wednesday before to confirm but was hung up on twice- that should have been my warning. When seating us, they never made mention of my special request and sat us next to a wall and four other people sharing a bench seat- How romantic! ( lol) I requested a seat change, which they complied. The food - my husband ordered the fish special. That was delish although it stated jasmine rice and they served us cabbage under the fish. I purchased the king crab legs at market price (make sure you check the price- they were over $60). I would not have made mention of the price if they were super good. Unfortunately they were grilled and were burnt and very dry and salty. The chocolate dessert was excellent. The service was slow- over 2 hours for dinner..

"Lounge 125 reminds me of some NYC spots for a few reasons, from the interior design, to the VIP tables - oh, and they're open later than most of their neighbors. (It's a members club; that's $10-$15 for cover, thank you.) The times I've been there, the DJ spun a varied mix of electronic, trance, and hip hop tunes, and kept the dance floor bouncing. It's been awhile since I've stepped foot inside, but I still hear similar thumping beats when I wander by.  Drinks are overpriced (it's Old City) but you can't even order unless you're a paying member (see their web site for details). But hey, assuming you're there after 2 AM, you shouldn't be drinking anymore anyway!

The service was immaculate (there was always someone nearby) and the food was cooked to perfection. We had the crab cake (good but nothing special) the ahi tuna (really excellent) and the calamari (also excellent, best calamari I've had in Indy).

If you sat near the door, then you'd have people breathing over your food waiting to be seated. Cash only which is annoying.   Fair prices and huge portions. My sister got the Virginia ham pot pie dish and it was very good. I got the candy cane french toast. I asked the waitress to reheat it and she said that someone else had already complained about it being cold, but that they were supposed to be that way and the kitchen won't reheat it. She didn't even make an effort to ask the question. Who wants to eat cold French Toast with a mound of cold peppermint flavored cream cheese inside? I essentially paid to eat cold Brioche bread.

"Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Thompson. Located in the hip Gulch neighborhood, the Thompson was by far the highlight of our trip. Here are the highlights: 1. Decor- this hotel is absolutely stunning. It's modern, beautiful, and pays attention to the details. Seriously, we enjoyed just looking at the decor.  2. Front Desk- The service was top of the line. Let's start with Cat at the front desk. She allowed us to check in at 9am! We were just hoping to drop off our bags and walk around until check-in time, so you can imagine how happy we were when they let us go to our room at 9am. When we got to our room we asked to upgrade to one with a clawfoot tub. Cat made it happen. She even offered to show us the upgraded room to see if it would work for us before we agreed to the upgrade. We ended up with a huge room on the 3rd floor that had a walk-in shower and bathtub, record player, and seating area. It was amazing. Cat also emailed us a personalized list of suggested places to visit and was extremely welcoming and friendly.  3. Doorman- I never had to open a car door or touch the hotel's front entrance. There was always a very friendly and helpful doorman on duty.  4. Room Service- I ordered a bottle of wine listed on the room service menu. When they were out of the bottle I ordered they sent me a $150 replacement bottle at the original bottle's price.  5. LA Jackson Bar- we spent two nights on the rooftop bar and it was really fun. There was always mixed age crowd of really attractive people. The wait staff remembered us and our drink orders when we came back on the 2nd day.  6. Marsh House Restaurant- we only had breakfast here, but it was outstanding. The freshly made chorizo and nutella donuts blew my mind.  7. Security- After checkout we realised that we had forgotten something in our room. We called and spoke with security. Security looked for our item and got back to us within an hour of contacting them (it was after midnight when we contacted them).  Overall our experience was incredible! We will be Thompson fans for life.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 5.0

"There is no way I can give anything less...I have been here about 6 times in the last...10 days. I am a bit addicted and won't stop until I have tried everything on the menu.   Everything is DELICIOUS here. I usually don't eat much meat anyways but Vge was the first time I tried ""beef"" and it is absolutely amazing. The bread is amazing and the desserts are amazing as well. Tofu cheesecake, vegan carrot cake, vegan cupcakes...I mean, YUM. The frosting is amazing and I don't like frosting. It's THAT good.  But the food.  The Vgesteak and the BBQ Seitan sandwiches are so so good. Honestly will say I now prefer vegan meat over the real thing. It's not heavy at all yet the flavors are there. Reminds me of mushrooms but way more flavorful.   My favorite sandwich is the Banh mi. Tofu with the radishes and the cilantro aioli work harmoniously. Though heavy on the sauce, the sauce is so good that it doesn't even matter. Not too sweet, not salty. It's very refreshing and you just feel healthy.   Falafel (baked NOT fried. Best part, I think) salad is delicious. Usually falafels upset my stomach because they are fried but these were perfect. Though a bit dense, they were really tasty and you could SEE what you were eating. Very hearty, filling salad with an amazing hummus and tahini dressing as well. Though I enjoyed the strawberry salad, I definitely prefer the falafel.   Have not tried the soups yet but I am definitely going to try the ginger carrot one next time. They change everyday but I'm sure they are all amazing.  Also the staff is so friendly and it is just a great environment to eat alone, with friends, family or co-workers. And plus, you get kale chips with your sandwich when you eat there. BIG plus.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"It takes a lot for me to give a business 1 Star. And staples has repeatedly and consistently provided the most terrible customer service I've ever witnessed!   We give staples print center a ton of work. This work included weekly banners, posters, cards, etc. And each time, without fail, the copy & print center employee is rude and will ignore the long line of customers patiently waiting. However, they will almost always drop what they are working on to help the one rude customer who bypasses the line and asks some mundane question that becomes the immediate attention grabber of that employee.   Even when the customers in the long line speak up and ask why they are not being helped the employee will look past them and mumble some words about being busy and another customer is before them. Today it took asking numerous times if we could receive help, we've been waiting now...18 minutes to be acknowledged, and she didn't look up at us, she mumbled, ""what's the name?"" And stared at her computer. Our posters aren't ready. No explanation and they're back to ignoring us. We received a confirmation email yesterday, 19 hours ago that our posters were ready. They are now standing around against the back corner talking to each other. Still no explanation where our posters are. Still no word to the line of customers behind us.

The service was so good we felt bad telling them how horrible the food was.  We kinda got a little scared when everyone was asking for recommendations and every server at every table was saying their favorite dish was the same thing... ummm I think they were trying to get rid of the oldest fish before they had to throw it out. So I ordered something different, they should have thrown that out too.  I ordered the fish with crawfish in a white sauce I am pretty sure they forgot to season it and the fish was inedible. My husband got the filet it was 4 small pieces that were way over cooked and tasteless. If you are looking for food that probably comes from Sysco with no seasoning that was probably microwaved this is your place.  If you looking for fresh homemade food go somewhere else.

"Let me start off with the good.. The portions were huge, the food (for the most part) was incredible, and the wait-staff was friendly and informative.  But here's the problem. I made reservations for 4, which they had no record of - I later found out through my Open Table account that they cancelled it.. which I've never heard of a restaurant doing before. We were seated and had to wait over 15 minutes for someone to come over. The waiter brought water, but no glasses. We had to ask for silverware and napkins as they weren't on the table. We ordered 2 plates of the tilapia from the menu and ended up getting served the special instead. The rice-balls, while delicious, were cold in the middle. But the most fascinating part of our experience was that we were never given bread. When we finally asked for it, 30 minutes into dinner, we were told that they had run out. Run out? What restaurant runs out of bread at 8:30 on a Saturday night? Meanwhile every other table, even those who were seated after us, had bread. As I was hosting my girlfriend's parents for the first time, this started to get incredibly embarrassing for me.  I realize that they may have been training new staff, but this was my second experience here in the last year where the service was all over the place. Unfortunately, I won't be eating here again - there are too many other great Italian Restaurants in Collingswood with similar pricing to have to go through this again..  It's really unfortunate, as the ""Sunday Gravy"" was one of the best meals I've ever had. I just wanted some bread to dip into it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Five stars for the food, three stars for the mixers.  We actually chose this place because the mixers looked so good, so we grabbed a small bottle of Patron and headed in...    The mixers were decent, but nothing special.  The food, however, was incredible.  We split the beet salad which was good, but nothing that stood out too much against other creative beet salads.  I ordered a hazelnut crusted duck dish with a cranberry sauce on a bed of plantains (delicious), she had the braised short-rib (equally delicious).  Both dishes were some of the best prepared, and absolutely mouth-watering combinations of flavors I had had in a while.  Despite barely making it halfway through my plate and still feeling like I was going to roll out of the restaurant, we split the bread pudding desert (rather, each had a bite and took it home).  Amazing.  Great atmosphere, a little crowded so you have to be open to eating right next to other groups (which can be amusing, we had some pretty funny people - one very awkward first date, one hilarious couple - I can only imagine what was being said about us...).  Definitely worth a shot, we might have had a bad night for the cocktails.  But if you're going somewhere for the cocktails, try a bar.

"If I could stay here forever, I would! It's Probably my favorite hotel I've ever stayed! I lived in Saint Pete for five years. And always only visited to patron the pool bar. But I always wanted to stay. I recently moved to North Carolina, and had to get out due to the shut downs. Hollander was first on my list to stay. It was only $84 a night. I stayed 3 nights. 3 seamless nights. The front desk staff is amazing. Upon checking, they were very courteous and welcoming. My coffee maker was broken, so I went downstairs and asked about a new one. And they brought one up right away. The rooms are clean and updated. They were actually doing renovations while I was there. Updating every room. It's an older hotel, so expect some squeaky floors. But it's beautiful. And has lots of character. There is a pool, a pool bar, and an indoor restaurant. All of which I've had some really good veggie burgers and salads at the indoor restaurant. The pool bar features some good drink specials. And you can sit right by the pool. The staff is next to none. You are greeted  every time you walk through the door. I was even offered water as I walked in after a run downtown. They are absolutely exquisite. There is also a coffee bar on grounds. I was given a free coffee voucher because my coffee machine broke, it was only for a regular  coffee, but the barista made me a chai tea latte. Which I thought was very nice. They also have some delectable treats. So I had some of those. They have all the toiletries you need. Shampoo, conditioner, lotion, face wipes.  The location is the best in St Pete. You're right downtown, with access the bay , and all the restaurants and shops. Parking is included in your stay. The lot can be a little tight, but they also have overflow parking.

The manager was very kind to apologize and comp a few items off of our bill but as this hotel is slotted for our company travel it makes it very convenient to dine downstairs but needless to say, I will never dine in this establishment again and I am sure my colleagues also will not because after a long day of meetings this is not the service we would like to receive.

We collectively decided it would be a perfect time for a reading (given the start of a new year) and after reading the reviews on Yelp, decided to give Glass Magick a call.  I am SO GLAD I did!!    Everything from the booking process and speaking to Dawna (the owner) was fabulous.  She even gave me helpful insight about the area over the phone.  She's from Boston originally but definitely has that Southern hospitality thing down pat. :)   Initially we were scheduled for RC, however, he was unable to accommodate us and Patty stepped up to the plate.  And holy moly was she accurate.  All 3 of us had a reading and it was truly astonishing.  She asked only my name, birthdate and proceeded with a cold reading followed by cards. You are able to record the session which was nice. Without going into the specifics of the reading itself, it was so spot on, that each of us left with our heads spinning a bit.  Even the 'non-believer' of the group who just participated for fun.  In fact, he still can't quite make sense of the accuracy in the details. The conclusion must be that she clearly has a gift.     The shop itself is unique & homey with her efforts largely dedicated to showcasing local artists.  Dawna is down to earth and clearly loves what she does which was/is refreshing.  I am already planning my trip back to New Orleans to see all the things I couldn't squeeze in and Glass Magick will definitely be on the 'do-again's' list.  A big thank you from Heather, Clint & Cynthia to Dawna and Patty for an amazing experience.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 5.0
"I scheduled myself a mani and gel removal during my lunch break.    I arrived a little late, but they took me anyway.  I was asked if I wanted coffee, water, or tea and asked if they could take my jacket.  I gave them my jacket and asked for water.  The jacket was hung up in the closet and the water was cool and refreshing and delivered in a shrub glass.  Very nice.    Everyone was dressed respectably, with their make-up and hair done in a nice, but trendy way.  This matched the decor and ambiance and I was very smitten with it.  My nail technician removed the last bits of a gel manicure that I had gotten weeks ago, and although she asked if I wanted another, she did not push when I said no.   I chose two colors - a nice purple and purple mix glitter to go on top of it.    Then things started to get weird.  She asked me to prepay for the service, so that I ""wouldn't have to fumble with my purse"".  Okay.  I did so.  I was surprised (in a good way) that the services cost $20 LESS than I was expecting.  I sat back down and she asked if I had a jacket.  When I said yes, she got it for me and helped me put it on.  It was a chilly day, so I had a wool coat - which was rather warm for the comfortable little salon.    She gave me a TERRIFIC hand massage, the conversation was lovely, and my nails look GREAT.    When it came time for my nails to dry, she asked when I needed to be back to work by.  I had 15 minutes to go.  At that point, she got up and walked away.  She hung out with a few of the other people in the salon - in the back and at the reception area.  I waited for 10 minutes, blowing on my nails to get them to dry faster - and hoping she would come back and touch test them for tackiness.  At 5 minutes until I had to be back at work, she got up and went outside with 2 other girls, and walked out of view of the window.  Had she left?  Well, if she wasn't there any more there was certainly no point to my being there.    When I walked out of the salon, I saw her there on a smoke break with the other girls.  She said good bye and wished me a good time at the event I'm going to.  I made it back to work on time.    It's hard to review this.  The service, until the end, was amazingly good.  The service performed was also good.  But, the end was bizzare.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 3.0
"I thought ice cream sounded good tonight, so I headed on over to Friendly's.  I was craving the Mint Cookie Crunch sundae.  I go in there, and ask for the sundae to go, and they tell me they're all out of Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream.  I say OK, and then look at the other sundaes, and decide on Forbidden Fudge Brownie.  First things first, the people who ordered behind me got their sundaes before I got mine, so I had to wait longer. Then, I barely overheard the staff talking about how ""we're all out of ____"" ""are you kidding me??"" etc. So I'm still waiting on my sundae, finally they start making it and bag it up and give it to me to go home.  I get home, open up my sundae and start eating, and, here's the kicker, there were no brownies in it!!!! Wow, such great service. Instead of brownies, they gave me stale vanilla cake pieces.  They did this without asking me first.  If they had told me they didn't have brownies, I would have told them to make me a different sundae. But instead, they chose to put these nasty cake pieces into my sundae. And this isn't the first time I've been there where they were mysteriously ""out of this"" and ""out of that"". I was there a few months ago and they were out of ketchup. I mean, seriously? You're a restaurant whose main staple food is chicken tenders and fries, and you don't have ketchup?  And the list goes on and on. I've been coming to this friendly's since I was probably 10 years old and now I plan on never returning. Horrible customer service, nasty food, nasty people.

"I'm sad to give this place three stars but our experience was just Ok. It was SO dark in here and our first table was so wobbly. We moved to a different table and that one was wobbly as well-- so we stuck a napkin under one of the legs, down deal. I ordered the Cajun pasta which had great flavor but was soooo heavy. Our loaded fries with crawfish wasn't bad. My bf ordered a trio -- sampler and they basically had the same flavors to me. The oysters were ordered had a funky after taste.  Maybe it was just an off day and I'm willing to give it another try -- when in NOLA.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Went to the restaurant on a Friday night and surprisingly, the restaurant was not busy at all. I ordered a roasted veggie taco expecting a whole array of roasted vegetables. When my dish arrived it was literally roasted corn, zucchini, and black beans. The menu stated it was supposed to come with queso fresco but I did not see that on my taco. The filling came atop of the grilled tortillas and it looked like the 4 spoons of the filling on each tortilla. oaf you go to this restaurant please do not order this taco, you will be disappointed. However something I liked was that at the end of dinner there was a live band that came to play and even played us a song.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

I responded that I certainly wasn't going to get in a fist fight about pizza, of all stupid things. Waiting for TPD to show up so I can file a report about his wandering aggressive hands. Oh, he also told me that the pizza looked like it was from my wife's vagina, which I'll have you know is immaculate. Irony being that the pizza was actually from his oven. Yeah...

"This place sucked. Really. We went there this past Saturday so I could see Death Cab for Cutie(for my 3rd time--first two were at Mesa Ampitheatre, which is fabulous)...  there was tons of traffic, and we couldn't figure out why, since the doors had opened about an hour and a half before we got there...and then, once we got into the Convention Center, we figured out why--the TCC is divided into different halls. the first arena-area we came to had a hockey game about to begin...so we had to walk alllll the way around the building to find the 'exhibition hall' where the concert was being held.  so...we head in, and it's a GIANT GYMNASIUM with NO acoustics whatsoever! it was especially mind-numbing during the opening band(Cold War Kids?), because they sucked to begin with, and when you added the sound of their crap bouncing off the back(cinderblock) wall, it was just torture.  on top of everything, if you wanted a drink or two, you had to stand in a series of (1/2 hour long--literally) lines, and then stay behind a barrier of folding tables(about 300 ft from the stage) until your drink was downed.  total BS.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 1.0

"FYI: Their happy hour is from 5:00 - 6:30PM, and they get really busy really quickly.  As context, we came here during happy hour. So this review isn't for their main dining menu. (My fiancé went during main dining hours, see below)  WHAT WE GOT: Tacos (steak, chicken, fish, cheese), empanadas, nachitos with vegetable salsa  PROS: Well definitely the price of their happy hour menu for one. All tacos are $1 and their small appetizer plates are $2-$3 depending on what you get. In this case for us, the empanadas were $2 and the nachitos were $3. The tacos tasted pretty average, nothing super special so I guess you get what you pay for. The star of the show was probably the margarita I got. First of all, it was $5. Second of all, it was cantaloupe mint flavored. Oh my gosh it was fantastic. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Also the wait staff were all super friendly and helpful. They misheard one of our orders and brought us the nachitos by accident (we didn't originally order it) so our waiter gave it to us on the house.   CONS: Lets put it this way, happy hour is hectic. And it shows in the food. The taco shells were flaccid and cold and the meat in the tacos were dry. But you could get lucky and get a freshly made taco, in which case they end up tasting a lot better. The empanadas were also 90% fried dough and 10% filling so basically I couldn't taste anything more than the skin.   FIANCÉ'S CORNER: Their main dining hours has much higher quality food. Went with a friend, got the nachos ($12) and we each got an order of tacos (3 tacos, $8-10). Nachos are in very large portions, very tasty and good. Tacos are a bit pricey but outside of happy hour, the quality is much better and honestly pretty worth it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Ahh, the memories of Berkeley and all of the different stores and people. I grew up in Oakland, but spent alot of time in berkeley. The Yellow Submarine reminds me of days gone by. It is like walking into a time machine. The store is located in the scolaris center off pyramid. There is aout 5 tables inside and one outside. The sandwich shop is decorated very funky, with alot of stuff on the walls and old video games.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The girl that helped me had multiple piercings , tattoos and green hair. Reminded me so much of  Berkeley.  I ordered the salami and provolone on white roll.  You can choose what you want on it. From tomatoes to onions,lettuce,mustard  and mayo. The bread is extremely fresh and not doughy.  The one thing that really separates them from other shops, they sprinkle parmasean On the roll.

"For some students, Dirtbags was ""a part of growing up."" For me, it was always Bob Dobbs. More often than not, a stop here would work it's way into whatever festivities we had planned: taking in a basketball game, grabbing a bite after a concert, or just meeting up for a good time. Finals week was usually officially wrapped up with a visit here. This was the place to go when we needed to decompress. Many a bachelorette party seemed to find it's way here as well.   A couple decades later, and not much has changed. About once a month, our lab would meet here for lab meetings or once again, to decompress after a big grant had been sent out. Back in the day, when my now husband was still courting me, he wrote  our names on the wall with a purple sharpie, complete with a heart and arrow. And we'd still find ourselves wandering over at times to watch a game and have a beer.   Bob Dobbs is nothing fancy. The seating is comprised mostly of picnic tables with decades of graffiti carved into them, and the walls are still adorned with names, poems, mottos, you name it, in sharpie or whatever writing instrument they have on hand. Ive seen people bring kids here on occasion, but I personally don't view this place a family appropriate - some of the limericks scribbled on the walls are a bit raunchy. The raunch is taken to a whole new level in the restrooms, so again, know before you go (so to speak).   As for the food - in all my years coming here, I've only has three things: the Bob burger, the french fries, and the fried clams. I love how they season the burgers, with lots of garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and soy sauce. It's served on a big challah bun with choice of cheese (I get the smoked mozzarella), crisp lettuce, tomato, and a pickle. The fries are hand cut and maybe a nice accompaniment to the burger. And this may be nostalgia talking, but I do love the clams, and the cocktail sauce seems always to have perfect amount of horseradish. Now that I have kids, I don't get many opportunities to dine in, so when a craving hits I'll take my food to go (as a result, my kids have all become fans of Bob Dobbs takeout).   I find the service generally competent, but no nonsense. If bubbly enthusiasm in restaurant staff is your thing, you'll be sorely disappointed with your experience here. Bartenders and serves are affable and attentive, but they only get chummy with the regulars - and there are definitely a lot of regulars here. That said, newbies are certainly welcome, and tipping will go a long ways towards earning their endearment.   When you're looking for a low-key neighborhood bar experience, Bob Dobbs is your place.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0

"I found this place by Yelping highest rated near my work, but people had their doubts because of fear of the unknown. Up to this moment, Sweet Lucy's had the best ribs I've ever had to give you a frame of reference.  We called ahead for a large pickup order for a birthday luncheon. It was actually for my birthday lunch so that's the only reason we went here. It was a large order that was almost ready as we got there. Luther came out front with a small plate of ribs for us to try. I felt like Frank Underwood in that split second wanting to make friends with my own ""Freddie.""  I've never had ribs that fell off the bone that fast and that sauce was to die for. That's the moment I regretted ordered half a chicken. The chicken was great, but it wasn't Luther's pork ribs. He asked if I eat pork assuming I might've been in the pen and recently converted. It was flattering. Luther and his staff were so kind and generous by hooking us up with two free 2L of soda since our order was so large and I paid with cash. Please don't let small businesses take the brunt of credit card fees. My only knock was that they didn't have cornbread today, but that's because we picked up literally a half hour after they opened. Everyone loved the sides such as collard greens, Mac & cheese. Save getting their biscuits as they are simply rolls.

(we waited for awhile, so i didn't want them to have to correct their mistake and wait longer) it sucked... doesn't even taste like hu tieu.  it was bland..very very bland i mean if they called it some other thing besides hu tieu it would have been okay..  like just some regular noodle soup..but they called it hu tieu..and I was expecting some hu tieu flavoring.  and i still want my egg noddles... =(  i'll probably visit again.. but i'm not having any hu tieu here.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"(From sometime in august 2012)  Sooo on a trip to PA (from NYC), I decided my pink & white nails weren't worth keeping.. so I went for a soak off ($5) and manicure ($12).  Mimi's sister (didn't catch her name) did my nails and she did a great job! She was always gentle and checked in on me time to time if what she was doing wasn't hurting me. My cuticles don't look narly any more, paint job was perfect, shaped nicely, had a few extras I wasn't used to in ny (ie pH balacing prior to base coat, fast dry spray thing at the end, sugar hand scrub). Overall great manicure for super good price. Never had a soak off before but $5 is a steal and I know it.   I took a look at the price list.. and ACTUALLY their prices (besides mani/pedI) are better than the cheapest place I've found in Queens, NY (and I look hard).  I get away with $15 mani/pedi in NY (hence not being used to manicure extras lmao).  I hate giving a nail salons 5 stars, or.. even 4... but this has been deserved for the quality of the job and the experience.  Mimi was very nice to recommend some places to eat, chat and get to know us, and showed us to a local place to grab a little to eat before our journey home. I was looking for a salon to meet those basic manicure needs but instead my boyfriend and I got a weirdly cool and fun but random experience that made this trip even more awesome.  Neighborhood was questionable, but like others said, worth the travel. Easy parking.  PS They moved!

"Hate to give this such a low review, but this was such a disappointment!  We had heard such wonderful reviews... Oh, well. This place is more pretention than perfection. The service was nice and attentive. The ambiance was okay. The food was horrific, and I'm not just talking about the prices, because we didn't have to pay for this meal!  The ingredients were bottom feeders from the grocery store produce section. I'm not against using, for example, rutabaga or cabbage - if they're done well. Local food is worth trying to serve only if you can create a good product!  The food was so handled and manipulated that you had to wonder how many germs were in it.

"Horrible customer service. I haven't feel so bad entering at a store for a long time! This was my first and probably last time at this store, as I was visiting Santa Barbara over the weekend and the prospect of cute Japanese unnecessary but cheap goodies caught my attention. I entered and realized most thing were actually Made in China with the disguise of Japanese quality, but hell no. Still, cheap prices and cute designed lipstick packaging keep having me excited, especially the prices. I was confused to know which exact lipsticks were 99 cents vs higher prices and the girl who 'un-helped' me gave me the look. Very unfriendly face and attitude, literally she had the face of someone pissed and not enjoying her work. She told me for each item i had to go to the cash register and verify the price with her. When i told her that was not very convenient and practical she acted rude and told me like if i should know that they are 'changing the pricing system in the whole store'. I told her that seemed scan and misleading at least.   She left and I still was interested in getting some items. I went back to the cash register and of course the prices were much higher than announced. Another customer rep passed by and she helped me and honored those misleading prices. I told her I got a very bad impression of the store. She apologized and repeated the same story of the pricing system. Miniso: if you are changing pricing do that when customers are not at the store and do not lie to them. This store does not seem honest to me. Thanks to the second girl to honor the announced prices on shelf and way nicer attitude.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 1.0

"Worst most unprofessional stylist that work there today on Wednesday August  25th, I walked in to get my natural real hair braided and the girl told me to sit down then makes a phone call and tell me that she can't take out my braids so I then told her that I was just there the past 2 months and both the ladies took my braids out as expected then she was so quick to catch a rude attitude and she called the owner and the owner could not explain how I can get my hair rebraided so I said I ill go somewhere else and the girl said to me she didn't want to broad my hair anway then the owner told the girl to call the police on me  I will never be returning to this low level business ever again and I don't recommend it either because now noone can get there previous briads style taking out before getting a new hair style and they do not want to braid natural hair, they only rather the customers get extensions which actually damage the real hair and they call eachother to other salons.

"We hadn't been to Giuseppe's in years due to several less than desirable visits in the past with poorly executed pasta dishes (hard I know) and less than stellar service.  Well after four or five years we were in the area and at the very least one of the two issues has been fixed.  Seating was seat yourself as it was mid-afternoon on a Saturday with only three other tables occupied in the restaurant.  Even with that level of ""busy"" it still look quite some time for our drink order to be taken.  Eventually we got that squared away and ordered.  So far so good although we could have used a drink refill during the time we were waiting but of course you can't get a refill when your server does a David Copperfield until it was time for the food to come out.  The food itself was better than the past with one exception.  The children shared a personal pizza which was more than enough for them and it was solid.  My baked penne was very good with a lot of cheese and temperature wise it was perfectly ready to eat as soon as it hit the table so A+ on that one.  The lovely wife ordered vegetable lasagna yet of course they brought out regular lasagna instead.  Our server was less than apologetic about either her mistake or the kitchen's mistake and while she offered to correct the mistake for the actual dish ordered, she said it would be a twenty plus minute wait.  No thanks, we'll make due.  I must say that the quality of the food was much better than I remembered it from years past and the prices are not crazy considering the area that you're in but the service still leaves a lot to be desired as seemingly everyone likes to hang out at the front counter and talk versus actually checking in on tables in a timely manner.     We'll never be a regular here but I suppose every so often might be good enough.

I asked a question about a menu item and got a dead on the inside response. I then get sweet tea to drink which was handed to me without speaking. ""Famous sweet tea"" as it stated on the cup was far from it. It tastes like watered down instant tea ran through a dirty sock.  I then had to wait about 15 minutes for food which was old tasted like it was made yesterday and pulled out of the trash.

"This is the only place I've ever had a successful haircut!  You would think by how cheap it is it would be crappy but this is the only place I will ever go now.    I've been a customer here for about 15 years.  I always had my simple hair cuts done here as a kid, and when I got older and started wanting more elaborate styles I ventured out to other places and salons where I've paid over $100 for my hair to be done.  I have never been satisfied at any of those other places.  Far from it actually... I've had the most HORRIBLE haircut butcherings of all time at the most expensive places in Reno!  I have a theory now, that the cheaper the place the better the haircut :)  Because I've also gone to places like Super Cuts and they have also done a better job than the esteemed salons I have been to.   I had always gone to Happy Looker a month or so after I had my hair cut at other places so that they could even it out and do the best they could to fix it without making it too short.  Then I decided, why not just go to Happy Looker in the first place?  And its been smooth sailing since then.    The owner's wife (can't remember her name but she is almost always there during the day) is the only person who has been able to razor my hair and make a nice even transition at the ends - not choppy at all.  And just this past week I had my hair cut and I described sort of what I wanted in terms of layering and face framing in the front and the lady (also can't remember her name) did it perfectly.  And this last time it was only $14.  I had my entire head of hair cut for under $20 and I couldnt have asked for a better look.    I don't know, maybe I just have really bad luck at other places getting my hair cut, but after enough times I know I will always be happy with what they do at Happy Looker.  There are going to be girls out there who will think I am crazy to say that this place that advertises trims at only $8 is better than any salon in Reno, but that's seriously how my luck has gone for me!  I'm not saying you should change your trusted stylist, but if you are like me maybe you should give this place a try :)",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 5.0

Everything looks sleek and high tech, but the selection of products could be so much better. I walked in not looking for anything in particular and ended up spending good forty minutes in the store. Presently, I am slowly but surely getting ready to purchase new digital camera, and at the Sony store I found myself engaged in a long and interesting conversation about cameras with one of the sales associates. He showed me Sony cameras, explained about their features, even snapped some pictures, and then we began a long talk about what constitutes good camera. As I was chatting away, my husband stood nearby, drooled over 50"" plasma TV. Actually, the biggest chunk of Sony Style's floor space is devoted to TVs and blue ray/DVD players. The picture quality on the majority of TVs is amazing! I especially liked one of the Bravia eco series TVs.

"Everything I said to my prior review and more. I've been wanting to try Southern style chicken and waffles for a long time. I searched through and through. All of a sudden, a Yelper points out to me that The Duck offers them on Sundays. Oh, The Duck! I had been here before, and thoroughly enjoyed my food. Why not have at it again?  Brunch is 10-3 on Sundays (it's recently been changed). They offer a different menu with an interesting choice of specials (if I wasn't mistaken, I believe I saw what looked like Fruity Pebbles cooked into French Toast going to someone's table). I skipped the specials because I knew what I was there for. While I was at it, I went for the General Tso Wings for an appetizer, because...why the hell not? Wings sounded great at 10am. A cup of coffee also accompanied my meal.   As I waited for my food, I did see that the place fills up QUICK. We even got there a few minutes before they opened, and there were people already waiting to get in. It's a small space. It's cozy. You will have a table 2 inches from yours, but it's fine. You'll be so focused on your food that it won't even matter. I suggest you make a reservation, which they gladly take, or just get there early.   The Rivals Bros coffee was delicious. It's $3.00 a cup, but the cups are pretty big with welcomed refills. My wings had such a beautiful presentation that I didn't even want to touch them. They were FANTASTIC. It was $6.00 for 6 very large wings that were tender and bursting with flavor. I could have eaten that side of wasabi blue cheese with a spoon. It was smashing. I would have been fine with coffee and wings alone. Shortly after came out the chicken and waffles. I actually really loved that it wasn't drowning in syrup (though if you're a syrup lover, you will want more-- they use it sparingly). The waffle was good. The chicken....that chicken was so great. It had been a very long time since I had eaten a piece of fried chicken, and it was worth eating. How you're able to get the outside so deliciously crispy while retaining the moisture within is behind me, but I was certainly pleased.   The guy that runs the place (I'm only assuming he runs the place) is really friendly. He treats everyone like he knows them, which is super dope. The waitress we had this morning was sweet (something that fell short the last time I had been here...but the food was so good the first time that I didn't give a shit how grumpy my server was). Today though, it was all good. Yes, the hostess isn't the happiest person in the world, but who cares? My bill came out to around $32 (I was with someone else who had also ordered a coffee, as well as the chicken and waffles). Left the waitress a really heavy tip and practically rolled out the joint. I was stuffed.   I can't wait to to do it again.  I also vote that you leave the hip hop on, but that's just my opinion. =P   Keep up the good work, guys. Please don't get so cool that you have to relocate downtown. I like having a place with truly awesome food so close to home.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Ahhh! This review is long time coming. I've been several times now, all for pedicures and this spa does not disappoint, twice I was seated immediately, and soaked for just a few minutes, and couple of other times, I had to soak about 15-20 minutes until a tech got to me, but who cares...it's comfortable and relaxing! The salon is clean, open and roomy, well ventilation, good lighting, soft music, muted tv's in the corner, nice working massage chairs, you are offered a drink...coke, wine, water etc. And the pedicure...I always get the deluxe package ( about $34) , and it's nothing less then wonderful! Nice pedicure, and never hurried -- my feet and legs get massaged and gently scrubbed. They also use hot rocks as an added massage and put warm wraps on legs while my toes are painted! The techs are quiet but friendly and sweet...the energy is good. And they don't talk to each other in their native language like other salons do, which can be a little uncomfortable. Once Cathy noticed that my thigh was a bit sore, from a sports injury and she brought me an extra warm wrap! I can't say enough about this place -- it's all good!

"Ming's is okay, not a place I would go out the way for. One thing they take pride in is that they use quality ingredients, I'll give them some points for that. But my overall experience here wasn't enjoyable. The server was kind of abrasive, not too friendly.   My party ordered General Tso's, Lo Mein, and Crab Rangoon. The food was alright we were looking for a place that served the Tso's nice and crunchy, the pictures looked phenomenal, but the chicken came out moist and soggy on the outside.   One thing that really bothered me is that they introduced a totally different noodle in their lo mein. Typically you'll find egg noodles, or thicker variations, but at Ming's they use angel hair pasta. I'd let it go if they used mi, but angel hair pasta doesn't belong with this dish.   The crab rangoon is good, but as far as the sweet and sour sauce Ming's uses the cheap stuff. If y'all take a trip to Hong Kong Super Market you can get the good stuff for less than $5 a bottle.

"This is the worst boutique ever. I had the worse bridal experience. Megan, the owner, ordered the wrong size dress for me. She even saw me in the dress and said that it was perfect. When I got the dress in, THEIR seamstress said that there must've been a huge mistake and the dress should've NEVER been ordered in this size for someone like me. I was so humiliated and became super body conscious for no reason except for the fact that they ordered the wrong size. I was told that this was my fault because I was ""so happy"" when I first tried it on. Well duh... I loved the dress. I spent so much time in front of the seamstresses mirror crying because of how terrible I felt because I just couldn't fit. I felt like this was all my fault but it wasn't. But the thing is...  I don't know a thing about fittings or seamstressing. THAT IS YOUR JOB MELINDY ELENE. Your customers should not have to be experts in order to get the right dress. Both me and the steamstress confronted Megan, the owner, about the problem. Megan came up with the solution to tear apart the dress in order for it to fit me. Megan even said that there was a seam that they could let out. THERE WAS NO SEAM. There was nothing to let out. Not even an inch. If you were good at your job you would've seen that aspect right off the bat. At least know your dresses. Now I'm stuck with a $3,000 dress that I will never wear. She wouldn't even return it for a bigger size. She blamed the dress designer for it being a funky fit. Who does that??? DONT TRASH YOUR PRODUCTS. I contacted Ms. Anna Campbell, the dress designer, and they were appalled at this behavior. They sent me curiosity gift to make up for what a horrific experience I had. And the worst of all... It was the only thing my father bought for me for my wedding and now I cannot even touch it. It's just such a sad reminder that I will probably never be a super model. Body shaming is a real thing and it hurts. Please take your bride and run. She deserves better. She doesn't need to feel fat and stupid.

"Some of the best food I have ever ate. Definitely a most try. We started off with crab cakes, gator bites, and gumbo for appetizers. The grilled gator bites was seasoned perfect and tasted great. The rue in the gumbo set it apart from any I have tasted up to this point. Everyone else in my part of 8 seemed to love the crab cake. They were just alright to me. Then everyone ordered something different to be able to share family style but was way to much food for us.  Taste of New Orleans - red beans and rice and étouffée was mouth watering good  Fried Shrimp Platter- I don't like fried shrimp so it was just alright to me but rest of group loved it.  Redfish Oceana- cooked to perfection. The meat was flaky and good plus the butter shrimp sauce that put on top was good. The cornbread stuffing and turnip greens were good.  Jambalaya Pasta- had a slight hint of spice that was good.  Shrimp fettuccine- didn't taste the fettuccines.  Chicken fettuccine- didn't taste fettuccines  Mardi Gras Pasta- favorite by far of all the pastas",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"This review is for the Enterprise facility that's located in the Indianapolis airport.    Yep, yet another typical Enterprise experience:  Upsell!  Upsell!  Upsell!    I don't need anything beyond the car I rented -- and I especially don't need any redundant insurance, unless I'm absolutely certain that this trip is going to take me over The Bridges of Hazzard County or to several distilleries.    What I've reserved is what I want, and then I want to get to wherever I need to go.  Ah, yes... that insurance.  I don't need is some guy asking ""do you want basic or full insurance""?  Buddy, *no* insurance.  I got the GEICO gecko making good for my poor decisions, and a credit card that covers for any remaining wreckage from poorly-executed handbraking.  Oh, and you don't need to know my insurance deductible, and you don't need to remind me that the car has ""no insurance"" for the 3rd time as I'm driving away.  What I also don't need is some guy making it sounds like I'd be big pimpin' upgrading to a larger Nissan by referring to my intermediate car as ""small.""  Read the reservation.  I'm not ballin' in Indy and therefore have no need 2b rollin hard on 17's in an Altima, yo.  What I do need is a car that gets cleaned on the inside occasionally.  Pry the mystery crust off the passenger seat and bulldoze the dust from the dash, and maybe I'll personally recognize your effort by sliding you the 75 cents in commission you would have got had I submitted to your upsell pitches.  The complimentary bottle of water at the counter saved Enterprise from the depths of one-stardom -- plus the fact that at this airport (which is impressive and new) I can actually walk to the rental cars without having to wait to take some short-bus around the block.    I have a corporate plan with Enterprise, which in addition to getting me a jaw-dropping 5% discount is supposed to get my impatient ass outta any airport fast.

"I am on the fence about the number of stars, because inherently it's not a bad place, it's just not the place for me. I've been a few times because its my friend's favorite spot....but all in all there's nothing pulling me back to this place.   It comes off, to me, as slightly pretentious and unwelcoming. It can also get very loud and cramped, which is odd to me because it comes off very retauranty, almost like they're grudgingly acting as a bar. The food is just decent and I've had a few cocktails that were just decent, but I've also been scolded by a waitress for my chair placement (no combining tables) and seen the bartender sneering and rolling his eyes at my rather large and in charge group of drinking lawyers.

"One of my fav hidden gems!  I visited this place more than once. No complaints. I am finalist with the bathhouses/jimjilbangs (spelling?) in South Korea, so when I came across this one, I was excited to check it out. Easy check in, you get your locker, towels and uniform from the front desk. The wet area is a little smaller than I am used to, but the hot and cold tubs are still fine. I would love to return and get a body scrub/massage! They really are amazing! There are showers, sinks, free drinking water, a vanity area to do your hair and makeup if desired as well as a scale if you're bold enough to check.  In the coed areas, you'll find the dry saunas--one has pink Himalayan salt (I believe) and the other, clay. There is also a small pool area, common area with a TV and quiet area if you want to nap. I did not make it a point to order food from the restaurant inside. Perhaps next time.  If you need a place to unwind and relax, alone or with someone else, this is a great place to try as long as you are not uncomfortable being naked or being around other naked individuals of the same sex.

"Today I was a bit disappointed in Noire Nails.    My feeling is if you do not have enough nail tech do not direct them​ to the work area.  I came for a pedicure and was asked to soak my feet.  They asked the two ladies across to also soak their​ feet.  The daughter had a nail tech but, ​mom soaked her feet like me​​.  Two more women came in and were directed to the work area.  They were directly given service.  Each pedicure takes about 30-45 min--so the 15 min I had already been soaking could turn into a 45 min. visit.    I thought at this point a bit of communication would have been nice.  They could have had appointments but, they would have known this before I soaked my feet.  I asked for a towel--dried my feet--put my shoes back on and quietly left.  The thing about nail places there are  so many of them in Tampa.  I left to go find another one.

"This rating is heartfelt with one caveat: if you want to experience the wonder that is Chef, be prepared to pay. Some of his newer creations are priced as high as $20-$22 per maki. Still, even on my modest budget, as infrequently as I am able to go there, after my first visit Temaki became almost exclusively my place for sushi.   Chef Aki is, in the true sense of that word, an artist. To immerse yourself fully in his art, sit at the bar and give yourself up to his improvisation: forget the menu and let him make what he will. Let him create. I have never encountered a sushi chef so bold in his use of sweets and sours -- fruits, berries, sauces... Yet he never loses grasp of the delicate balance among tastes and textures. Just the right fish with just the right leaf. His rolls unfold in your mouth in layer upon layer of flavors -- in triumphant discoveries or in gentle surprise, in bursts of fireworks or in a tender brush of a velvet paw. For an adventure, don't ask Chef what's coming next.  If you prefer to know what you're eating, though, take a look at the menu, and you'll see what I mean. On my first visit, before I knew to give up control to the Master, I ordered two special rolls and never thought of sushi as I had before. Each piece of the Deluxe Roll is like a dawn ascent to a mountain top, starting in slow twilight, then waking you up unexpectedly with deep breaths of all-permeating fresh air, and suddenly culminating with a shock of sunrise -- most stunning, reigning above all things human and not, having changed every color and line -- and you stop chewing and sit for a moment just wrapping your mind around this profoundly new experience of light hidden in taste. And then, Tuna Tuna brings you back down. It is a calm hug of a roll, with a bit of crunchy potatoes over soft, slightly warm tuna, spiced just right for the utmost comfort. I am from Russia, and yet this Japanese tuna roll tasted to me like home itself. It was like a warm hearth at the heart of a log cabin, evening setting beyond the windows into the still-glowing snow. It was an embrace of a quilt, safety of familiar things. I closed my eyes when I ate it, and I didn't want to open them.  I've never seen Temaki very crowded, but Chef is the only chef, and they do take-out and delivery, too, so the service may not always be fast. If I wait, I sip tea or sake and watch him work. There is little better entertainment than watching a master at work.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"This wonderful store is Philly's Dean and DeLuca.  An oustanding gourmet market with nice selection of gourmet items and pleasing shopping atmosphere. Customer service was friendly and knowlegeable. The highlights would be the cheese selection along with the meat and seafood sections.

If you love cheese this is the place for you if you visit or live in the Philly area.   Like Dean and DeLuca its very expensive but then again most foodies including myself would say you get what you pay for when comes to quality food items. Top notch ingredients and products will always cost more unless you are buying from a local farmer's market.

"Visited this place for the first time on mothers day.  Worst food and service ever. Our waitress was horrible, not sure she really knew what she was doing.  The appetizers took almost 40 min to come out.  All we ordered was a sampler of fried food and a basket of French fries which take 7 min in a fryer ( I should know I work in food service) The dining room was empty...we were one of three tables. We were waiting for friends to show up so It wasn't a big deal but then it was time to order.  They were out of salad...really? out of salad?  They also were out of the mixed veggie for a side too?  Our food finally came out and yuck!  the salmon looked like the fish you get on a Chinese buffet and had no taste.  I had a French dip kind of sandwich.  It was tasteless and I just picked it apart. The boneless chicken tenders were covered in salt.  The roll on my husband's sandwich was on was soggy and gross.  Not to mention nothing was hot.  It must have sat in the window for too long.  My daughter liked her Kobe beef burger...1 out of 7 is a plus right? bill was 150 or so...far too expensive considering no one finished their food or liked it for that matter.  Then to tip a non existent waitress?  Being a server myself I couldn't leave without leaving 15% but It killed me to do it.  No manager in sight to even complain to so we didn't say a work.

The food, the service,  the atmosphere....it's just ""ok.""  A sit down dinner should be an experience that through food and friends becomes a memory. I can't recall what I had to eat the first 2 times here and only remember that I had a bbq burger the last time because it was a week ago.

"BLAINE was our server and he was AMAZING!!! I never had to ""look"" for my server. I honestly made this review because I wanted to speak on the service. Yes, the food was great.... the cinnamon pecan bacon was DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!! ..... but the service .... my goodness.... I wish there was a ""Blaine"" in every restaurant I went to. Everything about him felt so genuine. He was kind, attentive, funny.... all of the above. I've been to many restaurants... and service like this is rare. He needs to be the one that trains new servers.... people like him will are the reasons customers will return over and over and over.

"Brittingham's (like the General Lafayette, one minute from my house) is a nice place to catch up for a drink on a low-key night. The beer selection is decent - in addition to having your standard fare on top, they also have an OK bottle selection with some creative picks.   The food is pretty good too. The menu is extensive, with food ranging from Irish specialties (corned beef and cabbage, shepherd's pie, etc.) through pastas and a cold sandwich/deli section. My only criticism is that it feels like they stop serving food kind of early sometimes - especially on Sundays.  The staff is always very nice and they always remember my wife and me when we stop in to visit. Pete the bartender is pretty cool.  On occasion, we even order take out from Brittingham's, which is always quick and good.  Would definitely recommend stopping by Brittingham's.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"First off, I went there with my two kids thinking they would be off the chain and therefore prevent me from buying anything.  Boy was I wrong.  I had been researching the hell outta folding bikes and there were basically 2 shops in the Philly area that carried them, PHEW and some shop around 2nd Street.  I hate driving downtown and I knew I would be dragging the little kiddos along so I chose this place.    Originally, I had stopped at a couple of bike shops in my area, but they were trying to talk me out of buying a folder (and that just wasn't cool); then the one place was like, ""Yeah, if you wanna come back and give some bikes a test ride..."" (because I had my kids) which seemed fine at the time until after I visited PHEW, which will be explained in a min.    I wanted a folder because I have no outside storage, there's steps to get into my little twin home, we have limited storage space inside as we are a family of 5, and I wanted to be able to throw the bike, the trailer, and the kids in the SUV and go to whatever (paved) trails we want.  If I did get a hybrid or mountain bike, it would need to be left outside and I didn't want to drop a bunch of money on a bike if I was just going to leave it out for the elements to destroy.  Anywaaaay, so I got to PHEW and parked right out front which was sweet because carting around these two is a job in itself (duh, mom).  I was greeted by Richard who was ever so sweet.  I told him what I was looking for and my budget and he grabbed several bikes for me to test ride.  He wasn't pushy (at all) and he was very willing to accommodate all my annoying questions and concerns.  While Richard was helping me, Meenal took my daughter, who's two, around on this little orange bike.  She (my daughter) was MAD when we left the store without it, but I so appreciated Meenal's diversionary tactics.  My son, who's one and hates everyone, took a liking to Afshin and they hung out on the sidewalk while I rode a couple of bikes down and back.  I ended up grabbing a folder which was way below budget but perfect because I didn't really wanna spend that much money anyway! The staff was amazing (obviously!) and I would recommend this place to ANYONE looking for a folding bike, or any bike for that matter.  The minute we got home we easily hooked up the trailer, because Afshin had the hitch cup installed for us at the shop, and went to Rita's to round out our nice little day.

Cheesecake Factory never disappoints. The food was delicious classic burger cooked to a perfect medium. The side salad left a little to be desired but my quibbling complaints are totally covered by the fantastic service provided by Jasmine. She was quick with fantastic recommendations. Even under her mask you could hear her smile and friendliness. I dine out regularly and also have spent the last 15 in fine dining as server sommelier and corporate trainer. Jasmine should be working at any of the nicer places in town. I'd get down to Cheesecake Factory and request Jasmine as your server.

"This is not about the Nashville office. They have always been great. It is Corporate. This company ranks right up there with Comcast and At&T for customer service. If I ran my business this way I would have NO customers. Reserved a car on line in June. Paid 89.00 deposit. Got to the place the next day. They said I needed to use my Credit Card. Cancelled that res and rent with a Credit Card. So I did. Asked when I would get my 89.00 deposit back. They said 7 to 10 days. That went by with no refund. Called, spoke to a woman in Web Help Desk (VERY RUDE PERSON) Said if I didn't rent another car then I would not get a refund. Then she looked up and said oh I see you did rent a car. It will be refunded in 7 to 10 days. Never happened. Called spoke to another woman who said well there was never a refund order entered.  So she said she would do it. It will take, you guessed it 7 to 10 days. Never happened. Spoke to a Customer service Manager who assured me it would be refunded in 7 to 10 days. Never Happened Called today. Was hung up on 4 times after speaking to a customer service rep who put me on hold and then sent me to the web desk who then saidd they would send me back and you guessed it HUNG ME UP. I am now at this point 1 hour in trying to get an answer. It's a matter of principle now. Finally got a lady in customer service, Marilyn, who said There must have never been an order for a refund put in because it shouldn't take over 3 days. REALLY??? Even a Manager didn't put that order in 12 days ago??? Who runs this place. SO She put the order in (so she said) and I said so I should have it by Friday. She said yes then she even said it takes up to 5 days. She then said you will have it but you can feel free to call us back if not????  This is how they make that extra money I'm sure. 7 to 10 days.  It will be a lot longer than that before I ever rent a car from these people! This company is unbelievable. Totally incompetent, and not customer service oriented.  Do yourself a favor...

"Top Golf is the place to go to for a nice night out with your friends. Top Golf offers an unique golfing experience. They are not your typical golfing place. For starters the have a full size bar as soon as you walk in. Which is perfect when you are waiting for your bay to open. I highly suggest that you make a reservation and go with a group of people, because your wallet will thank you for it. If you plan to go during the weekend, you should book your reservation a week advance because it fills up pretty quick. When you are planing your trip to Top Golf, your reservation fee will either be free, $25, or $50. The price depends on what day and time you plan on going. Now fast forward to 15 minutes before your reservation starts; you will receive a text message asking if you will be arriving on time. Once you receive that text, you need to text Yes back. After you do that, they will send you a message telling you that your bay is ready and which one it is.  Once you arrive to your bay; a server will greet you and explain how everything works from playing to drinking to eating. Their drinks are pretty good, but I have not tried their food yet. I heard its pretty good, and Im excited to go back to try it.  When it comes to the golfing, each game it a hour long, and you can extend it for how many hours you would like. Keep in mind each hour is between $40-$50 The game itself is pretty cool, and you can chose different games to play.  This is the place to go for a fun night out with your friends.

The drink service wait times were about 1 drink per hour and we were not allowed to get drinks from the bar ourselves, which surprised me as they must be losing a lot of money with that policy at $8-$10 per drink. When it came time to close out our drink tabs with the server, it seemed that everyone within earshot had the same problem: ALL of the tickets were incorrect.

The arugula salad was great too, with just the right amount of lemon vinaigrette dressing.  The quiche my partner got was delicious too, but a bit too eggy in my opinion. Would have been nice to have more filling (broccoli etc.).  I noticed the decoration inside the store had become more ornate... I liked how it used to be more simple and sophisticated. This time there were way too much pink and glittery butterflies and pigs and fairies...  A few other tiny things I couldn't help but notice- the pale pink necktie of one of the servers was quite dirty (ruins the otherwise very clean and pretty feel of the store overall), and the lady inside the counter (looked to be the owner or some kind of supervisory role) was frowning most of the time.

"This is where massage therapists would go - and why? Because Tucson Touch was founded by some of the best teachers from the now defunct Desert Institute of the Healing Arts...and they are extremely choosy about the therapists they take on.   My favorite therapist not only taught at DIHA and Cortiva, she taught massage at Pima Community College and at high end seminars in five star spas around the world - and she's taught acupuncture at the acupuncture school. She does this thing with moxa on the end of the needles for weight loss - and the whole experience is incredible. She actually removed a large mass on my foot with acupuncture, which I was previously told would have to be surgically removed! I was pretty skeptical about acupuncture - and I admit afraid of the needles. But they are thinner/finer than paper and not like other needles - not painful. I also questioned whether it would really work - seeing is believing. If she'll do it, I recommend a combination acupuncture/hot stone massage, the complete package!   Most massage spas offer similar services and a pleasant, calming atmosphere.

"5 stars in flavor for buttermilk pancakes with bacon or country ham only.   While I've had the country fried chicken with sides or chicken-and-dumplings and thought each meal was successful at the time, every time I eat pancakes at Cracker Barrel, I regret everything else I've ever eaten at Cracker Barrel. The edges are always crispy the centers are always fluffy. The server brings you a warmed individualized serving/bottle of maple syrup, sometimes two servings/bottles if you can make the psychic connection happen with that server. Any other meat than bacon or country ham (the latter of which has to be ordered as a side) is a mealy or rubbery mistake that you will rue. One star is knocked off, because we/you always have to wait, which is almost migraine-inducing with potpourri stink and bad country music din, as well as filled other crap you never want to buy.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 4.0
"No one I know wants to have a colonoscopy. But to be sure your body is cancer free and working well, you need one after celebrating birthday #50. Today is my consult with Dr. LaCamera for my 4th one in 18 years. The first one in 2003 was good, with no reason to see him for ten years. But two tumors in 2009 necessitated another colonoscopy in 2011. Those polyps put me on the 5 year plan. The third, in 2016, resulted in 3 undetermined polyps which put me on the 3 year schedule. I'm hoping that the next scheduled colonoscopy returns me to the 10 year schedule.   Dr. LaCamera is patient, kind, knowledgeable, and professional. My consultation with him is a back and forth of questions and answers - concerned and friendly. His staff mirrors his positive traits - always professional, patient, kind, friendly and knowledgeable. If I have to undergo this necessary procedure with it's cumbersome, unpleasant preparation the day before, at least I know that my surroundings and the people in those surroundings are wonderful & beyond reproach!",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 5.0

Food was absolutely great! I had the Wildcat Pupusa and my girlfriend had The Construction Burro. Both dishes were great! There coffee is ok nothing special. Vivian was our server and she was great very friendly and attentive despite them being very busy. I would have gave them 4.5 stars because of the slight confusion we had. When you get in you have to write down your name on the list and I thought they go by just whoever is next but I guess if you chose to sit outside or if it's only two of you they get priority which I understand but it wasn't made clear to me until I asked.

Went for dinner last night (Saturday) and I ordered the shrimp fra diavolo. The shrimp was a bit off in flavor and was also tough to cut through.

And I had the crab salad - which was good - simple enough for non-foodie me and the crab was very fresh tasting and that's all that counts with me.

"OMG what a pleasant surprise. Where to start?  1. Half-priced price breakfast for quality dishes that were already reasonably priced. I mean, come on! Only $5.50 for chicken fried steak with three eggs over easy and cooked just right. One of the best chicken fried steaks I have ever had.  2. An excellent, perfectly spiced (did not even add extra Tabasco and black pepper, which I ALWAYS do) Bloody Mary for only $5. It does not get any better than this.  3. Alex, our bartender/server being very friendly and most efficient. And those leather tops the girls wear are quite friendly on the eyes, to boot. When ordering from Alex, I had a momentary lapse of memory and said, ""Uh. Where's my brain?"" and then placed my order. A few minutes later, my girlfriend, Mary said something (why don't I remember?) and Alex quipped, ""I found your brain. It's sitting right next to you."" Absolutely hilarious and quick-witted, I highly recommend you sit in her section of the bar.  4. The modernized poker/keno/blackjack machines that actually have all of the buttons working.  5. The club card sign-up process. Hand the bartender your driver's license and within a couple of minutes you are presented with your card and provided with detailed instructions on how to use the interface to validate your new PIN and activate your card. The Biltmore (see two reviews back) could learn a thing or twenty from this place.  Thanks again, Alex. It was a true pleasure and great surprise to have a wonderful breakfast with such great service at such a reasonable price.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Best basement ever.   [I always describe this place as kind of like drinking in someone's basement: the decor is clean but weird, there's not a lot of ambiance, and the bartenders mostly remind you of someone's mom (friendly, not fancy, sometimes can't hear what you say, busy.) Food is plentiful and inexpensive. NB I never eat in the 'dining room' so this review is for the bar area only.]   The reason to go are all. the. beers! (which you'll find listed, with typos, on a probably-wet piece of paper with several crossed off. Again, Capone's is not fancy. It is comfy and super well stocked.)  So, first date place? Nah. 117th date place? Hell yes. Bring your kid, they won't mind. They'll probably slip her a few extra French fries and pat her on the head. And the old regulars sitting at the bar in T shirts and flannels will smile at you all.  Foodwise, everything is delicious and served in large portions. Nothing's super fancy (are you getting that yet?). Our favorites are the marvelous pork sandwich, which is served au jus, or the mussels.

"What an amazing experience.    First off, the staff that served our table (Natasha, Alex, and Jenni (?)) were such sweethearts.  Friendly, mindful, wonderfully enthusiastic, and good humored.  They truly brought the whole dining experience full circle for us.  Our amuse bouche:  The field beans (in the spoon) was our favorite.  Lots of flavor infused in plain ol' beans - tasted like smoked salmon.  Also loved the ""eggplant caviar"" on the crostini.  Soup:  We had the ""death by gumbo.""  Quail stuffed with all of your traditional gumbo ingredients with a piping hot roux broth poured tableside.  Highly recommend it.  Definitely shareable.  My husband and I split it and it was brought out already divided.  Cold appetizer:  Had the beef tartare.  It was okay - but nothing remarkable in our opinion.  Hot appetizer:  Ricotta gnocchi and lobster.  So decadent.  The gnocchi was light and airy unlike your traditional ones made of potato.  The lobster really took in the vanilla and tarragon broth - so fragrant and delicious.  Entrees:  My husband ordered the Seafood Bouillabaisse.  I had the Braised Short Ribs - so tender and fall apart at the touch.  Ribs came with a rutabaga and citrus purée which was a perfect complement to the meat.  The citrius was refreshing in light of such a rich meal.  Dessert:  Ordered the Turbodog Stout Chocolate Cake, which was delicious but wasn't much to it.  Before the cake came out, we were given a Coconut and Lime Semi-freddo - the flavors were refreshing and definitely cleansed the palate.  Mystery box:  Was brought out at the end of the meal.  A little gimmicky but the petite desserts were nevertheless a sweet treat at the end of the meal.  Our favorites of the lot:  lemon basil shortbread, chocolate truffle (the chocolate center oozed and melted in your mouth), and the nougat-like cookie (not sure what it was really called but it had nuts in it and tasted like nougat).  I would highly recommend RR.  :)",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 5.0
"We've visited Bern's twice in the past twelve months, and it is always amazing. Since my initial visit almost 2 years ago, I've learned a couple of things about this place:   1. If you like a server, request him or her when you make your reservation. Trebor (like Trevor but with a ""B"") is always great.  2. The chateaubriand is awesome. I had it for the first time on my last visit and I enjoyed it so much more than the filet.  3. I've learned the secret to the dessert room: GET THE ICE CREAM. The macadamia nut ice cream is truly the best ice cream I've had in my lifetime. I say this without hesitation or exaggeration. Get the macadamia nut sundae, served in an orange-scented cone with homemade hot fudge and whipped cream. It is big enough to share, but my dining partner refused to share with me and insisted on having his own. I can't blame him. That ice cream was the best part of my entire meal. Truly.   The only reason I give it 4 stars is that on my last visit, our service was a bit off. Our server was taking care of one large party after another, and the two of us couldn't compete with that. Typically the server walks you to the elevator on your way to the dessert room, but this time we were ignored over and over until we finally just took ourselves there. It seemed that the party of 10 was a bit more important than just the two of us, and that was a little difficult for me considering that we were also paying to be there. But overall, Bern's is always lovely.",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 4.0
"Ever had one of those dinners you really expected to be good and then were so disappointed that you wish you had just kept thinking it was a good place.  Nothing against Applebee's (although I do t eat there) when I say this, but Firebirds was like an expensive Applebee's...and I won't eat here again.  It was truly terrible.  Being gone out of the country for 10 days I decided to try the meatloaf - some comfort food.  It was warm-ish.  It didn't have enough gravy and I could find our server to get more, and they weren't busy.  The mashed potatoes were nearly cold and you could pick up the entire serving with your fork, as it was cemented together.  The green beans were the only thing good on my plate and the only thing actually hot-ish.  Nothing pains me more than to get a bill for a terrible experience.  Our initial server, Tristan I think was great, but then he was sent elsewhere.  I'm not sure how this place keeps open, but probably from the hotel business around.  Thanks but nob   Update: Ok, so tonight's experience was much more like what I anticipated the first time.  I stick by my first review, but tonight showed me what they can do!  Thank you!  I had the Chile rubbed Delmonico and loaded baked potato.  It was excellent!  My daughter and her friend both had Steak Frites.  They were part of the clean plate club.  Our server Julian was on it from start to finish.  Restoring my faith in the wait staff - at least Julian!  Thank you again.

"Sunday, May 28, 2017 - 7:30PM Dinner Seating: Table (Inside) Party: 3 Adults  Had a nice time getting some dinner with friends, and wanted somewhere quiet and relaxing to enjoy each other's company. The place was nice, but didn't really have anything special about it, or anything that really popped out as unique, but wasn't expecting anything extraordinary either.  CUSTOMER SERVICE = 4.5 Stars The guy who was our server was nice and attentive, and was always ready to answer any questions about the menu, or the drinks we ordered. Our server showed his personality (something I look for) rather than being a monotoned brick wall. Was really nice and even had some fun banter throughout the dinner.  FOOD = 3 Stars The food was more or less average. I got the Trio Fajitas (Grilled Chicken, Grilled Steak, & Prime Rib) and it tasted great, but was only given 4 small tortillas, which sadly wasn't really even, especially when having all the stuffings I did. The meat was seasoned well, but the steak was a little more chewy than I would had wanted. Also ordered the Presidente Margarita, and was severely disappointed. Last time I came here it was new on the menu and tasted awesome (stole it from my friend), but now they have it ""On Tap"" and it's not as great. My friend this time around, however, got the Vodka Rita, and it was amazing! Normally hate vodka, but it tasted like lemonade. That drink is deadly for sure!  ATMOSPHERE = 3 Stars Nice and calming, but when it comes to chain restaurant, there normally isn't anything extraordinary or special about the place. Was pretty average, they had some music in the background, but even with how empty the place was (maybe 5-7 other tables when we arrived), I had to strain to hear the music when a good song came on. However, the place was clean, and the food came out super fast (within 10 minutes of ordering).  FINAL THOUGHTS Overall, nice place to come to if you want a simple dinner, with a quiet and calming atmosphere. But if you're looking for a little more excitement, maybe go to a restaurant that isn't a chain. However, still had a good time thanks to the people I went with, the really nice (and good looking) server, and the speedy service!",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 3.0

(We tried both the red and white, not to sweet and very strong)  Wasn't so excited with: - Date with a Pig (The name is cute, but the portion was incredibly small and very greasy) - Blue Champion (Filet mignon medallions topped with chanterelle mushrooms, it was tiny for the price and the port reduction was a little overpowering)  The service was great, we had them split our bill in two so it was easier to manage and they kept it well organized (impressive).

She insisted the Mt Kamehameha had portobello mushroom in it. It never listed that in the menu though.

Laid back. Very friendly staff members. Excellent for young children... my two year old loved it, but I imagine that my 7 year old nephew would have been bored.  What I liked: We attended on an event day which I think added to the fun of this place.  I would definitely recommend going on a day that they host an event. I really liked the little amphitheater and Snow White show they performed. I also really liked that they had a lot of picnic space and that the park had a lot of shade.  The butterfly house had an attendant that was able to identify the different types of butterflies and even offered up sprigs of butterfly bush to visitors to lure butterflies.  What my daughter liked: The carousel, the water sprinklers, the butterfly house, the train ride & the Snow White show.

"I've been studying guitar with Ron for about 3 years now, so I am writing from experience.  My guitar lesson with Ron is one of the favorite parts of my week.  He combines a great level of technical teaching (chords, notes, scales, etc.) with plain old jamming, which makes for a fun lesson.  What I mean is that he doesn't overdo it with the traditional rote teaching methods like alot of instructors do - he puts aside time to just have fun, jam, and let loose on the guitar if you want (which I think is essential to building confidence).  He is also, hands down, the best blues guitarist you will find giving lessons in Philadelphia.  I only care to study blues, so I did alot of research before I chose him.  I have also seen him play country, rock, Spanish guitar, etc., and he is amazing in those areas as well if that is what you are looking for.  He has been playing guitar in many venues for decades, so you will not be disappointed with his skill level.  I highly recommend him.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 5.0

"If I had to sum up my review in one word: ""Inconsistent"".  The staff was friendly, but unpolished to the point of being clumsy.  The food was sometimes really good, sometimes not good at all.  The two of us had reservations at 5:30pm on a Friday, at which point only a handful of tables were seated.  Somehow they screwed our reservation up and had us sitting at a four top with a different couple.  Points to them for catching it before they sat us.  No points for not communicating to us that this was the reason we were delayed in being seated.  Instead, there were like five different employees standing in front of a computer trying to sort it out, not one of them mentioned to us what the issue was, I just cobbled it together over all the whispering.  At one point the manager actually pointed at us and asked the hostess if ""we were the couple"", while we were standing less than a foot away.  Really?  How about someone acknowledge our existence and, ya know, communicate a little?  The cocktails were...blah.  My partner's cocktail was supposed to be modeled after a Christmas cookie.  The staff indicated it was supposed to be a signature drink.  It tasted more like someone mixed vodka with milk and a little vanilla extract, and tossed on some sprinkles.  Very rough.  Our first course, two soups, came out before our bottle of wine.  This is a pet peeve of mine and should never, ever happen at a restaurant at this price point and purported level of service.   The two soups also showed up without.... soup spoons.  Or silverware of any kind.  The soups are poured at the table, and the waitress poured the soup TOWARDS my partner, not away from or parallel to.  Had there been any splashing, it would have gone into her shirt.  Poor form.  The waitress finally showed up with the wine, started opening it, and then some other guy (sommelier?  waiter?  we'd never seen him before) showed up seconds later with a second (different) bottle of wine, and asked us if we'd like to go ahead and open it.  Except we hadn't ordered a second bottle of wine.  Our entrees also managed to show up without silverware.  How is that even possible?  The food was... mostly good.  The soups (turtle soup and chicken and andouille gumbo were very nice.  My entree - beef braised in something or other - was more accurately described as ""beef cooked to a certain temperature in a liquid"", because it was brutally tough; not tender and completely dry.  My partner's duck was really nice though.  Cooked perfectly to medium rare and a wonderful combination of flavors and texture.  So, again, everyone was friendly and nice, but service seemed completely jumbled.  Food was anywhere from good to ok.  But do you really want to drop $250 on a bottle of wine, schizo service, and ok food?",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 2.0

"So, I been wanting to go here for awhile & today was the day.  On Friday, I saw a great deal with the restaurant on Facebook.  2 waffles, 2 eggs & a glass of Rose for $8.13 available for dine in & takeout.  I ordered 2 of the specials & the sweet potato pie to go.  I really like the sugar waffles which has sugar cubes inside the waffle which is top with some strawberries.  Eggs are eggs & nothing too special but it was good.  I only tasted the frozen Rose  because I'm driving around & it is very good.   The sweet potato pie was kinda different somewhat, it was a little lumpy.  I use to a smooth filling, it was good.  I really love the look & the music inside.  Very relaxing.

"I'm not sure what everyone else is used to, to be able to leave three stars or more for this hotel. I checked in after booking online through Hotels.com. Pictures of the rooms on the web seem fine, if not a little floral.   Staff were very perfectly curtious. The first room I was given, 313, was totally unacceptable. worn out carpet, damaged furniture that was straight from 1948, and stains all over the upholstery. definatly not acceptable, so I asked for a different room, which was in exactly the same condition. I returned to the desk yet again, and asked if all the rooms were in the same condition, and the lady said yes. I've stayed in hostels that are in better condition and cleaner in my youth.  I declined to stay there because of how dirty, stained, worn and dated the whole hotel is, and drove 2min away to the Marriott Courtyard, right next door. The room at the Marriot was $5 more a night, and exactly whatvI expect from a 3star plus.  Hotels.com were happy to refund my night's stay.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 1.0
The food was excellent and the music added a great ambiance.  The waitstaff was divided between seasoned veterans like Dennis and Anthony who were a whirlwind of smiling service and my waiter who seemed to spend most of his time chatting with in the middle of the restaurant or near the kitchen door.  He didn't take the hint when he was chatting in the middle of the room and one of the other waiters handed him a coffee pot to refill mugs.  Ask for Dennis or Anthony you won't be disappointed. The food was great but you had to order the omelets and eggs Benedict from the table and there wasn't carved roast beef.

"I have been going to Taqueria Corona for about 30 years. I absolutely love the food. The beans and rice are incredible with a little of their green salsa (or a lot, if you like it that way, which I do). The black beans are refried and have that wonderful black bean savory, almost smokey flavor. It pairs nicely with the yellow rice. Their rice is neither sticky, nor dry. So often, places can't get it right. The green salsa has enough heat from the jalapenos to make it interesting, as well as a bit of tartness that makes it work perfectly in concert with the beans and rice. I think the next favorite thing I've had there is the shrimp flauta. It has enough seasoning to remind you that your eating at a Mexican restaurant, but the spice doesn't overwhelm the shrimp. The shrimp taste fresh, and I have never had one of their flautas with rubbery shrimp. Along with the shrimp, there is just the right amount of cheese inside the rolled, flour tortilla. So good! Don't forget that they come with some pretty tasty guacamole, as well.  The atmosphere is typical Latinx cantina, so it creates the ambiance most of us have come to expect from this type of place. The service is generally pretty good, though they are often VERY busy, which means they don't come back to check on you as often as you might like. They make up for that by being extremely polite and solicitous when you do see them, and if you catch their eye, they get to you pretty quickly.  All-in-all, it is one of my favorite restaurants in the New Orleans area, and if you haven't tried it, do yourself a favor and go there!

"A classic New Orleans experience. We prefer lunch to dinner. Mr. B's salad instead of Gumbo YaYa, just because I knew barbecue shrimp was coming and the salad dressing is perfect. A $1.50 Bloody Mary that was well done. Informal yet meticulous service. When the shrimp comes, also comes the bib and the extra napkins. The combination of shrimp and sauce and bread for dipping is inspired. We come to New Orleans whenever we can, and we have been having lunch and brunch at Mr. B's for longer than I want to tell you. (They used to have a dish, Shrimp Chippewa, that left you feeling even more guilty than the barbecue shrimp. I asked the server how long it has been gone and he laughed and said they bring it back once a year. I guess for those of us whose arteries can take one morer shot) We very much look forward to our next trip to Mr. B's.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 5.0

When I made the appointment, I was promised an hour long pedicure for $40 (which was a little cheaper than other local day spa rates).  The most enjoyable part of the pedicure was the 10 minute soak, although the seat (which consisted of two pillows propped up on the wall) was terribly uncomfortable. I did not receive any form of foot massage, and Courtney was finished painting my toenails by the time I had been there for a mere 20 minutes.

"I am not big on casino hotels, unless it's Vegas, but I decided to give this casino hotel a chance.   The original room I reserved (E suite) only had 1 window, and it was in the bedroom. It was so high up and narrow, I had to stand in a chair to look out the window, with a horrible view. The room was dark. I had to turn on all the lights in the bedroom, LR and bar around just to walk around. It felt like a mouse trap. I got a lil claustrophobic. The room rate was $119. I asked for a suite with windows but all they had was a Player's Spa Suite with a jacuzzi tub in the middle of the room. That's kinda weird, so I declined and accepted a regular room. They didn't have any king beds, so I was put in a room with two queens. The rate was $69. The room was ok. Nothing special but clean.  I was scheduled to stay 3 nights at $69 x 3 plus one room service charge of about $22. They charged my card prior to my stay for $136 and some change, which would cover almost two night's stay. My bill wound up being early $200. A room that should have only cost me about $232 (room for 3 nights, room service) plus tax and fees wound up costing me almost $340. Problem? Yes. That means the tax and fees were nearly $100. That's crazy.  I've not had this problem with any other hotel, including resorts in Suncadia, Palm Desert, etc. I doubt I will stay at this location again.

"Never eaten there. This is based on my experience TRYING to eat here. It's a Monday night and my family was in town and I wanted to eat somewhere walking distance with a wide range of prices and options. This place's menu was perfect!  Even though it's a pizza shop/lower key restaurant, I had 10-12 people so I went online and decided to be considerate of the restaurant and my family to make a reservation online. They allowed up to 20 people for reservations so I figured I'm good! I made the reservation around 4:30 PM and it was for 6:30 PM. Late notice, yes, but like I said, this is a pizza shop!  I got a call from the restaurant around 5-5:30 PM and they said ""we're packed right now, we can't accommodate you until maybe 8:00 PM or 9:00 PM. My reply was simply, ""Okay we'll go somewhere else"". He said, ""Okay."" and hung up.  It's hard for me to understand why a restaurant serving pizza and quicker served plates can't accommodate a large table on a Monday night during dinner time with 2-hours notice.

"Such a terrible experience. I thought I had already written this, but I guess not. We decided to try this place out with some friends one night before an Indy Eleven game. We show up impressed by the location and excited for outdoor seating on such a nice night. We sit. We sit longer. Oh! Someone finally noticed they have new customers! We get some water and order beers. We sit some more. Decide what we want. Sit longer. Change our minds on our orders. 15min later... Beers! So we order and let them know that we are in a bit of a hurry at this point to make the soccer game. We get salads and they were pretty decent. We wait another 30min for food. Everyone gets theirs... but my order is something completely different from what I ordered. Different sandwich, different sides. I let the waiter know and this just totally shits on his day. I'm apparently the biggest pain in the ass ever for wanting what I ordered. Sigh.   Everyone starts eating (meanwhile we get the second round that we ordered 20min earlier). One of my friends finds an inedible piece of something that looks like fried chicken... in his cheeseburger. Now look, I'm on board for chicken beef sandwiches, but this was not that type of awesome situation. This was super gross and confusing. How'd that even get in there!?  So about 10 min before we need to be in our seats at the stadium I get my food to go and eat some of it in the car.

"The old IKEA was across the street from the old Holiday Inn The Palace and was a much smaller store.  When the present one opened up closer to the Airport, it was big and as Tim R. says it was all by its lonesome.  And now that the Borg Collective (South Edmonton Common) has assimilated most of the surrounding prairie, it's just part of a larger and disorienting suburban shopping experience.  Of course, where ever you go Ikea-wise, there you are.  They all pretty much have the same stuff and the food is good and cheap.

There's no indoor or outdoor seating (unless you count the bench outside) so it's a takeout spot. I originally planned to get the Cup Bop (like Korean bibimbap) but only poke was available since there was only one person working.  I got the regular sized poke for $12.99 which included 3 proteins and 7 additional toppings. I was surprised by the value of how much food and options I received. The toppings were great, all the proteins looked fresh, veggies were colorful and I saw many of my favorites including inari, seaweed salad and even Korean pickled radish. The brown rice was a nice short grain sushi rice.   Christian, the person working there, was patient in helping me through the process since it was my first time.

I don't even like spicy food, but wanted to eat it like soup it was so good!    The lunch menu had me not being able to decide between enchiladas, flautas or tamales, so I asked my server which was her favorite.  She quickly said, ""Enchiladas, and I can give you one of each...beef, chicken and cheese,"" so I agreed.  Oh my gosh.  Everything on that plate was amazing, even the rice and beans!  I could not pick a favorite enchilada, because whichever I was chewing was my favorite!  The food was so hot and fresh!  The ingredients were quality!  It was simply outstanding, and keep in mind it was the lunch menu!  My total was just over $8 and I had plenty to bring home for dinner.  Can't say enough about it.  Try it.

"Our party of 6 adults were looking forward to our stay at the Sonder Artist Lofts on Rampart St. in NOLA mid-March 2020.  We made the decision not to take our trip the day after the president first announced the travel ban from Europe. Prior to that we'd been monitoring the situation but were already past the 14 day period their cancelation policy requires for reimbursement when the COVID-19 crisis began emerging in the media, and we were hopeful to still go. However as events unfolded we could not in good conscience make this trip. We booked through Hotels.com and were advised to contact Sonder directly.  They refused to work with us in any regard.  We understand the effect that numerous cancelations could have on a company and were not asking for a refund but simply to be given a time frame to make the trip in the future.  After going back and forth they refused to budge an inch and we were required to pay the full amount and could not reschedule.  I was absolutely appalled. Our airline is giving us 12 months to rebook our flight , I simply can not fathom a company refusing to work with their customers, especially in light of an unprecedented crisis like this.  If we had chosen to go we would have been complicit in contributing to this public health crisis putting people's health and safety at risk, including our own. Amidst this ordeal we have seen so many good people and companies coming together to help one another.  This is not one of those companies. They are gouging people.   All adults in our group have agreed we will NEVER book with a Sonder again and will be sure to spread the word about this unethical company to all friends and family - especially the ones we know who are avid travelers.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 1.0

Since I was dining alone, I sat at the bar and the bartender, Tysen, was professional and fun to chat with. I had the wedge salad to start and the combination of candied pecans, bacon and blue cheese really makes it the best wedge I've had. My 6oz petite filet was prepared as requested and topped with so much flavor (lobster and asparagus). For dessert I indulged in the carrot cake that is most definitely big enough to share.

"Oh how I was looking forward to this place and we were sadly disappointed.  Why 3 stars: - If you've never been there, menu is on the wall and you order st the counter, you're given a number, and your food is brought out to you. We didn't know this so we stood in the doorway for about 5 minutes  waiting to be seated before someone told us what we had to do.  - The place is very small. There are only about 8 tables inside, so I'd imagine it would get insanely packed during dinner rush.  - The prices are high!  Pizzas are only 12 inches and cost about $17. We ordered 2 pizzas to split between 4 people and it wasn't enough food.  - water is self serve from a pitcher and it was empty. We waited for about 10 minutes for it to be filled so we could have something to drink while waiting for our food.  - it was super hot in there!  It was cold outside so you'd think the 800 degree open oven would be a nice source of warmth but it was too much.  I couldn't imagine the temp in the dead of summer in there.  There was some good:  The food is locally sourced and sustainable. The food did taste good and the selection of speciality pizzas were all very tempting.  We love pizza and eat a lot of it but unfortunately for me the negatives outweigh the positives for this establishment.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Of course, with this sort of this, its always kind of the luck of the draw on what bands/songwriters you will get and if it's your style of music, but we really enjoyed who we had.    We went on a Saturday night and were able to get a great spot right in the center (but there were only 2 of us).

"Not understanding the high reviews whatsoever. For our family it was all mediocre food and a high price. Service was friendly up front then slow when we needed help.   Parking is in their own lot and spacious as well as clean. That was close to as good as it gets to this write up.   The dining room was pretty empty at 1130 AM which is opening. Tables were clean as expected. A waitress did check in as we waited on another party to arrive.   Restrooms are in the rear and were clean. However a funky odor.   Menus were provided and orders taken. Drinks came out quickly. So a great start until our meals hit about 20 minutes later. My burger was over cooked and blah. My kids and wife also thought their sandwiches were just passable. There was also an error on one order and it was difficult to track our waitress down. We tried for possibly 10 minutes, no staff could be found. Our waitress did comp the meal.   2.5 rounding up for a clean dining room and great upfront service. I would never return or recommend.

"This was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a hotel. The staff was awful, just awful. We didn't end up completing our stay because of how poorly we were treated. On 9/22 my friends and I went to this hotel for a bachelorette party. We came in around 2 in the morning. Now, you may think, ""oh, bachelorette party, must have been wild and crazy,"" but that's not really my scene. I'm a pretty subdued person, we went to Crackers, ate some sushi and hungout for a bit. Of course we had been drinking, but in no way a ridiculous amount. We headed back to the hotel to open the presents my friends had gotten me. 2 of our friends went to grab some pizza and there were three of us in the hotel room. Within 15 minutes of arriving there, a police officer shows up at the door. When my maid of honor answered it, he just says, ""Yea, way too loud."" We had been talking in very normal voices, but we did have the tv on. When my friend reacted in surprise he again just repeated we were being too loud and walked off. He behaved in a super rude manor and we were left totally taken off guard. So of course we concede. We turned off the TV and and talked in even quitter tones, we were barely above whisper. The officer must have literally walked downstairs and immediately called us again because it was less than 2 minutes since he left our room that the phone rang and it was the officer again telling us to be quiet. By this time we're convinced he has the wrong room but he hangs up on us. We haven't made any noise above low talking, a kind that would be very well acceptable in a museum or something similar. So my friend calls the main desk to ask whats going on and  my maid of honor and i sit there and silently listen to her conversation. Before she can even get off the phone the police officer is back at our door now with a noise complaint, only it has the WRONG ROOM NUMBER and TIME. When my maid of honor points it out, he just says, ""ignore that, this is still for you."" I'm sitting next to the bed eating a cupcake my friend had made for me, and he accuses me of smoking. When we respond with a, ""what the hell are you talking about, that's a cupcake,"" he tells me my hands were too close to my mouth. At this point, its been less than 20 minutes since we walked into the hotel and we'd had enough. We packed are stuff and got ready to leave. I went down first to personally talk to the front desk to see what on earth was even happening. I was still convinced it had to be a mistake, and if I could just talk to them they would be reasonable and make this right. The front desk tells us there is nothing they can do and then the police officer walks up from the back room and accuses my friends of being completely intoxicated. He verbally accosts me for a while about myself and them. At this point, (I mean, come on, this is my only bachelorette party I'll ever get) I start to cry. I asked them why they are doing this, and we would just like to leave and have our money refunded. They said they wouldn't refund us, AND they are going to charge us for all the rooms around our room! By now my friends are downstairs with all of our bags and they start to argue with the front desk. Aft this point the officer again accuses my maid of honor of being intoxicated she asked him to breathalyze her so she could prove that she was not intoxicated. He laughed at her and walked away. When my friend brought up the fact that he had given us a complaint with an incorrect room number and time, he proceeded to go to grab a stack of complaint letters and start THROWING THEM at us! He said, ""here's one for you, and you and one for your lawyer!""  At this point I exited the building in tears. I couldn't believe that ANYONE would behave that way! So while I tried to calm down out front, my friends continued to argue with the staff. By this point, they are very mad about how they are being treated. After much more arguing and some more awful things happening that I don't have the energy to type out happened, we piled into our car and left.  I have never, ever in my life had such a terrible experience. I will never go to a Crowne Plaza hotel or any of its affiliates. We asked for the police officer's badge number, and he gave us a false one. After much researching, we figured out who he is and are currently filing formal complaints with the Indianapolis PD and Crowne Plaza. He is an off-duty police officer that Crowne Plaza hired to work security. I couldn't believe that the staff of this hotel just stood by and allowed him to verbally accost us, make false accusations, and behave so unprofessionally.  So if you ever stay in downtown Indianapolis do not choose the Crowne Plaza. You will be disappointed and mistreated by their staff, and quite possibly end up crying on a street corner at 3 am. Oh, and they charged 27 dollars for the vallet and didn't warn us. There is no easy way to get to other parking so its pretty much your only choice.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 1.0

They had a best quality & smelling hand sanitizer we found all weekend!  The service is warm and welcoming - shout out to Clay for being awesome!  The food was so unique and unlike anything I've seen around California. Some restaurants do hyper-local, but Barbs dishes - the way they were presented, and their flavor truly made you feel this was unique to only Central CA. Santa Maria style oak BBQ smoke is the underlying theme in ever savory dish, from salads to meats. The deserts and unique and delicious (+100 for successfully incorporating OG Khush terpenes into the Baked California!)

"I was so impressed with the service here!  I was looking for a Jeweler to change the battery in my nice watch.  I was politely greeted and told that they could change it while I waited.  Hufford's has an entire repair/jeweler's room off to the side that you can see in.  It was completed in 5 minutes at a very reasonable cost.

"Went here last night for dinner with another couple.  My husband and I  ordered the seafood boil with crab, shrimp and scallops.  We got it spicy which I regret.  I like spicy food but this was a bit much for me.  The service was good and my only critique would be to cook  the shrimp a little less.  Shrimp doesn't take long to cook and it was over cooked.  Other than it being a bit too spicy for me (that's on us) and the shrimp being over cooked, our meal was good--messy, but good.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

We watched both servers look over at us multiple times and then whisper to the manager before the manager finally came over and sat us. Our server Trevor looked over at our table and then walked past three times before we had to walk up to him and personally ask him for service. The food was good, but because of the incredibly awful service and lack of hospitality and customer service I won't be back.

"This restaurant is amazing. I've eaten here three times now--once for lunch and twice for dinner. All three times, the service and food have been superb. In fact, I've been in for dinner twice in the last two weeks. The first time, the server who took my order forgot to enter it into the kitchen before leaving (we were his last table for the night). When I questioned Kurtis, the manager who took over serving our table, he apologized profusely, got me the food immediately, and comp'd the order. The food was fantastic and totally worth the wait. Kurtis offering to rectify the situation by taking the meal off the bill was unsolicited and so kind. All the other food at the table was amazing, as well. We were celebrating a birthday and stayed a bit past closing, but the staff was patient with us and never rushed us out. I returned last night for another birthday celebration and ordered the All You Can Eat (AYCE). On the dinner menu, AYCE is a bit pricey at $30, but so worth the experience. The beef tongue and baby octopus are some of my favorites! The house-bottled souju is sweet and fantastic, too. I definitely recommend trying it. On both recent visits, I've been accompanied by large parties (10+ people). The servers are efficient, funny, and patient with the difficulties of organizing such large groups. Ijji 4 is quickly becoming a staple for birthday outings among my friends (and not just because the birthday person gets a free AYCE for bringing 6+ friends!), so I'm sure I'll be back many more times.

While enjoying my Maker's Mark (my go-to drink), and deciding what to have for dinner, I noticed their oyster bar.  Hmmm, ""oysters on the half shell with caviar and hot sauce"", ok I'll try it.  Well... two dozen of those bad boys later meant I had a wonderful dinner!   Damn, those things were awesome.  The most tender, freshest, tastiest oyster I've had.   These things just melted in my mouth with such a clean taste.   Accentuated with the caviar and hot sauce (not Tabasco, but Crystal Hot Sauce) - hot damn these oysters were ""the shit"".

"I've enjoyed the Thailand Restaurant since I was a little girl. I still remember giving some of my beads to the owners' daughter years and years ago when my moms' clients gave me tons of Gasparilla beads. They have upgraded the look quite a bit since I was little.   It's a very quiet but cozy atmosphere, and the food is delicious. I used to always get Chicken Pad Thai. Theirs has a sweeter taste to it that some people may not like but I love. It's what I compare all Pad Thai to. Other favorites are the lemongrass soup, basil noodles and bbq pork. They introduced specials in recent years including my favorites - crab rangoon and curry puffs. Both are delicious!   My parents also love the hot and sour soup (I can't do mushrooms) and pork surprise (which I only tasted and it's delicious!).  The service is absolutely wonderful.

"Great food, dining was awkward  3 of us came in for dinner around 8:45 mid-week. The restaurant is on a side alley off of South Street and you need to ring a bell to be let in. It almost seemed liked a secret and I really liked that. We walked into a  beautifully decorated room with ornate tapestries and wall hangings. There were only 2 other couples on the 1st floor besides us and the dining while good did seemed rushed. The server poured rose water over our hands which seemed like a wonderful custom but he did it so quickly it was almost awkward. They don't use napkins instead lay a towel across your lap. It was like a small bath towel which I found a bit disgusting and why would anyone wipe dirty hands (customary to eat Moroccan w/) on something laying on their clothes? Not cool.  The tasty salad course came out and while they gave us pita ( that had to literally be placed on the table) the culture is to eat with your hands, we were not comfortable and had to ask for forks. They brought one small plate which 2 of us shared. The second course came out and it was a hot, round, stuffed phyllo which they expected us to break with our hands. That is too many hands on my food for me and we asked that they cut it. It took some discussing between employees and owner for a few minutes but they did it for us. It was very tasty and kind of sweet, almost like something you would consider a breakfast dish. The 3rd course of chicken came out and I am SO HAPPY we still had our plastic forks. We had to ask for another dish for the third guest. Chicken was spicy, hot and savory. We ordered the lamb with honey and almonds for the 4th course and while very tasty for a 'kebab' was mostly bones and wasn't much meat. The couscous was good not great. For desert we were brought mint tea (in a glass cup not a tea cup) and one piece of baklava each which seemed to have been sitting in honey. I am particular about baklava and this was just soaked. The fruit was refreshing, they bring some grapes, strawberries, whole apples and bananas. Do they really expect people to sit and eat an apple in a social setting while sipping tea? More grapes and strawberries would have been better to nibble. This was my first time eating Moroccan food and while the atmosphere was exciting and diverse, the dining was just too hands on for my liking lol I have experienced Indian, Russian and even Uzbek and found this to just be messy and kind of cheap. Oh BTW they include 18% no matter what size the party. I find this intrusive for less then average service. For $25 it was decent to experience one time but I don't know if I'd go back here again. Maybe for take out because I did like the flavors but I would bring my own utensils.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"We were greeted half-heartedly at the door when my mom and I arrived for lunch.  It was just before noon. It took about 10 minutes for our order to be taken. We left almost 30 minutes later when we still hadn't received the burger I ordered or the salad my mom selected. In the mean time a table that ordered at least 10 minutes after us had bread and their meal delivered. At that point we decided to leave. When I informed the hostess that I'd pay for my drink but were cancelling our order and leaving, we were approached by a short bald man, presumably an owner or manager, who asked us if ""there was a problem."" I explained the situation, he mumbled that he'd take care of the drink and that the kitchen was ""a little backed up."" I don't understand how as I counted less than a dozen people in the place. There was no apology for wasting our time. I noticed someone taking a bunch of food from Sonic into the back. Maybe they were on a lunch break?

"This was the third house I got to see on my visit with the Legendary Haunt Tour.    We started out with a Haunted Hay ride. Again, I'm from Florida, we don't do these things, but In the north east I guess they're a THING.  Bates puts a lot of heart and soul into the scenes pacing them well and their actors seem to really get into it as well.   The Bates Motel was so well done! Makeup, costuming and actual haunt were all so very excellent. Timing of the actors, the variety of scares and not just relying on the BOO! factor. I especially liked the mossy creeper in the garden. He's got a lot of fun and range to play in. And I know it was cold when we visited, so Kudos to him.  The bloody Mary was also particularly memorable in the fact that she gave me WAY too much dialogue, but she was a delight when chatting with her after.   The corn maze/trail.. I LOVED the Vampire Nest, though threatening to choke me with my scarf? Now now, don't play into kinks. ;) Really though here was a lot of fun. I loved the circling of the scarecrows who played with you and the bubba's out in the middle of nowhere who wanted to eat us.

"Rippy's was recommended to me because it's a place to eat and catch live music at the same time.   The location is great! The bar is nice and was packed when we arrived (Friday night). I loved that they had a big stage that we sat near and listened to live country music. The live music was the best part of Rippy's for me, but in downtown Nashville you really can't expect anything less.   The food ... meh, sub-par food served in wax paper. If you don't like BBQ or are a vegetarian, this is not the place for you. The menu is extremely limited. They don't even have a house salad. No vegetarian option here aside from fried food ... that being said, the onion rings were some of the biggest and thickest I've ever had, but unfortunately they were overcooked. The ranch dressing that came with them was tasty. I'm very picky on good ranch dressing. My hubby had the pulled pork and said it was completely dry. He felt bad that there weren't any vegetarian-friendly options so he gave me his side of slaw. I love coleslaw and am really sad to say this is the worst we've ever tasted. It was so sour and bitter.   Overall, I'd say this is a decent place with reasonable prices to get *something* into your belly before hitting the bars.

"Entering the Ruby Slipper Cafe I felt as disoriented as Dorothy must have felt upon setting foot in Oz.  ""I don't think we're in Louisiana any more"" is what I thought to myself.  With its public commitment to the environment, composting, recycling, and buying locally, the Ruby Slipper seems more like the restaurants back home than those in New Orleans.  As I am not from the South, it also came as a surprise to have a waitress call me, ""Mah dahlin"".  In my book that's good for a few extra points on the tip.  The Bananas Foster French toast was simply the best french toast ever.  I am accustomed to French toast that comes with a heavy syrup that makes my stomach hurt half way through.  No such problem with the Ruby Slipper rendition.  I like French bread, so it only makes sense that French toast from French bread would work well.    Visually, the Bananas Foster was also a treat.  It has the appearance of three lengthwise slices of banana (the toast) topped with round slices of banana.  I could eat this all day.  Nirvana.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

But that was the last time I did not wait for the evening.  I really wanted to like this place.  I live in the neighborhood and want to shop local when possible.  But server, ""Tiger,"" kept willfully walking by table with no service over the course of 2 hours.  I've waited tables.  It is not easy.  Things happen, maybe she had a double section, maybe she was ill, I don't know.  But there was zero attempt at making right from the continued comedy of errors Sunday night.  The appetizer -- tater tots and cheese -- took 30 mins to come out!  The entrees - and we are talking cheeseburgers - ANOTHER 30 mins.  My table, where Tiger initially sat us, would be abandoned for 15-20 mins at a time -- except that she (the server) was walking by us over and again.  Was this absurdist theater?  Did we exist?  I thought she might try to smooth it over once she finally, and I mean after I BEGGED HER, to bring us the tab.  Nope, no hint of ""sorry.""    I am hating writing and leaving this review.

"I was happy to hear that Hilton bought this property and restored it - the classic charm of the Roosevelt fits right into their Waldorf-Astoria brand. The rooms, of course, are luxurious - super comfortable beds, really nice furniture and bathroom fixtures, flat screen tv (and one in the bathroom!), high end toiletries. Also a given was the top notch service they provide - everyone from the bell staff to housekeeping are super helpful and friendly.   The location is on the other side of Canal in the CBD, but close enough to all the action of the French Quarter. The entrance on Baronne is sketchier than the entrance on University, but I did feel safe regardless since it's not that far down the block and there is a 24 hr Walgreens on the corner, so it wasn't that bad.   As far as on site amenities, I loved that Domenica (John Besh's Italian themed venture) and the Sazerac are in the hotel.

The portion sizes are absolutely perfect and I love that you can share plates and still be satisfied. I took my mom out for dinner and we had this amazing burger and the first thing she said was ""this meat tastes so different, it's delicious!""

"My husband and I stayed at the Mason Beach Inn this past weekend. The rooms were nothing special, but they were clean. We enjoyed the jacuzzi and took advantage of the continental breakfast. You pretty much get what you expect. It's not one of the nicer motels, but  we didn't spend too much time at the hotel and we are not fussy about accommodations so this was fine.  The disappointing part of the experience came at Sunday's check out when the staff (Whitney) did not honor the rate that we were quoted (we went through a booking agency). I signed the receipt before seeing the rate/tax breakdown. This was stupid on my part because the receipt looked high. Whitney handed me the breakdown after I signed the receipt. When I told her that this was not the rate we booked at, She was emphatic that the hotel has NEVER offered the rate that we were quoted. She was totally unhelpful and, like a broken record, kept telling me that I would have to go through the booking agent because they have never published the rate I was mentioning. It was like banging my head on the desk as she kept repeating herself. I asked for a manager and she told me that I couldn't speak to a manager until Tuesday.  Fortunately, I called the booking agent, who in turn called the hotel. The hotel had different staff this morning. The staff apologized and confirmed that my initial rate was accurate.  Whitney did not know what she was talking about. The good part is that Mason Beach Inn has agreed to refund me the overcharge. The unfortunate part was that my experience with Whitney dampened our Sunday morning and tainted our Mason Beach Inn experience.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 2.0
"Now that I am working near Keystone at the Crossing, I am able to visit this and many other fine places at the mall.  It's worth coming to the mall just for Shapiro's but if you are already there...  Shapiro's has always been the most excellent food, I have only been to a few Deli style restaurants as nice with this kind of food, in NYC, Palm Springs, and Miami.  Shapiro's is an Indianapolis landmark too.  I prefer their chicken salad and potato salad, with marbled rye, but I know that their corned beef and other sandwiches are great and huge!  Be sure to get a fork to eat around the edges.  Desserts are great especially their black and white cookie.  What strikes me as setting Shapiro's apart from the crowd, is how clean it is.  The serving trays are warm so they have obviously been through the dishwasher, the tables are always clean (bus service is available, don't forget to tip) and the place is spotless.

When we checked in, they said the pool was opened only to be told later that they don't open until April. After confronting the owner, he had someone open it for us.

"Inside the beautiful Hermitage Hotel is The capital Grill.  The architecture is stunning. The wait staff is pleasant. The dining room has the appearance and feeling of a 5 star restaurant.  Unfortunately, the food we experienced was mediocre....not 5 stars in any way.   We ordered a Caesar salad  (I believe was $11) and it was nothing more than romaine lettuce on a plate with caesar dressing.  Not worth the cost and very disappointing.  I remember  the days when your server would hand make your Caesar at the table side. Unlike the current salad....   I ordered the special. A whole trout stuffed with crab. ($45)  It sounded fabulous.  When it arrived I was truly disappointed. There was barely any crab meat at all inside the fish. I had to dig around with my fork to even see any crab. This entree was NO where near worth $45.  We left disappointed. I will not return until this restaurant steps up its food quality.  I will save my money and spend it at other restaurants of which Nashville has plenty!!!",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 3.0

"I ordered online from yelp and it was flawless. I ordered a tempura udon and a pyramid roll and picked it up and took it home. When I looked at the bottom of the bag, there was some soup base and upon opening up the bag the lid was covered in broth sadly. They did not separate the noodles and tempura from the broth and by the time I got home it was soggy and falling apart. One other thing is the veggies inside. The sweet potato and seaweed are enormous. So big that if you leave it on top of everything it's the same size as the container itself. Even though this happened, the flavor was great and the roll looked and tasted great as well.   My suggestion in order to make this 5 stars is just to separate the noodles and tempura from the broth so it doesn't get soggy and to cut the veggies in smaller pieces.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

And then comes the waiting game! Your pizza could be at your door in ten minutes, or two hours.  Regardless of the wait, it's guaranteed to be cold and soggy.

"There are a lot of gripes I have for a place like this. If you charge more for diner food because you are upscale, make better food. We ordered stuffed french toast with goat cheese and one with cheese cake. The stuffed french toast was fine. I mean if you add goat cheese or cheese cake icing to anything, you'd like it. I don't think it was spectacular. We also didn't receive any syrup to go with it.   We also ordered onion rings which came out greasy and burnt....how can you screw up onion rings? I was just really surprised at the fact that I would have rather ordered onion rings from Burger King. I think the owners understand how to make a quick buck and how to be successful in St. Petersburg, but I truly do not think they can make good food.   Come here at 2AM when you are drunk, sure, but you can also just go to a steak and shake and get the same quality with probably better onion rings.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Udon and Katsu were fairly popular items. They arrived piping hot and in large portions. The were well prepared and presented. Among Korean foods, there were cod stew, yukkejang, beef, and pork bulgogi and some spicy stir frys.  I thought initially that some of the dishes were a little pricey, but the large portions were shareable and were encouraged to do so and they gave military discounts.

I have had more tolerable coconut soups before. The Yellow curry was the only thing that tasted great, aside from the water. The Phat Thai was what one would expect within a Thai restaurant, no more, no less.    The tea and everything else was just quite disappointing, the chicken in all my dishes were dry and bland.

"Bad food, worse service, and depressing decor.   Food: I ordered garlic chicken. The waitress (the owner's wife) told me what vegetables the dish contained. She mentioned the usual veggies that I like and expect in garlic chicken. The dish had a weird smell and I couldn't eat it.   The pork in my dining partner's main dish was so tough that it was nearly inedible.  Service: On this night, the owners -- husband and wife -- were the only two staff members present. He is the main cook and she is the main waitress. After our food was served, they sat at a back table in the eating area (I won't call it a ""dining room"") looking forlornly toward the front door and murmuring in Chinese. I can only speculate that perhaps they were wondering why there were only three customers inside at 7 p.m. and whether they would get another customer that night.  Meanwhile, I had moved my rejected main dish toward the edge of the table so I didn't have to smell it and did my best to eat some of my partner's pork dish. The wife/waitress did not approach us after serving us until it came time for the check. She was not at all concerned about my uneaten meal. Instead, she said that I had agreed to the ingredients. I explained that I generally like the ingredients in garlic chicken at other restaurants, but did not like this restaurant's sauce. She proceeded to make me feel like a bad customer due to not understanding the ingredients and ordering the wrong dish.  She did not offer a replacement dish. (It would have been too late, anyway, but an offer would have been nice). I politely and quietly requested a partial refund. She said she would have to talk to her husband.   A couple of minutes later, there was a shouting match in Chinese from the kitchen, loudly heard in the customer area. I probably was the unwilling cause. At any rate, guess I lost that one. There was no offer of a replacement dish nor a discount.  Decor: I don't necessarily require  fanschi-schmanchi modern decor, but this place looks neglected.   New Asia Chinese Restaurant has been in our neighborhood for many years, but I gave up on it more than 10 years ago due to the poor quality of food and service back then.

We kept in touch with Annie throughout the wedding planning process to bounce ideas with her, and she was always quick to respond. My fiancé also decided to rent a Chinese Qipao dress from Only You, and Annie worked closely with her to ensure it matched my fiance's style, taste, and figure.  As our big day finally came upon us, Annie took it upon herself to be there at our event to coordinate the DJ and MC services. Her team arrived early to ensure they were set up in time for the ceremony, and provided great sound and music (we decided to go with our own custom playlist) for the procession. Annie's team then seamlessly transitioned over to the ballroom to begin the reception activities.   From the beginning, we knew we wanted to work with her MC partner, James. We had attended two weddings before that James had serviced, and were impressed by his energy and vigor. He kept the crowd enthused through the evening as a host, and made sure the music aligned with the mood of dinner and dancing. When speaking of James to others, I describe him as an ""Asian Ryan Seacrest. He's that good! Plus he speaks fluent English, Cantonese, and Mandarin.""  We can't thank Annie, James, and the whole Only You Wedding team enough for helping us make our wedding the most memorable day of our lives!",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 5.0

"I haven't been in probably a year and had a horrible experience. First, they usually ask what level of spice you want but did not when I ordered so it came out quite bland. Second, on my way out my Thai tea busted open because the to go cups are so thin. I went back inside and asked for a new bag and some napkins and the cashier proceeded to laugh as if Thai tea all over my food, pants, car, wallet, phone etc was amusing. Third, and worst, as I'm eating my food, I notice something blue in it. They dropped a rubber band in my food. Will never attend again. Ridiculous prices and mediocre food.

"The only thing better than pizza place that sells beer is a pizza place that delivers beer. Enter Fornos Pizzeria, which is that special place to do both!  The different gourmet pizzas are on display behind glass, ranging from BBQ pizza to buffalo chicken pizza to margarita pizza. The actual pizza slices are large, flavorful, and have a balanced level of moistness to avoid having either soggy or dry pizza. They also serve buffalo chicken salads and various Italian dishes. It's more than just a pizza place, serving Sunday Gravy like any Italian establishment.  Fornos has an outdoor concrete patio and a spacious interior, with both being solid dining options. The front counter staff is friendly and they bring your food over to your table. It's a win/win for anyone looking for a casual quick bite to go with a beer, or vise versa!

"I am in love with Coquette.  With a handful of exceptions, the best dining experiences are outside of the French Quarter.  There are FQ places that I have visited often:  K-Paul's, Antoine's (although it sucked this visit, another review), Galatoire's,  R'evolution, Arnauds.  I was seeking an out-of-the-box experience this trip and Coquette delivered for me....warm n fuzzy, fresh and earthy.    Coquette is about a 10 minute Uber ride from the FQ.  I came across Coquette on Yelp first.  The high marks from my Yelpie Wayne C and Shannon and other  Yelpeviews were a good sign and prompted me to look into Coquette further.  Coquette is owned by Michael Stoltzfus (former sous chef at August)  and Kristen Essig (former executive chef at Meauxbar).  Mr. Stoltzfus is self taught and immediately I am curious.  Either I'm gonna hate the food here or I'm going to be wowed or feel lukewarm.  I have not  been to either resto only because I shy away from super formal (don't get me started on dressing up for dinner) places like August and Meauxbar I hear is very popular but haven't made it there.      I had a topsy turvy work week and conference calls that week.   So I called Emma at Coquette to reschedule and within minutes, she called me back and got me an opening and worked with my schedule. First, I was floored by Emma's hospitable voice.   I was awed with her desire to help, a very warm sounding person as opposed to the formal, curt, restaurant reservations staff.  I  thought  to myself, ""if she represents this restaurant I am in.""  I also noticed the restaurant was full so Thank you Emma.   My waiter Matt was also very helpful and hospitable. He brings a basket of freshly baked crusty bread and delicious butter.  The night before,  I had soft bread that was microwaved from Antoine's, no lie.  Antoine's should order bread from Coquette; Ya hear me Antoine's?   He recommended dishes that he thought represented the restaurant.  The menu looked inventive and delicious.   I started with a smoked  cobia (fish) and a gulf shrimp and grits. The shrimp and grits were flavored with chorizo, fennel pollen, mascarpone  that made the dish not only delicious but warming to the soul.  I took a bite and hadda close my eyes.  Awed.  The fish, cured with green tea, served on cucumber topped with crème fraîche and spruce, were reminiscent of Scandinavian flavors I've had at Michelin restaurants in Copenhagen this year.  The fish was smoked beautifully, layered with crisp thin cucumber, and spruce (yes pine flavor) and crème, so excellently made.  The popcorn rice sent me to another flavor and textures experience I have not had in NOLA:  Louisiana long grain rice, popcorn, crab, jalapeño powder, an all white plate that intrigued me in the same way  a well made all white pasta dish was expertly made inItaly.  It's tough to pull off dish like this yet Stoltzfus made the rice, crab, popcorn in contrasting textures mesh to a truly delicious plate.  Kristen, Michael's co-owner came by and introduced herself.  She helped me pick a dessert yet came back with two because I was curious about the mille feuille with apple essences and specks of blue cheese.  Let me say that the dessert she recommended (Sweet potato flan,  tarte, pecan, cranberry, orange cream, root beer) was not only a genius holiday dessert, I could've gobbled another serving ha ha.  The mille feuille was a kaleidoscope of new tastes to me:  frozen apple essences, crisp pastry and blue cheese.  This dessert was excellent!  At dinner's end,  Michael Stoltzfus came out from the kitchen to say hi.  I was  thankful he took the time to meet people who eat there.    Wines by the glass were nicely complementary to the dishes and nicely priced.    I am in love Coquette.  Verdict?   Wowed. Loved it.  Coming back.  Thank you so much Emma, Matt, Michael and Kristen for your awesome help and introducing this newbie to your restaurant.    Visits: 1  Tip:  Portions are are not huge, it is what it is.   There are larger plates on the menu if you care to augment your orders.  I was quite content and very full after my 3 small plates.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"It's a dud. I've been wanting to try for a while and finally made it for brunch today because it's outdoor tent dining only and I didn't want to be cold. Made a resy on google, arrived and seated immediately.  Outdoor tent area was spacious, warm enough, and decor was pleasant. I ordered eggs Benedict with the breakfast potatoes extra well done with onion. Oh boy, it was all wrong. First glance, the eggs were glopped with whole seed Dijon with some grease seeping out...ok I've had Dijon hollandaise before and liked it... but it wasn't described as such on the menu, and it was 90% whole grain Dijon. I like Dijon, so I figured I'd give it a go and eat it anyway. One of the eggs was completely cooked through, not a ""Benedict"" style egg I'd expect. The ham was like thinly sliced deli meat, not the Canadian bacon or thicker ham steak style of meat I would've expected. I actually preferred the thinly sliced ham, so that was a positive mark. On to the breakfast potatoes... a total abomination. Large cubed potatoes, still hard in the middle. If they were well done, as ordered, I can't imagine how undercooked they would've been if I haven't ordered well done. I asked for onion, again large undercooked pieces that also included the hard onion skin. It was as this point my mind processed that if they're careless about their prep, what else are they careless about? I stopped eating mid way. I should've sent the whole dish back but didn't want to hassle the young waitress and just asked for the check when I saw her. My dining partner had the two eggs breakfast. Eggs were cooked over easy as ordered. Breakfast potatoes were just as woeful as mine. He asked for white bread but they only had sourdough or whole grain. He was starving and ate the whole thing, even though that too missed the mark. Can't say I'll go back. It's pricey, and they try to fancify a simple breakfast which would be great if it was well executed to begin with.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"We ate here for what we thought was going to be a romantic dinner, we got all dressed up, and wound up eating in what was basically the lounge of a hotel.  I've eaten in restaurants attached to a hotel before that were completely seperate from the hotel, this one was small and empty, we were the only ones there.    The place was cute and nice, but it felt exactly like a hotel lounge bar.  The menu also had very few choices on it, was only 1 8x14 page, on just 1 side of it.  We had a very good waitress/bartender, my only complaint with her was that when our food came she started a long conversation, so much so that our food was cold.  But I can't really fault her, she looked bored as all get out.  The meal was reasonably priced, other than it being cold, but that could have been fixed by eating it when the food arrived.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Nice addition to the food/beverage scene on the Main Line.  Foods good, but portions are small and the price is high.  Whiskey isn't my thing so I'm just here for the food...    I've been here twice now, once for brunch, and once for dinner before a show at the Ardmore Music Hall.    Brunch was good, but so slow.  Our party of 6, including one toddler, took almost 2 hours from start to finish.  I think 1 person in our group got a cocktail, other than that it was just food\tea\coffee.  It was good, but I'd rather goto Nudy's or Sabrina's for brunch where you get more common brunch fare.  My Huckleberry French Toast was good, but I'm not in a rush to go back and get it again.  Someone also got a peanut butter\banana waffle which looked delicious, but it was just a regular waffle with a spoonful of peanut butter on it and a banana laying on top.  Cost for brunch for 5 plus a toddler was only 90$, which isn't too bad...just took a while!    Dinner for 2 was a bit more pricey...I think the issue was with one of the drinks we ordered.  We both got appetizers, Wedge Salad and Wings for me, Wedge Salad and Pork Ribs for her.  I got a beer, she got a cocktail.  83$!  Wow that must have been one expensive cocktail.  Sadly she ordered off the menu and I don't think the bartender appreciated it.  Not only was it not very good, but it was incredibly expensive.  When my date suggested the bartender didn't know how to make it, I suggested he knew exactly what he was doing and that she order something on the menu next time...  The bar area seating has the most uncomfortable bar stools.  You're butt may fit on this thing, but mine mostly hangs off the side.  Very uncomfortable, but I guess they are trying to save space with smaller seats.  Great pic of Jerry inside, check it out.    You should definitely try it out, particularly if you like Whiskey.

"My first experience at Hamburger Mary's was fun and delicious. We were visiting from South Florida, so we made a reservation earlier that day. We got to the restaurant a bit earlier than our reservation time, but were seated promptly. I was a bit disappointed as we were kind of sat in the back so we didn't have a full view of the stage, but the queens did come around.   We ordered an appetizer to start with to make some time before the show started, and after reading some yelp reviews raving about the fried mac and cheese balls, we decided to get an order. They were really tasty; a bit greasy, but delicious, the Mac and cheese was creamy goodness.   My boyfriend and I both ordered burgers; he the Barbra-que burger and I the mushroom burger. We both enjoyed them, pretty standard compared to burgers at other restaurants, good but I wouldn't say out of this world.   For dessert, we shared an espresso ice cream float, which was also very delicious.   The drag show was super fun to watch, the MC was hilarious and even did birthday shots with the newly 21-year-olds. All of the queens were having fun with the crowd and dancing, it was great. My boyfriend and I are huge fans of Rupaul's Drag Race so we live for drag queens.

"This is one of my favorite stores I always find something that I like there. I'm hoping I get his name right, (I believe his name is Tariq) whom helped me at the register today.  He is pretty awesome! Very professional and informative about the prices and the discounts and things of that nature.  I wish I could give a rating to individual employees because he would definitely receive a five star from me.  But....on the other hand, I had to ask for this girls name, which was Stacy. (She wouldn't get one star from me) She was completely annoying me today.  It was very obvious by her going out of her way not to make eye contact with me so that she would not have to assist me and trying to ""APPEAR"" busy. It very annoying and unprofessional. I started to request to see a manager and changed my mind. Sometimes you can do more by not giving people like her that attention in the store. I figure that there is a lot of power in the Internet/social media. Especially on forms like this.... It's very sad in this day and age that people want to judge you by your appearance or what they think you might be or who you are without uttering a word to you. So ...they do their very best not to have to interact with you. Meanwhile,  you're looking them dead in the eye  and all they can do is bow their head like a coward. She could truly use a customer service 101 refresher course. The variety of patrons at that location is very diverse and if she has an issue with people, A certain race, other women, or whatever the case may be...she should seek employment elsewhere.

"Mmmm, mmmm. Yum and goody are the prefixes which I start with. I would have never walked in the place if it wasn't for Groupon.  First impression was that it was small but cozy and warm (especially with it being 17 degrees outside). Groupon entitled us to (and which we were provided) soup or salad, one pizza (10"") to share and two entrees. The salad was good with the basalmic vinegarette. My boyfriend had a butternut squash soup which was pretty good. We chose the pesto pizza, which was delicious. Made me want to try the others of which there were a variety.  And as  usual he went with the chicken alfredo.  It was creamy in texture and a delight to eat. I went with the penne vodka with shrimp.  I thought there would be medium shrimp throughout but the shrimp were on the extra large size and succulent to say the least. It was full of flavor and I enjoyed. Didn't finish it all because I was stuffed from the pizza but I'm definitely looking forward to my leftovers from what I did get a chance to eat of my pasta dish. Wait staff were friendly, knowledgeable and all around awesome. In short will make it my business to go back. Only reason it didn't get a 5 star was price.

"From my delivery instructions for ALL restaurants:  ""DRIVER MUST BE WEARING FACE MASK OR ORDER WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED!!!  NO EXCEPTIONS - PERIOD!!!  THANK YOU!""  About 3 months ago, I ordered from Brandywine and the driver refused to follow my simple but CLEAR instructions.  He acted offended when I kept my word and refused to accept the order. I have a photo of him standing in the street looking like a deer caught in a car's headlights, in apparent disbelief that my instructions were for REAL!   Deers are ""cute"" but they're not very smart animals. They'll let themselves get hit by a moving car before they figure out that it would be a better idea to get out of the road. Kinda like that driver and Brandywine Pizza altogether.  However, out of respect for the dumb and possibly dead by now and for legal purposes, I'm not going to post that photo here, although I'd like to.  The delivery service that I ordered through refunded the price of my order to me with no objections. They understood that my instructions were for REAL and had NO problem with refunding me.  Tonight, I tried to order from Brandywine again and they refused to fulfill my order because, at a time when the COVID pandemic is at it's WORST than at any time since it first hit this country, including right here in Philadelphia, Brandywine Pizza couldn't CARE LESS about my health and well being or yours, and prefers to hold a grudge rather than acting like civilized human beings.  So if you don't mind doing business with wild rabid beasts and don't care about your life and the lives of your family, friends and others, then Brandywine is the THE PLACE for you!  But if you DO care, then I would suggest that you avoid the COVIDIOTS AT BRANDYWINE PIZZA LIKE THE PLAGUE that they wouldn't mind ""sharing"" with you!  I'm giving Brandywine 1 star because I can't give them less, and because they do deserve some ""credit"" for remembering me after 3 months even though they still can't figure out why most people prefer to not have their health and lives threatened by COVIDIOTS!  BTW, my order from Domino's just arrived and their driver, like just about every other restaurant in town's drivers (and I order dinner in at least 3 times a week these days) arrived wearing a face mask.

Another Korean place my sister-in-law and I had to try. Let's go down the typical list we think every Korean place ought to be graded on:  1.) Kimchi 4/5 2.) Starter dishes 3.5/5 3.) Beef Quality 2/5 4.) Soup 3/5 5.) Pancake 3/5 6.) Noodles 3/5  The best thing about this place is the RICE! They have the BEST purple/black rice. This stuff is expensive and they actually serve it. No place in Tucson has this rice. How obsessed am I you ask? Well I shopped Lee Lees Korean aisle for an hour trying to find it and even resorted to asking my Korean client on where to buy it - to no avail!   I do wish they used better quality beef because it was one of the worst. All-in-all it's okay. I don't think we would try again because they didn't well in the areas we deem as important but everyone should still go and try. I gave 3 stars but it does deserve 3.5 but not 4.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"We have eaten here several times with similar results and a low tonight.  The service is typically very slow, especially for initial drink orders and food.  Tonight they apologized for the slowness, blaming the large parties.  We were only 3, but we ordered appetizers, at least 2 drinks per person, and entrees.  The food was variable with an overcooked burger (asked for medium and got very well) but really good scallops.  We declined on dessert, relatively quickly got the check and within 5 minutes of paying were asked to leave to free up the table.  Apparently food and drinks can take forever, but how dare we talk for a few minutes after finishing.    Food is generally good but service seriously needs to improve to get us back, especially for the price of the food.  There are many better places, even in Reno.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 3.0
"Was here for a business meeting on 2/17 and found it quite nice. It's pretty spacious, and the décor is nice. It's a bit noisy because of the acoustics in the place, but overall it's a nice atmosphere. I had the chicken curry dumplings, the shrimp and beef tenderloin, and the chocolate hazelnut mousse.  All were delicious, most especially the entrée. The shrimp and tenderloin were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was tasty and not overwhelming. My dinner party also had goat cheese salad, sushi, lo-mein, and the mini-donut dessert, which looked wonderful as well. The service was quite nice and very professional. It's a little pricey, but an enjoyable experience.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I got the Don Camaron grilled burrito and the sonoran dogs. My wife got the Percheron burrito with carne asada.  The Don Camaron was great, particularly when I added some medium tomatillo salsa from the salsa bar. The sonoran dogs were nothing to write home about, especially when compared to either of the big hitters here in Tucson (you know which I'm talking about).   My wife said the Percheron was very good. Big portions too (not HUUUUUUGE) but definitely enough.

"This is about my online experience as the card that came with my order suggested I write about. I'm giving it one extra star above the 1 I want to give it to, because the jewelry itself is cute and the customer service appears at first to be really thorough and effective. However, in reality, that's not the case at all.   I ordered a Duchess necklace in March and by April a tassel fell off. I wrote to them expressing my disappointment in the necklace not even lasting a month, especially for something at a relatively high price point considering the metals they use. I was offered a replacement to be sent out right away.   Received the replacement....without a tassel!! I do not understand. You would think a replacement going out for an issue would be double checked? Nope.  So I wrote back again with a picture of everything still in the packaging and no tassel. Another replacement. I expressed my concern over the price point and what I was starting to realize was really shitty quality, so they offered me a small partial refund which I appreciated.   2.5 weeks later....replacement never showed up. Called to ask for the tracking and they tried to blame it on my not having the apartment number...I've lived in the same building for 18 years and have had the same mailman for 14. There is literally 0 confusion when something gets left at my building without an apartment number and, to further prove my point, the original necklace and first replacement didn't have it either, and they made it just fine. I asked again if I could have the tracking number to please look into it and they put me on hold only to tell me that they were sending a new one with FedEx two day and that the other one was actually just lost in transit. Still no tracking number for that one  Honestly at this point, with three issues over one order, I won't be wasting my time again. It doesn't seem like good enough quality and what appeared to be super responsive customer service just turned out to be an attempt at it, not the real deal. Really wish it hadn't been the case.   Regarding the necklace itself, I was also disappointed in the fact that it did not fall anywhere near where most of the online pics show it as. I assume they used an unconventional extender for the sake of the pictures, because the extender that comes on the chain leaves half the tassels on one side and none on the other if you use it that way.",Business Category: Home & Garden,Review Stars: 2.0

"Ok this place is ridiculous. First off, I felt like the decor was so overdone that I literally felt claustrophobic. Then the service is so bad for what this restaurant is supposed to be. I've worked as a waitress in a high end restaurant and one of the first things I learned is that you never stack the plates on top of one another when you collect them- it looks gross and they could all fall down. Our waiter did exactly this and it was so haphazard that I was scared that they were going to fall out onto my dress. Another thing that we were laughing about was that our waiter had literally no control over the volume of his voice, and since the place is kind of a quiet, date-night scene, literally every time he would go to a table around us in his section, he would speak so loudly that is was so jarring and our conversation would be interrupted. Lastly, I know this is a family business, so I don't know if the young busboys were hired out of pity or something, but they were the worst- just trained soo badly. One of them brought us a totally empty jar of oil for our salads (how do you not see/feel that the bottle is completely empty on the way over???) and then the other one asked us if he could have our vinegar about 20 seconds after we got it, so we had to explain that to him. The worst was when we were eating our main courses, I looked over to see that one of the young busboys was LAYING FACE DOWN ON THE FLOOR. Just laying there for a while, like a 5 year old who is tired- at some point he even started dragging himself around like that. If the owners see this, ask our waiter about it, the one who was so proud to say that he was in the third generation or whatever of the family that owned it, but found it funny every time he stepped over the guy laying on the floor. I mean, I know it was after the dinner rush, but if I owned a restaurant and knew that my employees were acting this unprofessional and that their service was this bad, I would be mortified.  The only reason why I gave this place 2 stars is that my veal piccata was great, even if it came in the form of a warm food mush on my plate with about 20 other side dishes, which I was not expecting. I would recommend not doing this, it's gross and a lot of the things don't really go with the main dish. It's also weird that everyone gets the same grouping of mushy side dishes, it feels like we're all getting a scoop of the leftovers from the kitchen.   Overall, bad job, Cote de Basque!!

My most recent visit, the service was so terrible I actually wondered if it was a reality TV show to see how people would react to such bad service. 1-2 service people helping to cut fabric at a time, and here are some examples that occurred on my most recent visit: constant socializing and chatting by employees with lines of people waiting, waiting for customers to go continue shopping and reconsider fabric choices (but rather than assisting the next customer, the employee just waits with delays of 10-15 minutes for at least 4 customers in front of me), and letting other customers cut in line in front of others that had been waiting 45+ minutes.

"Boyfriend and I wanted to try something new and my cravings for jambalaya could not be contained, so we ended up here.  Ambiance is definitely classy and restaurant is spacious despite what you see at first glance.  The chef even makes his rounds around to make sure you are enjoying your dinner.  We first started with a small complimentary (?) dish which consisted of sweet pickled red peppers and Asiago cheese.  It was so, so good.  Then we proceeded with the Trio of Soups, $8.  I forgot the exact names of the soups, but the white creamy one with crab was among the best.  Super creamy, sweet, and not really loaded with lumps of crab, but still awesome.  Boyfriend ordered Filet Mignon, $29, and I Shrimp with Cheese Grits, $25.  As mentioned above, I originally wanted jambalaya, but the server said jambalaya is a huge, huge dish, so I opted for the Shrimp with Cheese Grits instead.    Filet Mignon is Filet Mignon; not the best.  Shrimp with Cheese Grits were yum and I'm happy that I chose it over the jambalaya.  For dessert, we played it safe and got the Creme Brulee.  It was decent/good.  Boyfriend, on the other hand, thought it was amazing.

"Went over the weekend. Knowing that quality sushi places in Boise is not realistic, decided to try anyway. Ordered Katsu and it was paper thin and looked pressed down. Kids wouldn't even touch it. Not only that, it was cust to look like noodles almost. They should be a good half inch to 3/4 inch wide and these were about a quarter inch wide. Taste was bland where it should have been juicy. Ordered tempura udon. Broth was horrible and tasted like it was ochazuke. Any Japanese restaurant should know the broth is the key ingredient. The noodles is fine but it is the broth that makes or break the taste. And it's so easy to get this decently right that it's sad they didn't even try. Ordered sushi.

I ordered a full slab with double fries (knowing they would be soggy by the time I got home). However, I was not expecting the ribs to be disappointing. Half of the ribs were marvelous, the other half were well past over done, burnt to well burnt, and dry.  Maybe this was an over site, maybe this was because the ribs were not suitable for the dine in area???...  I have never experienced this inconsistency while dining in, I only wish the same quality control is observed when the order is a carry out.

My wife chose the caprese salad and the steamed clams and I choose the mac and cheese and kobe beef sliders. The menu states that items are delivered to the table as they are prepared in the kitchen. We had never been to a tapa restaurant before but it was kind of fun to anticipate which item would arrive first.   We sipped our drinks and the caprese salad arrived first which my wife said was simple and delicious. Next, the beef sliders arrived and looked very tasty as well. The steamed clams arrived and included a good amount of bread to dip in the broth. Last, was the mac and cheese which was baked in small dish and looked equally incredible.

Selection is good as are the prices. They redid the store not so long ago and put in a seating area in the back with a TV. I think it is kinda a waste given the size of the store since the humidor is very small and almost uncomfortable if you have even two people in it at one time.

"Had an appointment with a NP- appointment went fine, staff was nice enough. They were supposed to refer me out to Banner for a procedure (an urgent procedure.) Weeks later, I'm still being told by Banner that they haven't received the referral. I have been calling and leaving messages for various departments for WEEKS- marked all my messages as urgent- never got a response. I finally called the appointment scheduling dept. just to get through to a real person and I was told that it's ""hard for them to get back to people because they're short staffed."" EXCUSE ME?! YOU ARE A MEDICAL PRACTICE. PEOPLE CALL YOU WITH URGENT MATTERS. I CANNOT GET MY PROCEDURE DONE UNLESS YOU SEND IN MY REFERRAL. I called Presidio Medical Group (GREAT practice.) and they told me that they've heard several complaints about AZ Gastro not returning calls and THEY called the office and (hopefully) got them to send the referral in. I've seen countless reviews saying people never get calls back from this office. Run for the fucking hills if you're ever referred to this practice for an urgent health matter. How this office is still in business when they can't even return a fucking phone call is astounding to me.",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 1.0
"I love having Bistrot la Minette in my neighborhood. I love that it's down the street, making the block even more adorable.Though tonight...tonight, trudging home in the rain, the sight of it made my face twist into a bitter wince.   ""Look at them in there, clinking wine glasses. I bet those bastards are eating Flammenkuche.""   That's a delicious. Alsatian style ""pizza."" Think about caramelized onions, lardons, creme fraiche. Think about it and weep.   I'm not a jealous person, except for people's meals. Seriously, that's the only thing. I tried to stop myself from dwelling on the fact that while some are enjoying delectable, plump escargots tonight, I am not. I shivered in the rain like some urchin-wretch-thing, and peered up into  the windows as I passed by.  I reminded myself that I owe Bistrot La Minette more than a few good reviews.  I love the special menu prix fixes, presented like ""a visit to."" We've enjoyed a night in the Basque country last year, and then a trip to Alsace Lorraine, to name a couple. $35 or 50 with wine pairings, and it's a swell deal if you're askin me. The wine pairings have been excellent in our experiences. I learned that I love gewurztraminer, who knew? I know what you're thinking about me. ""It's not like it was a long shot.  It's booze, ain't it, sister?"" I'll remind you that I have refined taste. And I learned how to pronounce ""gewurztraminer.""   Anyway, I definitely recommend the French regional dinners for sure.   The food is delicious and beautifully prepared. I already mentioned how I nearly flew into a jealous rage at the thought of the Alsatian pizza and the wonderful, buttery snails. Now and then we'll just stop in for those two appetizers and a drink or two.  I can recommend the duck breast with blood orange gastrique. Same for the Lapin Roti a la Moutarde. Dijon mustard braised rabbit, you were the first bunny that I've ever bitten.  I love the atmosphere, the decor... It's feels super French and special, yet comfortable neighborhood-place all at once. Dig the long red banquette that runs the length of the dining room. I dig that my husband always lets me sit on that side! I think that the streetlight bulbed chandeliers are so cool. Outdoor seating in the warmer months is pretty lovely. OH and speaking of lovely, and warmer months- Bistrot La Minette plays French films- a dinner and French film al fresco. It's pretty nice. It's something to sigh about. Ahhhhh....  There's a lot to love about this place; lotsa stuff happening, events highlighting wonderfully authentic French foods...  Bistrot La Minette, you're a good restaurant-neighbor.  Many times we'll be leaving after a meal and I'll begin to hum a medley of Edith Piaf tunes as I float home...not because any of the songs played in the restaurant. Not at all cause they didn't.

"I think Poke Loa is a great addition to the CBD! It's right across from the CBD Rouses and has plenty of seating available. Saw lots of folks who worked at close by businesses stopping in for their lunch break. I went probably at their busiest time of the day and got in and out in less than 10 minutes. They had a ton of employees on the floor so the line moved quickly. Everyone was super friendly and very efficient! The space is super hip looking (do the kids still say hip?) and clean. I've frequented the magazine street location in the past and feel like this location is good food/service consistency wise. A slight difference is this one has a bar with booze and happy hour! #treatyoself  I ordered a large bowl (I was extra hungry but the bowl is honestly big enough to split with another person) with a scoop of tuna, salmon, and spicy salmon. I also added some tóbiko, edamame, mango, crab salad, and other goodies. I've never had something from here that I wasn't happy with!

"Here's the thing, I so want to love Osteria Pronto. I really do. I LOVE the decor; it really took me back to a lovely restaurant I ate at in Florence (Osteria del Chiangale Bianco). The food. Well. The food. And, what really killed it was the service.   First things first, the food: I loved the bread basket. YUM.  I had the calamari as an appetizer and I just didn't think it was very special. It was rubbery (eww!) and just not that good.   My main was the gnocchi. And I have to say, it was delicious. Many might find it salty, but I loved it. I finished it all. It was lovely.   I was too full for dessert, but if I ever go back I'll skip the appetizer so I can have dessert.   And now, the service. If you've read my reviews you know I'm big on service. It matters. And at OP, it was just overbearing, a little snooty, not well-timed, and overall, not what I expected. What was even crazier was that the waiter wanted to treat my table as if we were at some fine-dining, chic chic establishment, when at the table next to me, there was a baby literally wailing for about 2 hours. It was the oddest thing. Funnily enough, the person I assume was the manager came over to see how they were doing (the couple with the baby) but never stopped to see how we were. I found that a little strange since it seemed like he was making rounds. it was as if he knew what I was going to say.   Any way, three stars.

"Superica has earned a spot on my list of go-to Tex Mex spots in Nashville. I started with a skinny margarita which was one of the best I've had -- I never guessed it was the mildly healthier take on the classic. We proceeded to the complimentary chips and salsa, which is a rarity for upscale Tex Mex restaurants in Nashville. The verde salsa was phenomenal -- I very easily could have eaten it with a spoon. The more traditional red/brown salsa was also very good. It was a tad bit spicier with a faintly smoky flavor. The chips were light and perfectly salted. We also ordered the guacamole which was perhaps the most beautifully plated guacamole I've ever seen in person. It was chunky yet creamy with a zesty kick of lime in almost every bite. I really liked that it was served with sturdier chips -- fried and flaky with just enough crispiness to support each bite of guac.  While the menu had so many tempting options to choose from, I knew I had to go with one of my favorite enchiladas -- the Pollo con Mole. Where to begin? Ever since first being introduced to the cocoa-infused mole sauce (just one of many mole varieties), I've been hooked. Superica's mole was some of the best I've had in quite some time. The braised chicken was cooked perfectly and paired seamlessly with the mild sweetness of the sauce. The layer of cheese and onions on top rounded out everything beautifully. Every single bite was a delicious whirlwind of flavors, and none were too overpowering.   The side of rice and beans weren't as earth-shattering, but they made for great accompaniments to the enchiladas. The refried beans were the perfect consistency with just enough cheese sprinkled on top. The rice was cooked perfectly, and I loved the diced peppers mixed in.   The patio was spacious and heated, perfect for social distancing. And the service was top-notch, from the hostess to the bartender to our waiter. Everyone was friendly and very attentive.  While it will be hard not to order the Pollo con Mole next time I go to Superica, I can't wait to try some of the other menu items.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

For me, the effects last several days and steadily improved throughout the rest of the summer.  She really retrained my jaw muscles to sleep when the rest of my body does.

The problem is that twice I went there with friends 30 min before closing and the server was very unwelcoming to us.  The first time he just rushed us through and it was very awkward because I could feel that he didn't want us there.  He never smiled or tried to make any conversation,  he just rushed us and gave us disapproving looks.  The second time he was again trying to rush us. I ordered a mango boba drink and didn't realize it had milk and the ingredients weren't on the menu.  I asked him if there was milk, he said yes,  and I told him I can't have milk.  He proceeded to tell me that all boba drinks have milk and I asked him to please take it off my bill.  He literally grabbed the drink, turned around,  and started yelling to someone else in Vietnamese (I don't think he was saying nice things about me). He had a major attitude. I was a server for many years,  I understand that it is annoying when people come in close to closing time but you deal with it and give people good service and act profesonially  because those customers are paying your bills.

The food looks amazing, and the pastry case rivaled many other coffee shops I've been to.   I was able to try a double short latte with almond milk. I settled for almond because they don't have soy, which I know is a controversial milk somehow, but hey whatever I like it. The scone I had was quite delicious, but a tiny bit dry if you ask me. Considering I was there at 9 a.m. only an hour after they opened, I would have hoped for a more moist scone. However, I could still get the flavors from it which were lemon and Thyme.

"We've eaten at Cheeburger Cheeburger several times over the years and our experienced is mixed--good sometimes, less satisfactory others.  I stopped by for lunch the other day, mostly because the Mexican place in the same shopping center was closed.  The cheeseburger was pretty good this time.  Their method is that you choose the cheese and then as many toppings as you want.  It's a nice system.  They also have good fries and onion rings, although I didn't get any this time since I was alone and not all that hungry.  I did splurge on a milkshake (frappes from my Boston days).  They make them in lot of flavors and feature different kinds of mix-ins.  I got a yummy Butterfinger one!  Here was the problem: they will only cook the burgers medium or more.  This really infuriates me because I like my burgers medium rare.  And excuse me, but I think that I should be able to get them the way I want them, even if I have to sign some kind of waiver that I won't sue them.  Here's the pisser: when it came, their version of medium was a perfectly cooked medium rare.    The server I had was TERRIBLE.  Really, one of the worst service experiences I've ever had.  She was very officious about the medium rare/medium thing and from then on practically dropped everything on my table.  I usually don't tell servers how I feel if they do not do a good job--conflict avoidance at all costs--but this one was so awful that I actually told her what I felt.  I informed her that since she's working for tips that being unpleasant to her customers is not really a winning strategy for making money.

"Most of the Thai food we Americans are familiar with and have eaten comes from Southern Thailand. However, Fork & Stix, a small restaurant quietly located on Delmar Loop, serves Northern Thai Cuisine which is surprisingly much different than the average menu items found at your local Southern Thai restaurant.  One of the major differences between Northern and Southern Thai cuisine is the rice. Instead of Jasmine rice used in the South, North Thailand serves what is called sticky rice. To paint a picture, the texture of sticky rice is similar to the rice that's stuck to the bottom of the cooker when not enough water is used, except it's not burnt. It's definitely different, but it still tastes really good.   But hypothetically, if I had to choose one item off this menu to eat for the rest of my life, it would be this Thailand street food called Muu Ping. This dish consists of sweetly marinaded grilled pork skewers with a coconut glaze on top. Out of all the items I ordered, this was by far the tastiest. If you're looking for a noodle dish then go with the Khao Soi which was named one of Saint Louis's must try dishes by Riverfront Times a couple years back.  Last but not least, the Chicken Pad Thai (everyone knows what this is). Honestly, the only negative about this place was this meal. I didn't like it at all. The taste was clearly different than all the pad thai dishes I've had in my lifetime, and it wasn't for the better. The difference could be due to the fact that this is a Northern Thai restaurant. Therefore, different ingredients may have been used, but I wasn't a fan. However, try it for yourself though because you might like it.  As of 9 July 2017, this restaurant has made its way into my Top 5 Asian restaurants to eat because of all the delicious food (excluding the Pad Thai). I probably never would of had a chance to try such unique and wonderful dishes unless I bought a plane ticket to Chiang Mai.

"Omg. Something happened to my favorite little India hole in the wall. One of my favorite items to get is their vegetarian soup. This with some of their nann flat bread is the best way to start the dinner meal.  But something changed. The soup had a lot of unidentifiable items and bits of food. My partner said it looked as if they may have used some of the leftovers from the appetizers. I'm afraid she might be right as there were a lot of starchy bits throughout. It was hard to discern any veggies except for the frozen ones I had as a child &  grew up avoiding!  The nann hard a very strange texture. Hard to describe, except they had put some kind of filler in the flour to make it lighter. It didn't work for me or my partner. Just a odd unexpected surprise.   We also ordered the sampler plate for samosas, pakoras and a few other delights. The samosas didn't show up on the plate. All the items on the sampler plate were heavier & oiler than I recalled. The sauces they put out were good.   Well, overall I left saddened of heart.

I'd never hat a skillet before and will do so from now on! Couldn't hardly eat my ""side"" of fluffy pancakes that came with.

"If I could give no stars I would. I went to this place on a recommendation of a coworker and I honestly wish I didn't waste my time. I went for a pedicure. They did not buff or file. My nails now look terribly uneven as a result. The polish job looked like it was performed by a 2nd grader and did not cover the nail with corners missed. I ended up asking them to just remove the polish so I could go home and fix it myself. I wish I saved myself the money, time, and hassle.

I've tried a couple appetizers like the fries with lobster and some of their soft pretzels with beer cheese. Both very good! But really, I love this place! The bartenders are always amazing and have great suggestions on drinks and shots! I like coming upstairs and being on the patio. They truly have something for everyone though. If you want to dance- there's a dance floor. They have tables to sit, relax and eat downstairs. Multiple bars full of an amazing beer selection on tap. There is always a decent amount of people inside without it feeling like it's too packed to even move. Hopefully sometime soon I'll make it to try the dinner menu. But if you want some fun before or after a game, definitely recommend stopping by here! One of my favorites at BPV.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"This is my first ever yelp review but I felt inclined to express how awful this place is. Absolutely miserable experience. To be fair, we actually never made it into our appointment so I can not speak to the quality of the doctors. It started when we called and scheduled our first appointment with them. They asked us to call my wife's former OBGYN, request her medical records and bring them in. So, I called her former doctor and they informed us that they could not send her records to us, instead the records request should come from her new doctors office. So I relayed the message and called A Place For Women and notified them that they needed to request the records from my wife's previous OBGYN. They responded that they could not do that because my wife was not a current patient. I said ""well they won't send records unless you request them, and you won't request them unless we have our first appointment, so there's nothing I can do."" The receptionist asked if I still wanted to keep the appointment and I said ""of course."" The receptionist calls me back and says she needs to speak to my wife because it's urgent and she can not discuss it with me. I said ""ok, of course"" and gave the phone to my wife. THEY LITERALLY TOLD HER THE EXACT SAME THING THEY TOLD ME!!! I called them back and told them not to ever do that again because it's a very underhanded thing to do (mommy/daddy game). We showed up to the office and filled out the records request form so that they could send it to my wife's previous OBGYN, this was approximately 2 weeks before our initial appointment. So today we show on time for our 9:00 am appointment and begin filling out all the paperwork. At 9:45 am they inform us that they requested the records but did not receive them and asked us if we wanted to reschedule our appointment, or keep the appointment but ""we won't be able to do much and we would still bill you."" They then continued by asking why I didn't call them to make sure THEY received the records!!!! Mind you, all of this conversation is taking place in the main lobby. Bottom line, this business lacks courtesy, professional and competence.",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 1.0

"After reading the below reviews, at least I know I am not alone in my disgust with this Advantage Rental Crap.  I, too, have a call in to this Terry.  Left a message- we shall see if I get a call back.  My husband and daughter went to pick up the car I reserved online through carrentals.com (never had a problem with them before btw).  It was supposed to be a midsize car.  All they had left was an SUV.  Instead of honoring the price in the reservation like EVERY OTHER PLACE I HAVE EVER RENTED FROM, they charged an extra $24 a day.  He couldn't leave and go to another agency because this place is a shuttle ride out in yahooville.  He said the whole thing was a hustle.  I called no less than four times to try and rectify this and was given the runaround.  Finally I talked to a ""Sam"" who told me to have him come into the office and they'd take care of it.  Well, when he did this, ""Sam"" denied ever speaking to me and refused to take care of the price, saying, ""you took the upgrade"".  The parking lot is not well lit so beware making note of the damage to the vehicle before driving off.

"Just had a super-disappointing customer service experience. I have been in 3 times in the past 2 weeks looking for a comfort, hybrid bicycle. Have not purchased a bike in 37 years. Wanted to give my business to a small store and not one of the chain stores. Every time I went into Guy's, I felt invisible.....including today, when I went in to buy a $600.00 bike that I put a deposit on several days ago. Everyone working there always seems really busy, so I just stood at the counter (for a while) waiting my turn, without so much as an acknowledgement (such as ""hi, someone will be right with you""). Dan, who sold me the bike, seemed extremely nice and knowledgeable, but was off today. He actually introduced me to a better bike than I was looking for. I test drove the bike and gave a deposit. Today, I really wanted someone to spend some quality time with me, to show me how everything works, as well as making sure the bike was ""fit"" correctly for me. The man who ""helped"" me had trouble with the brake assembly and getting the wheel on and off the bike. He was trying to show me how to do it, but it seemed like he really just wanted to get rid of me. I asked about being ""fit"" and he told me it wasn't necessary for the type of bike I purchased. Now I have a brand new bike with some features on it that I have no idea how to use. He took the front tire off to get it into the car, and I don't have a clue as to how to get it back onto the bike! I am sitting here considering returning this bike and purchasing it elsewhere. So very disappointed, especially after seeing how many people posted good things here.   Added 8-28-15: After being really upset by the whole experience, I decided to call and ask for a manager. Spoke to Chad who seemed like he really wanted to make things right.  So I went back today (with the bike). Same treatment as yesterday. Walked in the back door by the service area, past 3 or 4 people who work there (including the person who ""helped"" me yesterday)! Not a ""hello, can we help you"".....nothing. I walked to the front of the store, and no one was there, so I had to go back to the service area. You would think that MAYBE the guy who helped me yesterday would have recognized me (and you would be WRONG)! Chad was not in, but Suzanne took some time to teach me how to put the wheel and brakes back onto the front tire, as well as explaining the gear systems and making sure the seat was the correct height for me. She also told me that the store offers free maintenance classes the last Saturday of every month and recommended that I check them out. I appreciated that she helped me, but I am not changing my rating. This was overall, an uncomfortable experience that should have never happened. I spent time saving my money, researching what I was looking for and where to purchase it and I just feel like my business was not valued.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 1.0
"I have to say this is by far one of my favorite places to shop for groceries! The entrance is clean and always festive for the season, all of the employees are extremely helpful and friendly.

They have by far the most abundance of selections for organic, vegan, non-GMO, and the prepared food section is absolutely phenomenal! If you were looking for a healthy prepared option they have it, if you're looking for something hearty and fatty they have it, if you're looking for a scrumptious pastry Danish or bagel they have it! The selection in the prepared food section boggles my mind and makes me want to buy every last item!  One thing I really can appreciate is you can get order a sandwich and a glass of beer or wine at a classy bar in the middle of the store!

"It's a good burger with an unmistakably steak-like quality to it. Patties are kept very thick, which allows them to get a great char on the outside while getting the center to a nice medium (or MR if you're into that) while keeping it juicy, but it has the drawback of less surface area for char/seasoning.  Baked potato is a cool/quirky touch for a burger side, but was very good (though I did kind of miss my French fries).",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0

Claiming you have New York pastrami is a big claim you'd better be able to back it up.  I have had NY pastrami many times...Gandolfo's doesn't have it.     I called to get a credit for the $12 sandwich twice.  I left a message twice with some kid to have the manager call me.  They never did.

I ordered the chicken croquettes and my wife ordered the roast beef platter. When the plates came out I looked at them and was appalled. The roast beef was sliced cheap deli meat that literally looked like Alpo and the croquettes were beyond a shadow of a doubt a reheat.  When I called over management he looked at us like we were out of our minds, took the dishes and said to wait for our waitress. After 45 seconds of waiting we got up and proceeded to leave. I saw the waitress and explained what had happened and she was very apologetic and kind. I can tell you that she was extremely professional and did receive a tip based on the bill as it was not her fault.

"I get takeout from here frequently and just about everything is delicious! I shall offer you a synopsis of some of the items I have sampled.   Now, let's get this out of the way. Their pasta fagioli...not good! I'd think if you are naming your restaurant after this one thing that it would blow my tits off, but it didn't. It was quite bland, and I wouldn't recommend it at all. Good thing everything else is great! Their fried mozzarella is quite unique in that it is in a ball shape and smothered in sauce.  I like it like this but my boyfriend did not, so you decide. Also, their sauce/gravy is phenomenal. We randomly got clams casino one day and they were very good, I'd recommend these guys if you enjoy them.  For the main event, I've only ever ordered their hot sausage cacciatore dish because it is so good, and I know I love it so why try anything else. But this is one of the best Italian entrees I've ever had at a restaurant. And they give you quite a bit so you can enjoy it for a few days.  I also love their spumone dessert here for some reason.

"I found this on Yelp and had to add my comments.  Two of my favorite places are the Velvet Tango Room in Cleveland and Level in Annapolis, Maryland,  47 Scott seems to take the best of both those places and put them together.    I was there on a Tuesday night in July.  Not many people there.  However, when the UofA is back in session and it is cooler, I'd suggest reservations.  I am a Negroni fan, so I had the ""Dancehouse Queen"" cocktail to start.  It looks like a chick drink but tastes like a Mad Men type of cocktail.  I took a picture of the menu so I could buy those ingredients when I get back home.  But I know I could never replicate this incredible drink.  My starter was the mac-n-cheese with bacon.  Many places make mac-n-cheese.  This was very good, but could not be a signature dish.  If you there for the cocktails, this and another starter would suffice for a meal to sop up the liquor.  Like many other Yelp reviewers, I had the phyllo-wrapped chicken.  It was very good.  but the chicken breast was somewhat small, and there were a lot of potatoes and carrots (sorry mom, I still won't eat carrots).  But the sauce and spinach was a good complement to the dish.    The staff are very laid back without acting hipster.  Derek was my waiter and knew the menu quite well.    The decor is very NYC with metal and lighting.  It looks cold, but that is a good thing in the summer in Tucson!  I wasn't there for happy hour, but my bill was quite reasonable!  My only regret is I'm leaving Tucson tomorrow.  Otherwise, I'd go back the the speakeasy and check that out.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Upon a subsequent visit, the Iberico shoulder steak was once again magnificent. and the squash salad was a perfect starter.  However, be aware that the zuccotto cake Black Market is serving is not a traditional Italian cake; it is basically a 100% chocolate layer cake.  Having traveled in Italy extensively, a traditional chocolate zuccotto cake either 1) has chocolate glaze, not frosting, covering the top of the cake with a whip cream filling or 2) has a chocolate glaze, not frosting, with a relatively small portion of chocolate filling, not cake, coupled with a large amount of whipped cream filling.  This is a huge difference if you are pairing port, desert wine, etc. with the cake.   When I pointed this out to the waitress she got defensive and somewhat argumentative.  Certainly an immature and unprofessional response.  Especially given the age of the waitress I had today, there is no excuse for the display of immaturity that I witnessed. Unfortunately, as mentioned in my prior review, the standard of service at Black Market does not compliment the menu; in fact it detracts from the experience.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 2.0
"The ONLY reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because of the containers they have for their whipped shea butter. The shea butter is amazing and has done wonders for my eczema. I love all of the different scents BUT, they need bigger containers. The shea butter is whipped with different oils so as soon it hits the heat it liquifies.  I love the store, the products and the customer service. I'm from New Jersey so I travel to Germantown once every two months to stock up on what I need.  But I really truly like for them to get bigger and more durable containers for the shea butter.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 4.0

"Needed a quick place to get take-out on a rainy night around 7PM. Bareburger is right around the corner and we'd never tried it so figured ""why not?"". We ordered a County Fair ($12) and a Buttermilk Buffalo ($9). I was surprised that fries were not included, particularly at that price point. We asked for 2 orders, and the person on the phone suggested a ""share"" size and we unfortunately said ""sure"".   They said 15 minutes, so we waited 10 and then headed over. Went to pick-up at the restaurant (roughly 1/3 full) and waited nearly 15 minutes. Less than 5 minutes later, we're on the couch getting ready to dive in and we realize that not only are the fries cold, but both sandwiches as well. In addition, the ""share"" size was rather light on the fries - again, surprising considering that they were $6 and nothing more than fries in regular oil. The Buttermilk Buffalo had a tiny piece of chicken which left my fiancee craving more food at the end.  TLDR: Cold, overpriced, and underwhelming food. Overall, would never go back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"We had the pleasure of stopping by The Family Wash/Garage Coffee Co. on 9/15/17 for breakfast and started planning a return visit before we even left. It's that good. - The atmosphere is cool, laid-back, and similar to a neighborhood country diner from a past era.  - The coffee menu board (blackboard with chalk writing) catches your eye as you walk through the front door and leaves you only feeling bummed that you can't try everything on their espresso menu in one sitting. My orange mocha (with dairy substitute) was both pretty and tasty.  - The food menu appearance, like the decor across the board, was cool and reminiscent of something from the 60s. I had the Go-To biscuit with the semolina-spinach biscuit and veggie pattie and it was FANTASTIC. The portions were more than enough to fill a hungry adult, but not filled with the typical tasteless grease common of diners.  - The restrooms were spacious, clean, and well ventilated. - The servers were all approachable, personable, informative, and each seemed happy to be there and truly to take pride in serving customers such great grub. - The only disappointments from our visit were that we (inadvertently) arrived too early in the day for the live entertainment, which we gathered was a regular occurrence and that we were too stuffed to try more menu items or make a dent in their HUGE tap & spirits list.

"Rockfire Grill is #60 on Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat in 2016, is the #3 Hot and New restaurant of 2016, and has 4.5 stars with close to 700 reviews so I really don't need to convince anyone that the food here is good... but I'm going to do it anyway.  Space: The location isn't that large so it isn't the best for big groups of people. As other reviewers have stated, it has more of a lunch vibe because it is fast casual (order at the counter). Nonetheless, I came here with a group of 10 for dinner and I'd do it all over again. We managed to get some tables together and I'd gladly eat their delicious burgers at any time of the day.  Prices: It is pretty darn cheap! The prices are incredibly fair and they even offer a Yelp deal for 10% off your first visit. With the discount, my cheddar burger and side order of fries came out to $8.65.  Food: I'm just going to get this out of the way before getting to the juicy part: a cousin of mine ordered the margherita pizza and said it tasted like elementary school pizza. I didn't try it so I can't give my input, but I'd recommend just sticking with what they're famous for--burgers. Now, speaking of Rockfire's burgers... THEY ARE AMAZING! What's so special about them, you ask? Let's break it down:   1) Instead of using classic buns, they use freshly baked flatbread buns. The flatbread has some cheese melted on top that adds a subtle, but delicious extra component of taste to the burger. Also, the flatbread is folded to create a pocket for the patties and toppings, which means the backside of the burger is closed. Yes ladies and gentlemen, that means nothing will be sliding out the back of your burger and all the flavors will be contained inside the flatbread. I'm a huge fan of the flatbread concept; it is a huge plus in both the taste and practicality departments.   2) The patties in my burger pleased me in both quantity and quality. Rockfire Grill is the only place I've ever seen that uses two patties by default! They definitely don't skimp on the amount of meat provided. The meat is also on point in flavor. Even though there was cheese and sauce on my burger, I could still distinctly taste the well seasoned and perfectly cooked meat.  3) The house made spread on the burger was top notch and they added the perfect amount: just enough to taste it, but not to the point where it masks the flavor of the meat.  Simply stated, Rockfire Grill makes an outstanding burger that isn't lacking in any department. Oh and the fries are pretty darn good as well. Be sure to try out their dipping sauces if you order fries (which you should).  Overall: Do yourself a favor and try out their burger and fries as soon as possible. It won't break the bank and your taste buds will be thanking you immensely.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

We ordered the Arigato roll, Dracula roll, premium 7 nigiri sushi and a spicy tuna hand roll.  The rolls were just okay. Nothing different or special about them.  We've paid less for much better rolls.  But the service was really good.  The fish was really fresh. The sushi was tasty.  This place is popular and gets packed really fast.

"I'll get my comment about the general lack of vegetarian food out of the way.  There wasn't much.  I actually had to ask the waitress what my options were.  There were a few, but most of them involved ordering _______ but minus the meat.  I decided on the broccoli rabbe and ceci bean sandwich.  I was happily surprised.  It's an open faced sandwich of deliciousness served with french fries.  My friends all got the fried chicken which apparently was amazing.  I took their word for it.  The inside of the restaurant was nice and spacious.  There was no wait for a table for 5 of us during happy hour.  Drinks were good and on special.  Service was friendly and attentive.  My only other complaint is that it was cold.  I mean really really COLD in there.  As much as I hated doing it, I had to eat dinner in my puffy down coat.

"Just dreadful.  Ordered a hot corned beef sandwich that should have come with coleslaw.  It was a few slices of room temperature meat on dry light rye bread.  Bread wasn't toasted, not even a bit of mayo on the bread, some bland chips and the slaw never happened.  Not even mustard on the table which usually goes with corned beef.  Wasn't socially in a situation to send it back but noticed other person I dined with ate barely anything.  She had chicken tenders that looked seriously overdone.  Took half the sandwich home.  Added condiments and grilled it and it was fine, but I was paying someone out back at Cosmos to do the same thing and they obviously didn't care enough to bother.

"If you want speed & efficiency, this facility is a very good place to undergo endoscopes, colonoscopies, as well as procedures in the fields of urology, podiatry, orthopedics, gynecology, general surgery, orthopedics, pain management, plastic surgery, ophthalmology, & other specialities. On Fletcher Avenue just west of Bruce B. Downs Blvd, there is plenty of parking.  The PROCESS: (1) You'll enter the building and be asked to be seated. Soon after, you'll meet for a handful of questions w/ the individual who greeted you upon entry. (Chris' British accent was great!) (2) After being directed to wait in the large lobby area, you'll meet w/ him again to sign papers & arrange payment. (3) After a ten minute lobby wait, I was called back to a small room. There I met two nurses & the anesthesiologist. (4) After being prepped for surgery (& waiting 40 min), another nurse took me to a nearby hallway to wait some more; however, the wait was short lived & she remained w/ me as we conversed about her children. (5) Next it was a wheeled trip down the hall & into the room where my procedure would begin. (6) From there it was another ride to the two patient recovery room just a few doors down. (A curtain separates the patients). (7) After approximately 20 minutes, I sat in a wheelchair & was then quickly rolled out the side door to my driver's awaiting vehicle.   The system used at this ambulatory center is one of precision w/o deviation; everything operates in rhythm. There truly is little deviation to the type of assembly line procedural system that is employed here-- Bing. Bang. Boom. In and out.   The BIG POSITIVES: 1) the steps from the moment you enter the building are fast & like clockwork. One patient after the other. Snap snap. You should get in & out quickly unlike most centers where delays prolong a haphazard experience. (2) the online pre-surgical prep is extensive, but necessary and easy to complete. The system even saves your entries if you want to answer the multitude of questions over a series of days/weeks. (3) Gretchen in Recovery. She was born for the job-- kind, friendly & professional, and even humorous. She put me right at ease & happily answered my questions.  The NEGATIVES: (1) The waiting room is VERY cold, so bring a thick sweater or a jacket. (2) The two nurses who worked with me in the prep room were only semi friendly. It would have been nice of them to at least smile, introduce themselves, & to warn me when they were going to jab my finger w/ a needle then shove another needle in my hand. I don't particularly like those types of surprises. (3) the three members of the medical personnel in the actual procedural room NEVER spoke to me upon entry. Silence! Uncomfortable silence! The younger woman in black (on 2/12/19) not ONCE spoke to me as she worked on me. No words. Nothing. Zippo. She came across as cold. A man eventually introduced himself and asked me a question or two before telling me to lie on my side. The doctor entered (he was genuinely friendly, thank God) then the procedure began. Only the woman in black didn't bother to tell me it was beginning! I felt a warm, stinging sensation in my hand, which apparently knocked me out. (Like w/ the needle sticks, it would have been REALLY nice to know what was coming.)   Except for the doctor, there wasn't one truly compassionate staff member in that room, & that is unacceptable. I was essentially a nameless person to the three people in the room w/ the doctor and me. Although the speed of service was very much appreciated, the unfriendliness wasn't acceptable. Acknowledging the patient (me) & letting him/her know what to expect would not detract from getting her (me) out quickly.   THE REASON FOR 4 STARS -- the efficiency of service like nothing I've experienced at this type of medical facility until now; the efficiency of the online pre-surgical ""paperwork;"" and Gretchen in Recovery. Phenomenal nurse! Now if only management would require each medical staff member to introduce him/herself upon meeting the patient AND require him/her to tell the patient ahead of time what is going to occur. Perhaps Gretchen can train them on how to be friendly, but that unfortunately is an innate quality that should be present within anyone in this line of work.  Yes, it's great that you operate like a well greased machine that gets people in & out quickly, but servicing ALL of the patient's needs in the process is essential. Communication must not be sacrificed for efficiency.",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 4.0

The buffalo tacos are our favorite and the cauliflower is cooked to a perfect texture. The traditional tacos are more filling than the cauliflower tacos but lack a strong taste. As a starter, we tried the empanadas. They came out very warm with a beautiful orange color and a beef and cheese substitute inside.

We ran into the bike rental area and came face to face with a native hipster decked out in dirty hair, thick eyeliner, and the terrible attitude. We also noticed that she was stoned out of her mind. I asked if we could take our 5 and 8 year old on any of the bikes and she responded with ""like isn't it obvious""?. I was thrown, I often like to waste my breath and not know the answer to something. I told her ""no it's not obvious otherwise I wouldn't be asking"" and we began to walk off. She finally got up and started to show me where the kids could sit and continued to say ""it is so obvious"". My bad girl, my bad.   The next day we went into the lobby to get some Starbucks and mind you my kids and I just got back from the beach and came back with sand in our cracks and wind whipped hair. We stood at the register where there was no line and were passed by several employees that did not acknowledge us. I finally got the attention of yet another passing employee and asked if we could order. She said ""you'll have to wait for the barista"". I said I had been and that we'd been there for longer than five minutes without being acknowledged. She gave me a dirty look and said ""fine, what can I get for you"". I ordered and asked if she had stevia. She said ""what is stevia"", and I was speechless. I asked for cream and she was like ""half and half right""?....... I almost left but I really needed coffee.   No one was very friendly, no one approachable but the place was gorgeous! The pool was nice and there was wait service and drinks poolside. The rooms were ok. There was no free breakfast, no robes in the closet, and the digital key didn't work.   Overall I give the place two stars because it is beautiful. But the way my family was treated means they made a big mistake, huge! We will not stay here again.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 2.0

"this restaurant is very unassuming from the outside. i'm not going to lie, I would not stop in here judging from the outside. it's in a strip mall and not in the best spot and it's just not a great location in general.  i'm so glad we come here though. all the staff is so friendly, accommodating, and attentive. I have been here a few times now and it is always PACKED inside, no matter what time of day it is. if that isn't a sign that it's bomb, I don't know what else is.  the sushi here is so good and super fresh, but this review is about the ramen. we came in specifically for ramen a couple weeks ago. they have a few different kinds but the chashu broth was my favorite choice- it's so flavorful and porky and good. I got grilled chicken in mine. I am just not a huge fan of sliced pork in my ramen. my husband got it and loved it.  I got the combo that came with the california roll. we both left stuffed.   lastly, we had our toddler with us so I ordered him a side of garlic noodles which was like $3 and a huge plate of seasoned ramen noodles with some carrots and celery. he ate the entire plate!   looking forward to comping back again and again. they have a big menu, so there is a lot to discover here!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Arnand's, you are taking advantage of your customers. $27+ for a single breast of chicken with no additional vegetable, potato or anything? Highway robbery.   My party had 3 chicken breast dishes, for a total of $83+ before tax.....do you know what a rip off that is?? There wasn't even artistry or very much flavor in the food. Just a huge disappointment.   If your food had imagination, flavor or talent......I would be happy to pay that. I just get upset paying overly inflated prices for something I could make better at home!! You must know this.......people go out to restaurants to have things they cannot or do not know hot to make at home.   You are supposed to be legendary.

"UPDATE: We originally gave Sunda a 5 STAR review for their happy hour and I wanted to update this now that we have also tried items on their main dinner menu. It's still 5 STAR!  We tried 5 different dishes on their main dinner menu and were wowed by all of it. We had the Brussels Sprouts, Tiger Shrimp, oxtail pot stickers, escolar nigiri and wagyu and spicy tuna crispy rice. The crispy rice was by far out favorite of the 5 but we would order any of it again without hesitation!  Also want to say that the service remains amazing and they recognize us and remember our drinks every time we go in!  Previous (happy hour) review below....  Went in for happy hour and it was awesome. We sat at the bar and ordered from the happy hour menu.  $6 specialty cocktails, we tried them both. Both were delicious and worth the price for sure. The bar tenders were prompt (there were 3 guys working back there) and we were also served water as soon as we sat down. I'm still surprised so many places in Nashville make you ask for water, that it is always so nice when you are given it without asking. Starts the meal off on the right foot!  We also orders the tail of two tunas roll from the happy hour menu, also $6 (usually $15 not on happy hour), and it was great! Eight pieces of sushi and it tasted really fresh. For what it's worth, they also have really good / spicy food wasabi.  The inside is big, plenty of table seating and the bar is also pretty large. They have a small outside patio if you want to people watch while you enjoy your sushi.  We didn't order anything off the main menu this time around, but want to come back and try some of their specialty rolls and also that fried rice (forget what it's called but has lobster in it and sounds delicious).  In total, we spent $25 including taxes and 22% tip for 2 cocktails and a sushi roll. Really can't beat that.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"My co-workers and I had gone here about three times.  The last time I went needless to say would be my last.  There was a good size COCKROACH swimming in our food.  There was no apology made.  Waitress just took the food away without saying a word.  We were the ones apologizing for having to leave.  In my view, if I get a hair or fly in my food, although it's disgusting, I would probably stay if they re-made my food.  But if there's a cockroach in my food, that is a sign of dirtiness.    If you like an extra crunch with disease carrying bugs in your pita then this is the place for you.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Love & Honey Fried Chicken was a last-minute pitstop we made after an overnight trip in Philly before heading back to NYC and for sure, it was a good one. There are plenty of options for fried chicken lovers from having them in sandwich form to wings and drumsticks and tenders. In addition, they offer sides like cornbread muffins and tater tots as well as homemade desserts like cookies and pies!  I got the OG fried chicken sandwich, which contains a buttermilk fried chicken breast with spicy ranch slaw on top in between two toasted buns. What I love about the sandwich is that even though it uses white meat, I couldn't even tell because the chicken was still juicy and moist unlike other fried chicken sandwiches that also use white meat. Additionally, the seasoning was great, as the chicken was drizzled with a little bit of hot honey before being served, giving it this sweet and spicy kick. The sandwich also kept together very well as I ate it, which was great, as it wasn't too messy. The tater tots are also a must-have, as they are the perfect complement to your chicken. They honestly do not need sauce or ketchup at all, as they are perfectly seasoned with the right amount of salt to keep you wanting more while not feeling too bad about yourself for indulging in so many fried foods.  Also, I got to try my friend's pecan pie and that was easily the best pecan pie I've ever had. It was nutty and sweet, but not to the point where it was too much. If they served whole pies, it's definitely worth a consideration to bring home for Thanksgiving.  Overall, I would definitely come here if I had a hankering for fried chicken and was in Philly. The fried chicken is juicy and the tater tots make for a scrumptious snack. Just make sure to come on an empty belly.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I never really write reviews. Even my ladyfriend bugs me for not speaking out to waitstaff (if a dish I ordered was incorrect, if I thought something was subpar). Live and let live, right? I get it. I worked in the food industry and dealt with everything from the bridge-and-tunnel crowd to the downright snooty. I'm understanding overall. We're all human. Places have off days. Most places don't pay a living wage and staff can't survive on tips alone. World is going to pot. Yada yada yada That being said...  My beau and I had been trying to get reservations for this place for a while. People we know say it's the best thing since sliced baguette. The only spots available were always 4:30 or 10:00, if that. Damn! Place must be good! I'm not European so I'm not eating at midnight, and I'm not 100 years old so I'm not eating at 4:30. I waited and waited for an opening for weeks, in order to secure a spot for my boo's birthday. It took time and patience but I got a 5:00 slot.   Wm had sent me an email and three texts in regards to our upcoming meal, within the 72 hour build up. I'd never had an establishment hit me up so much before a meal so the hype was building. Their contact would say politely, something to the effect of, ""...get here by 5 please...contact us if you're running late..."" I hurried my sweetheart along annoyedly, saying quips like ""Mr. Mulherin is tapping his foot, waiting for us!"" and ""He won't seat us if we're five minutes late!"" Right before dinner, rushing her out of our coffee place, the barista told us Mulherin was ""the best place to eat in Philadelphia"". Damn! Double damn! A barista is cultured! And she lived in New York! Can't be wrong!  We get there a few minutes before 5. We then wait for fifteen-twenty minutes. They wanted us to wait in a tiny, cold vestibule with the rest of the people who had reservations. The tables weren't ready yet. Okay, either this was a part of the charm (like waiting for Pizza Beddia--it tastes better if you're slightly annoyed) or they were running a bit late as the weather was bad and they were short staffed? Just running behind? Always this way? Okay, I can deal. We waited, sat, read the menu, then ordered...  -Cheeses: Cheeses were good, but they didn't give us enough bread. We even looked to the couples around us and they both got more bread! Both standard bread, and bread specifically for cheeses. Did I have a stamp on my forehead that said ""poor person""? I wore my best flannel for this meal. What gives?  -Brussel sprouts: Al dente-ish sprouts served with crunchy pine nut topping and stracciatella. The cheese and the sprouts didn't taste like anything but brussel sprouts. The pine nut topping was barely noticed. I don't know if al dente was what they were going for. I know stracciatella doesn't have the strongest taste but this had no taste. I could have baked sprouts from the Farmer's Market, thrown panko on top and picked up some nice, runny cheese from DiBruno Bro's instead. Bummmmmmer.  -Pork ribs: My boo usually doesn't like ribs but since our barista friend said it was hand cooked by God and served by Jesus, we figured we should order it. It was 80-90% gristle. No joke. Sauce was pretty dope but you can't eat gristle even if it's dope sauce. Double bummer.  -Bucatini all'Amatriciana: Wanted something a bit different from usual Italian fare we'd have otherwise. Noodle was cool but sauce had no distinct taste. And there was only one piece of guanciale!  -Beef ravioli: Chef special. It was ""good"". It was the best dish we had but at that point we were pretty soured.  -Flaky pastry thing with creme inside and fancy icing on top  -Cup of creme dessert thing with little crunch balls on top  The stars were deserved to the waitstaff and more specifically our waiter who was great and super knowledgable (guy with an accent--shout's out, Accent Guy). It was also a cool building with a fireplace, and the desserts and beer were good. But I don't go to fancy restaurants strictly for booze and sweets.  The reason the review was written is (with 20% tip) the check was about $150. If I'm dropping that kinda cash I expect better. There's a higher standard here. High enough that I also just gave them a half-hour of my time to write this review. I don't want to pay a fifth of my paycheck just to have a couple beers, desserts and one ""good"" dish. Maybe you, the reader, should get the special $130 ribeye? I just can't afford that. But I guess this is what's coming to my fair Verona. I guess Wm is more for the incoming Comcast crowd. (Odd seeing it across from the El Bar.) I'd rather just go to Little Nona's or Square Pie, or hell, go to Olive Garden and have unlimited breadsticks and iceberg lettuce.

They get some good bands here but this is probably one of my least favorite venues to see live music in New Orleans.  The service is usually very slow and the drink prices are too expensive for New Orleans.  It can also get crazy crowded and the poorly designed venue has plenty of bad spots for watching the band.  I used to have a lot of friends that were members of the Foundation Room so I used to go in there pretty often but almost everybody I know has dropped their memberships because the House of Blues just doesn't deliver what we expect in New Orleans.

The flavors of the food we ordered were pretty nice, but this is definitely not the place to come for healthy food, as the calories listed on the menu for each dish are quite significant.

"I really like the Pi chain in general, which is the only reason why I'm not giving 1 star for this review; however, tonight was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had.   No employees were rude, but the service and time was awful. Not just for our party of two, but for literally everyone in the entire basement level, which the restaurant as a whole was about half full. People dining in and carrying out were backed up waiting forever. Supposedly only one of three ovens was working, but I heard a server give a completely different reason for the slow service. Ironically, it was National Pizza Day. Our salad took 20-30 minutes to come out, and the pizza was another hour after that. When it came out, it was about half as warm as it should have been.   I can chalk up any place having a bad night, but based on reviews I've read for the past several months, this seems to be a trend. This location is moving buildings soon, so hopefully that will spur a comeback. Our server did give us half off our bill, but the total 2 hour experience wasn't worth it.

"I was excited to try Saffire.  I love the location, I loved the interior.  I stopped by on a Sunday afternoon and they were fairly busy.  The hostess offered me a table tucked away in the corner of the entrance way.  Which says to me, your server will forget about you.  I even mentioned this.  But since my only other option was to wait or sit at the bar, I took the table.  And of course, my server forgot about me.  The lovely hostess was observant enough to notice that I had been forgotten and offered to bring me a beverage and then find my missing server.  I opted for a Blackberry Mountain Tea.  It was okay.  So, Mr. Poof Hairstyle finally makes his way to my table to take my order.  And lucky for me, he never came to my table, again.  I got a Crab Cake Salad.  It was so good.  Loved it.  The crab cakes were served on a bed of arugula, with shaved fennel, red onions, avocado and cracked mustard vinaigrette.    I am a firm believer that you can have the most incredible interior, the best food, but it all means nothing, if you don't have adequate service.  Mr. Poof was also serving the table next to me.

"Oh Farmer's Almanac...   This is a large shop at The Legends at Sparks Marina that has a lot of what my mom would call ""dust catchers"".   Overpriced dust catchers at that!  However, if you know someone that is collecting roosters or you're looking for a gift for someone or want something kind of kitschy, this is the place to go.  And it is fun to stop in and have a browse.  Mostly.  There are a few exceptions which include:   1) aggressive staff that hounds you when you look at the Disney Jim Shore figurines either because a) they want to sell it to you or b) they're nervous your children are going to break something.  Listen, my kids have been drilled they are not to touch anything and to only ""look with their eyes"" and if they DO break something, I will pay for it. GET OFF MY BACK.   2) the fragrance.  They scent the entire store with... licorice.  Yes, the whole store smells like black licorice.  Which, maybe some people dig that smell.  I'm not one of those people.  I almost feel like they should hand out breathing masks at the door.  Or hey, maybe not even scent the store in the first place!  There's a novel idea.   3) Prices.  They have some cute, unique things in this store but so much of it is so very overpriced.  We generally only make a purchase when something goes in sale, unfortunately.  Hitting this place up after Christmas for goodies for next year is always a good plan.    All in all, we really like this shop.  But they need to reign in their staff some (I once was barked at for taking a cell phone picture of a sign I wanted to send to a friend, to see if she liked it before purchasing.  I was rudely told they do not allow pictures to be taken in the store.

"I feel so bad writing a negative review. I wanted to love this place and did up until the food started coming. Let me start by saying all the staff couldn't of been nicer. But that's were the good things ended.  There were three of us and we ordered two appetizers to share. One came right away, it was a nice soup. The other a mushroom risotto was nowhere to be found. After about twenty minutes the waitress asked about the risotto. When we said it never came she rushed off to the kitchen. It arrived about a minute later ice cold. As we were eating it with our plates in front of us the main courses arrived. the staff clumsily pushed all the risotto out of the way and put down our food.  All three main courses were pretty bad in their own special ways. The pirogi were supper grease and over salted. The fried chicken was actually a chicken cutlet without a bone, plus the side of mac and cheese was again ice cold and the duck confit was so salty the skin had to be removed just to eat it.  The desert which was a chocolate cake, turned out to be a single disk of some cake with a bit of cream of some sorts dropped on the side of it. Not what we saw coming out of the kitchen just a few minutes earlier to other tables. Don't even know what to make of that one.  The place seems very popular and I'm sure our horrible experience and review wont change that.

"Been here 3 times.   Staff isn't knowledgeable about menu. I am a vegan and had been told that some items were vegan to later find out that they weren't. Many of us have dietary restrictions for spiritual and religious reasons and it's disappointing that the staff wasn't sensitive to it.   Unfortunately, the last time I was there, we saw a roach on the wall after we finished eating. We pointed it out and the waiter squished it in front of us to ""fix"" the situation. He really should had comped our meal.   I've been in the food and service industry for 20 years and haven't never had roaches in a single place I've worked.  Why? Because they all used exterminators to prevent it from happening.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"The Kettle & Grille is just your standard diner, nothing special other than the odd location.  While the breakfast food was decent (ok pancakes and pretty good crispy bacon), our server was pretty slow and it took over 25 minutes for our simple breakfast to come out.  The place wasn't even that crowded.  Price wise, it was reasonable and they did have a fair amount of options.

"Maybe this place changed hands since my last review. A clueless girl answers the phone and I said I wanted a small pie, thin crust with my favorite toppings, well done. No problem. I get there and she is outside, smoking and perusing her phone. Inside, my pizza was being cut, it was about 10 inches, thick sicilian crust which I hate, gooy cheese and tasteless sauce, and he admitted it was pre-made and they dump some topping on the pie and warm it up, which is why they didn't make it fresh and thin like I asked. Why give the customer what he wants, anyway? I also asked for 2 slices with sausage for my wife. He grabs two slices of plain that looked like they had been sitting there for who knows how long, dumps what looks like malted milk balls on top, and covers it with some cheese. In the oven it goes for a makeover. This had to be the worst pie I have ever had, and threw it out after a couple of bites.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Finally went to Baiju for the first time today for some after work drinks with a friend. We were seated right away and they had a special going on, for Tuesday Baos (2 for $7). I had an Old Fashioned to drink, which was well made. I also had the Deviled eggs, and the Red braised pork Baos from the special. All of the food was outstanding. We were so impressed we also tried a special shot made with Hennessy and a green tea chaser which really got my attention. I'm looking forward to coming back here again with a group of friends and trying more food and drink. Seems like a great place to hang out for a bit and enjoy the ambiance. Last note is I was really pleased that they had traditional chop sticks that appeared to be made from red wood, like a set you would actually find around a dinner table in China.

You're not saving money staying here because the charge a resort fee, so choose more wisely and stay somewhere else.  Sadly, we ate at the buffet that night. I took what I thought was a safe bet: a slice of pizza. My first bite left me wondering if I should spit it out. Something was definitely ""off"" here. That's when I checked under the cheese and found absolutely raw dough. Yes, our waiter assured us this happens all the time because the pizza is frozen. So nice of him to let us know how much they care about serving poor quality food. I'll certainly never go here again.",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 1.0
"My wife and I tried this cozy BYOB on the advice of our son and his GF on a Sunday evening. We had 16:45 reservations only to be surprised to learn the restaurant did not actually open until 17:00, so be aware when utilizing Open Table to secure your reservations. From that somewhat choppy start, We could not have been more pleased. From the attentive service to the exquisite dishes, we could not have been more pleased. Starting with the Mussels Casino and very tasty but HOT long hots, the evening flowed seamlessly. The waitress, Andrea?, made sure each entrée on the $ 40.00 tasting menus (best bet), arrived perfectly on time, after we had finished the previous course. The owner stopped by our table several times to inquire about our experience, but was far from intrusive, really made us feel he genuinely cared about our dinning experience. The freshly prepared gnocchi with marinara just melted in my mouth and my wife raved about the three cheese lobster mac and cheese. Honestly everything was prepared perfectly and we had to take some home because the portions were rather large. Suffice to say, L'Oceano was two new ""YUGE""! fans.. lol",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I stopped by Paladar for a quick bite before a paint night across the street. The happy hour sign on my walk from the car caught my eye and brought me in!   On the way inside I noticed the valet parking and a delicious jar of complementary watermelon water in the waiting area. I tried some on the way out and it was delicious! Nice touch!   I only ordered a quick appetizer. I asked the bar tender for a suggestion and she recommended the queso fondito. I took the suggestion and asked for no jalapeños. Five minutes later my plate of hot cheese arrived but had to be sent back because jalapeños covered the top of queso. It was only a short wait for new order.   I was so excited to take a bit with their home made chips. The first bite was good! The cheesy was gooy and pulled beautifully! The problem is moments later that wasn't the case. The cheese got congealed and the chips would break when you tried to scoop some up. I think if this was served in something that could retain the heat better the melted goodness would have lasted longer. I used a fork to pick at the chorizo at too and ended up giving up. The cheese was also very bland. There were fresh herbs on the cheese but it just didn't have much of a taste.  This could have been because I didn't have the jalapeños so i blame myself for this. Additionally, there were large chunks of garlic that weren't really expected that were strong enough that I asked for a mint with my check, which they didn't have.  While I sat at the bar I observed others getting their food and drinks. The food did look beautiful and the drinks were muddled and poured with care. The decor was also very cool to observe. I think that I'd definitely give it another try when I'm in the area and can enjoy one of their craft cocktails and some tacos.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

He never came back to the table to check on us, nothing, he stayed about as far away as possible. When he finally came by to see if we wanted dessert my husband tried to tell him about the missing item, but he didn't want to hear it. He said he would be back, my husband had to almost grab him to get him to stop for a second and listen. He finally brought us the bill and 3 pretty awful pieces of chocolate covered peanuts?????? Was this suppose to make up for the lousy service? I think not. I would go back because the food was wonderful, but if he was my waiter again? No, would request a different section of the restaurant.  We were at table 4 and I think his name was Tyne. If he is your waiter, run!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Upon check- in the hotel charged my card twice. They took out an extra $650 out of my checking account.  I advised them of this error as soon as my bank called to ask me about the double charges. The account controller "" looked into it"" and then needed to call my bank with me present. My bank explained this is not something they can release on their end and have them instruction on how to get this resolved.  They did not do it. I have been to the front desk daily and called asking for updates. Today, the day before checkout, the GM told me that there is nothing they can do on their end. I will have to file a fraudulent charge with my bank and wait for their process to refund the money.  They have had my money for 4 days and he said this process could take up to 5 days more.  I am absolutely disappointed in their lack of professionalism and apparent disregard for any timeliness for this to be resolved. This was supposed to be a 5 day relaxing weekend and instead I've had to follow up on this issue daily.  Everything happening has been chaotic. The atmosphere in the lobby is not relaxing. People running everywhere and just very much the opposite of what this hotel "" appeared"" online. I will not stay here ever again.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 1.0

I wasn't happy with the fact that I had to pay $20 more which they knew exactly what The problem was.

"I made a walk in order around 2pm. This is strictly a take-out business with no dining area. The cashier lady who took my order didn't seem interested in making me feel welcome. My order was ready in 10min. No utensils were provided which I think is absurd. Don't forget to ask for utensils with your order.   I ordered Fried Dumplings appetizer, Sesame Chicken lunch special with white rice and Wonton Soup included. Can of soda. $11  Wonton Soup - Definitely slightly above average for take out. A bit too salty for my personal taste, but it has a strong bullion like it was homemade quality. It doesn't taste watered down. The small container came with 2 dumplings and a third smaller dumpling. The wrapper was overly soft, but the meat was decent. Would not purchase again. 3.5/5  Fried Dumplings appetizer - So far these are the best fried dumplings I've tried from a Chinese takeout. The wrappers are fried nicely, they're not too soft of soggy. They are crispy on one side. Their meat portion is very generous. Will purchase again. 5/5  Sesame Chicken - This dish is lacking. The sauce leans toward the sour/tangy side instead of a bold slightly sweet flavor. It tasted like I was eating sweet and sour chicken sprinkled with sesame seeds. The sauce was also very viscous. When it cooled down a bit I felt like I was eating gelatin with dry rice because the sauce would not mix. I prefer a less viscous sauce. 4 broccoli pieces seems more appropriate than the two provided. Would not purchase again. 2/5  Wonton strips - I love wonton strips that are freshly made. But these are the thin kind that come from a commercial bag. Disappointed! 1/3  Vegetable lo mein - (purchased next day) I think it's good. It's not bland and it's not too salty. Not too oily and not too dry either. The broccoli is cooked perfectly, slightly crunchy not soft. The shredded celery is a nice touch. The noodles were cooked just right. 5/5.    Overall 3/5 - This place is average for your Chinese take out joint. The food seems like a hit or miss, but I would go back for the dumplings.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Not really sure what all the hype is about. I was not that impressed with my trip to Raising Cane's. My experience may have just been a ""fluke"" but it happened and I should write about it.   I was out running errands one evening after work and by the time I was done I needed so get some food. I was going to go inside, but there wasn't much parking to choose from and the lot itself was confusing so I just decided to go through the drive thru. There were a few cars ahead of me and so I knew it would take some time. I had no idea it would take 10 minutes before I could even order! Unbelievable. Anyways, when I did order I asked for the caniac combo since I knew my fiance would be hungry as well and I could share with him when I got home.   By the time I got to the window the girl on the inside was just looking all confused and not sure what she was doing. They closed the window on me and I could see they were all talking about something, but I didn't know what it was. Eventually the window opened and all I could hear was that they gave the car in front of me my order so they put together a new bag and assured me it was the correct order. Well, they were wrong. I should have checked while I was in line, but I was just so irritated that I trusted them and went home. By the time I got home I checked it in hopes that it was correct and it was not. I paid for a caniac combo and only got the 3 finger combo. The chicken fingers tough and not juicy at all, the fries were all mushy and cold (I only live about 5 minutes away) oh, and they forgot the dipping sauce! So even though I was planning on sharing the meal with my fiance that night I couldn't so instead I made something for dinner for both of us...I guess I shouldn't have gone to raising cane's that day.   I never do the drive thru and so I guess I learned my lesson. Not sure when I will be back, but I'll be sure to give them another shot.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Again, the egg choices looked so elementary and ""un-French"" that there was no point to even trying them.

"STAY AWAY, STAY AWAY!    I've stayed here twice.  I liked the room rate (midweek), but the room window wouldn't close, so the traffic and air conditioner compressors on the casino roof 20 feet away sound like they are in the room with me.  Worse, after getting to bed at 3 this morning (hey, Reno is a 24-hour town), I'm shocked awake before 8 by Housekeeping, banging on the door with her keys.  With the traffic noise and the sound of her banging on the other doors nearby, I couldn't get back to sleep.  To compound it, there is no manager on duty at 8:30 in the morning to complain to, and the guy on the front desk couldn't care less about my complaint.  He even blamed me, for not putting out the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign.  He says that ""all hotels come around at 8.""  I've stayed in hundreds of hotels, since before he was born, and rarely do the other hotels do this.  In fact, THIS hotel didn't do it when I stayed here three weeks ago!

I enjoyed being able to see the chefs counter in the middle of the restaurant, but it would have been cooler if their workspaces were exposed as well, allowing us to see them make the sushi.   The sushi itself was very tasty, and we found that it was decently priced. However, had we ordered more than one roll each, our bill would have been a lot more. We both agreed that this would be a good compliment meal, but it would not be a reasonable full meal. We also ordered the fried vanilla ice cream.

Because my wife has been a patient here for years, and the office is close to our home, I decided to make an appointment here.  The office is in a very convenient location right on Germantown Pike, and it's a good building with a bunch of exam rooms, an area with glasses, and a good sized waiting room, although I don't think it's much in use with the pandemic.

"This place is good as fast food goes but it's still fast food.  I can make better Mexican food at home.  And many authentic Mexican restaurants can make real Mexican food quickly without it being fast food.  What's lacking?  Multiple things:  * The freshness of the ingredients...they're okay, not bad, just not super fresh.  * The salsas are not hot enough.  The medium has almost no detectable heat and the hot is what I'd call somewhere between mild and medium.  * None of the ingredients stand out as amazing.  Everything is just a tad bland: the cheese, the rice.  * The meat is too salty...perhaps to mask low-quality meat?  * The guacamole is insanely expensive..$1.19...I can buy a whole avocado for that price.  Give me a break.  I can understand charging maybe 79 cents but charging well over a dollar is price gouging.  I think it's sad that these restaurants persist when there are so many hole-in-the-wall Mexican places that offer fresher, tastier food for cheaper.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

No bacon in the salad, the vinaigrette had grease particles.  I called Paul the manager who stated that they melt bacon grease to gel the vinaigrette.  And that I could bring my salad back so they could add the two slices of bacon that he couldn't prove that wasn't there. I said really and what is your name again.

"Do you know why macy's stock has dropped 90% since sep 2018 from $41 to $6? Closing 30 stores in 2020, 125 stores in next 3 years. Because this stupid company decided to cut cost by hiring teenagers as store manger, cut staff in departments, so when u buy a mattress from them, they start chasing their tail. not even trying to deliver the mattress to the client. thier furniture department consist of 1/2 of home department, but this kid that macys has hired (for what ever reason) has ONLY ONE GUY working in this department. (commission department). I don't know, may be they are cousins, who knows, what ever it is, I bought a floor model adjustable base set, from him told him I will pick up by wed. / thur.(followed by 3 emails) when I arrived at the store on thur. the mattress was still on the floor ( was not sanitized) was not bagged, and was not removed from the floor.  the store manager refused to come and handle the problem, probably she was on instagram or chatting with girlfriend. whatever she was doing, it was not business because business problem was on furniture department and she was far from even been interested to attend to solve the problem.  after waiting for an hour at the store ( + paying $75 an hour to movers ) they bagged the mattress without sanitizing it, leaned against the dolly  and then the 3 people who were helping, they all disappeared.  I stood there for another 30 min and NOTHING no one came back.  so there i was spending additional $100, NO mattress, (NOT SANITIZED), ignored by a teenager (STORE MANGER) that I was even there and in fact at that time, I was the only person in the mattress department. I went back to the cashier and demanded refund and cancellation. when i asked for my money back 10 min later this girl showed up,  ""lets go to there (pointing to a hallway) and talk i am the store manager.""  i said No. i want my money back, it took you 1 1/2 hours to come down to see what the problem was and all you have to say to me is lets go behind the walls and talk. I was stupid enough not to video this. I am telling it would been a million view in a day. she started to blocking me from going to get my money back. i finally by passed her, she came and kinda run after me passed me and stood 12"" away from me, I think she was upset (boyfriend / cousin/ family member ) (the SOLO) sales person of furniture dep. was upset for writing a a refund.  she treated me like I was to blame for them not having my purchases ready, sanitized and bagged. she made me feel as unpleasant as possible. and i must say, she was successful. (Next day I went to local mattress store bought a mattress and they delivered same day. ) bottom line I am not sure what was it that this store manager and solo sales person of furniture dep did what they did to me, it could of been my accent, my causal clothing, or they wanted that adjustable bed set for them self or a friend, only they know why they were such a rude, arrogant unprofessional teens. What I do know is:  for my business I will never hire a teenager as a store manger and one arrogant sales person for entire 1.5 million dollar department.  of course unless I am dating the guy and I want him to make all the commission. save your money, save your time.

"I went to Hodak's on Saturday for lunch with a few coworkers.  I arrived at 1:00 PM, and there was a short wait.  The server, Mike, was excellent.  He was personable, explained the menu in detail, and was very attentive to all of our requests.  The sweet tea is excellent - and that's from a southern connoisseur of sweet tea.  I ordered the standard meal: fried chicken, crinkle fries, and coleslaw, with an appetizer of fried mushrooms.  The fried mushrooms were huge, and there were lots of them!  The four of us shared them, and we still had a few leftover.  When our food arrived, I tried the coleslaw first... and then I couldn't stop eating it!  I loved every bite of it.  The crinkle fries are pretty bland... I pushed them onto a side plate.  The chicken is perfectly cooked, with a crunchy coating that isn't heavy like Church's or Popeye's.  It is thin, and it is very seasoned.  Which is a complete opposite of the actual chicken, which tastes like it isn't brined or marinated at all.  If it is, maybe it wasn't on the day I was there.  But most southern fried chicken is soaked in buttermilk/hot sauce, or brined in some salt, sugar, and spices.  This chicken wasn't.  It's only flavor comes from the skin/coating.  So if you are not planning on eating the skin (and why are you ordering fried chicken if that's the case???) then you will not have any seasoning whatsoever.  So overall, I would return to Hodak's for the atmosphere, service, drinks, and coleslaw, but I would definitely get something different from the chicken plate.  Hot wings, maybe?",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"The lobster spinach queso is pretty good, and that's about all she wrote.   Inside has a very shiny, backlit bar, chain restaurant feel to it. It's almost too bright and colorful. But good luck reading your menu in a booth behind the giant fireplace or stone column.   I'm tired of waiters everywhere asking if I've dined with them before. If they're not running a unique operation where you order family style only, grilled your own meat, etc., then they do not need to ask me this. I can read a menu as well as someone who *has* dined there before, and I do not need to be baby-walked through the thing. Of course, here at this fairly new restaurant, I was asked if I'd visited before.   I had the sesame encrusted salmon, which is accompanied by parm mashed potatoes and fried spinach. The fish lacked much flavor, the aoli was absent now that I think about it, the potatoes were pre-made not very warm & ho-hum, and the spinach... The spinach was disgusting. It was extraordinarily salty and just terrible. My friend had the sauteed spinach, which also tasted as though it'd been soaked in salt. Forget what his entree was, but I recall a disgruntled face throughout the meal.  I think I had the ginger basil mango mojito, and it was just kind of sad on the tongue. Lackluster like you'd never expect of a beverage containing ginger and basil.   All in all, the pomp does not merit the price.

My husband and I checked in to Sheraton Sand Key on 11/26 to 11/30.  On the 26th i call the front desk due to live bugs in the room.  They sent up a security to wipe down the counter.  No one ever call to check on the bugs issue. The next morning we woke to discover our bed sheets were bunched up under us and our back and neck were hurting. Hotel beds are usually more comfortable than beds at home.   (They use two flat sheets and flat matress cover they dont stay) The matress was  uncomfortably the worst in many years.   We picked Sheraton with out a thought because its always been a no brainer.  The front desk and manager never responded to our expressed concerns.  I had to buy microban 24 and spray for bugs because we were basically ignored.  I think we should be reimbursed for our stay due to both the horrible matress and bugs in the room.  Then to top it all off the noise of both volleyball tournament  that started early am  (7-8) and work being done that started at 6:30 am that vibrated the walls in our room.

"We didn't know what to expect at first given that this cafe occupies a government-owned historical building in Fairmount Park. We were a little worried that it would be a lame concession run by some faceless food service.  What a nice surprise! We walked in to see and smell good food. The employees were friendly, but not in a phony ingratiating manner. The atmosphere is pretty and relaxed, with tall ceilings and seating dispersed throughout a couple different rooms with tall windows and historical artwork.  There was some confusion/delay about seating as it seemed there was no official host or hostess. Considering that there were no mobs of people to fight with in line for a mediocre brunch in CC, this was of little import.  The food was good to better with the eggs being fluffy and cooked to perfection. The omelettes had fresh mushrooms and other fresh vegetables.  The coffee was fantastic.  A nice slow breakfast for the two of us came to $26.

Boy am I glad that I did. At first it was a little overwhelming but once I got my first beer I felt like I was home. I currently live in Chicago so it was great to see all the Eagles fans there. What I liked best was the outside beer garden next to the big stage. I am glad that I got there super early because the closer to game time the line to get in was super long. The only drawbacks were that there wasn't as much seating as I would like although since it was a game day I totally understood. Also I feel like the $5 cover charge wasn't necessary.

"Abington Family Medicine used to be a great place for primary care. Now it's an absolute mess. I only recently started going there/needing things from there on a regular basis due to a diagnosis of DVT. I have to have labs done on a regular basis, and I need instructions on how to adjust my Coumadin dosage based on those labs. That alone has been a battle. I was told when I was at the hospital to call them instead of waiting for them to call me. I was also told to have the labs done early, so I could get same day results. What a joke. I have my labs done by 7:20 AM, and nobody calls me with results. When I try to call late afternoon/night of the same day, I get, ""Oh, yeah, we DO have the results, but they need to be sent to a doctor."" Why were they not sent to a doctor when they first came in? Why does it take me calling the office to have them sent to a doctor? Add to that the fact that for some strange reason, there is only one nurse in the whole place who can actually give me the instructions on how to adjust my Coumadin dosage. I don't know why this is, but I actually had a doctor call me one night after I had labs just to say, ""Yeah, we have your results, but I can't tell you what to do until James updates the system when he's in tomorrow."" Why can't a DOCTOR tell me what I'm supposed to do based on my lab results? Why is there not at least ONE other person there who can do this? I usually still don't get a call the next day and end up having to call by late afternoon, and sometimes even then, I'll get instructions that a doctor has yet to sign off on. It's absolutely ridiculous. I'm doing my part as a patient, and I shouldn't have to chase my results/instructions down like this.  I'm also about to take my last Coumadin pill tonight, and nobody can manage to get me a refill. I've been sending them messages to request a refill on both their online portal and their prescription refill phone line since last week, and I still have nothing. A doctor finally called me back today to confirm everything, including the CVS I wanted the prescription called into. He said it would be in today. Guess what I still don't have?? After he called, I got a call from my mom, who said that the Walgreens by my parents' house has been leaving them messages on their home phone, and it turns out it's for the prescription I requested last week. I don't know how Abington Family Medicine still has that pharmacy or that phone number to use for me, because that hasn't been my information for YEARS now, and I have updated that all in person. I also don't know how the doctor who called me earlier today didn't know or see that the prescription had already been called in to the wrong place. I put in for a transfer to the CVS by me on CVS' website to be picked up by 7:00 PM tonight. I went there, and they can't give me anything from the now 3 listings of Coumadin they have for me until they can get through to Abington Family Medicine. They've been calling AND faxing, and nobody has gotten back to them. I tried to call Abington to complain and demand this be fixed, but tonight is one of the nights they aren't open late, so I guess I know what I'm doing tomorrow morning! Especially since I seriously need a prescription in my hand so I can take a pill tomorrow night. Absolutely disgraceful service. I was trying to just be nice and get through this until January, when I'm hopefully done with this whole process, but I'm so fed up with this place after tonight.",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 1.0

"Of course it's only after I move out of this area that a real, true taco shop opens up here. As far as I know, this is the only real taco shop in the city. Maybe the state! Everything, right down to the design of the menu, is classic taco shop. I'm sitting on Michigan Road in Indianapolis, and I could very well be back in Tucson, at one of the good taco shops there. So I've only been once, but I'm so excited about this place that I have to review it now. They do breakfast burritos and serve them all day (again, something that real taco shops do). Burritos are in a good tortilla and served with the red or green salsa (or both). The salsas are actually the only thing that differ from what I used to get in Arizona. Those were the thin, spicy Sonoran style while these are a little more tomato- and cilantro-flavored. That's really the only difference. The interior is actually cleaner and more pleasant (especially the smell, which was almost always bad at the Tucson places). Prices are about what I'd expect. Tacos run $2-3. Burritos $3-5. They also have the quintessential combo plates. And, yes, you should hope that this place stays in business. This is something so novel to Indy that its survival is really questionable. I'm optimistic. In Tucson, these places seemed to average about three per square mile, so I've always assumed that they were not terribly expensive to operate. I'm hoping that this and the other positive reviews on here will give this place its needed boost. I mean, this is it people; this is how it should be. Just down the street from my current favorite taco place, this may be its replacement. Breakfast burritos are too great to ignore. Open 24 hours. Free wifi.

"We stopped in here for an early dinner.  It fills up fast.  Our service was great.  She quickly had our drinks to the table which we were thankful for since it was such a hot day.  Soon after we had our appetizer of charbroiled oysters. They were huge and served with bread.  The garlic/Parmesan sauce was a bit salty and difficult to eat without a drink.  The day's special was fried green tomatoes for an appetizer. They were a bit under cooked and served on a plate covered in spinach and lettuce.  The soup of the day was oyster and artichoke bisque. It was thin. I didn't taste oysters of any kind, it was more of artichoke type sauce. The husband got the fish daily special.    The service was great. The place was clean with quick turn over..  servers and busses were going non-stop. The food was mediocre.

"Got a Groupon for breakfast..of course did not read the fine print and groupon was not accepted on Sunday..the day we went.  I have bought MANY restaurant groupons and never had a ""black out"" day, which I must say are more upper scale restaurants then this one, but whatever....  Service was slow.  We both got omelettes and I asked to sub grits for potatoes, which the server said I could do with an upcharge of .95 cents.  Last time I checked grits were pennies to make, so not sure why there is an upcharge since grits are probably cheaper then the potatoes they serve.  Prices are high and quality mediocre.  Omelette was very dry and I saw nor tasted any cheese in it (ordered the Western).  Discovered half way into our meal that we did not receive our toast.  Told the server and she did bring it to us, but by then we were practically done with our meal.  Unfortunately, I will have to go back on M-Sat to use my existing groupon..lets just say I am not looking forward to it.  Much better choices for breakfast in the Tampa Bay area (i.e. First Watch).

"Do not stay here unless you absolutely cannot afford anywhere better. Definitely do NOT expect normal hotel hospitality from any of the staff in any way. I can't believe how consistently rude every front desk worker was. The housekeeping came into our room, made only one bed because there was a single jacket on the second bed and they won't make the bed if there is anything on it. They also did not stock toilet paper and did not pull the door shut so it was open while we were out downtown all day.  They also checked someone else into one of the rooms, voiding out our key cards, and giving another hotel guest access to our room.   Do not expect room reservations to be correct...we made reservations for a bachelorette group and asked for rooms next to each other, and when we checked in they weren't even on the same floor-even tho we were told they could be next to one another.  The ""famous indoor guitar shaped pool"" (what a joke) closes at 10:00 -no exceptions. And they WILL send security to escort you out after 10 pm.   No apologies from front desk, they could care less about any of the issues. The hotel itself is a little outdated, the rooms, themselves are decent, and they do have a shuttle available for rides downtown...but thats about the only thing going for this hotel. There was a portion of the ceiling caving in and a bucket to catch the water dripping down in the hallway.. With plaster pieces on the carpet and steps that remained uncleaned the entire weekend we were there... Just not a great experience, but it was fairly inexpensive so we dealt with it.

There was no parking available and had to park block away. However, we were able to do a super early check in as we came into town in a Saturday at 7-8am and given complimentary valet because we were being such a tourist in the area. The bellhop and valet was prompt with assistance and quite cordial (valet located our vehicle and moved it for us, bellhop got our luggage, all while we were checking in). The staff was super friendly (and funny) and recommended us to this amazing local Italian spot. Our room was very clean and spacious. The bathroom was big enough to accomodate the both of us putting on makeup, lol. Complementary WiFi and even came with an iPad for our personal use (a directory app was loaded on it to help us get our tourism on). There was a restaurant and bookstore attached, but I didn't get the chance to check that out. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and it was well worth the price.

In the mornings they will serve berries, smoked salmon with accompanying condiments, cereal and drinks. There is also an afternoon round of light fare and again open bar, followed by another seating after dinner with, you guessed it, more drinks and desserts. There are 5 separate areas where you can sit, including 2 outdoor terraces with great views, and 1 area great for watching TV.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 4.0
"Horrendous service or lack thereof. I met a few friends there Friday night and there was a decent amount of people but the service at the bar was inexcusable. It took me 20 minutes (no exaggeration) to flag the bartender down even though there were two of them who stopped and took drink orders for multiple people around me some of which actually showed up After me. I also watched the two bartenders chatting it up at the left end of the bar for minutes at a time while the bar patrons grumbled about drinks taking too long or food orders not being placed. I myself did not order food, mostly because of how slow and unorganized the bartenders were but also because it seems the menu has shrank quite a bit while the prices have definitely soared. If you're willing to spend $17 for fajitas and wait 20+ minutes to put your drink order in this is definitely the place to go!",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 1.0

"Who knew that Reno has some of the most extensive options for AYCE sushi restaurants? Well, living there for almost a year and being that sushi is, hands-down, my favorite food ever, I tried almost all the AYCE sushi buffets in Reno and Jazmine is the best. Originally, Kokopelli's (in Circus Circus) was tied but the last time I went there (for lunch), I left feeling sorry that I didn't go to Jazmine's instead. Francis's Asian Bistro is also a good place but I haven't gone there for almost 3 years and I've never tried their AYCE, so I can't compare. Nothing else (Sushi Pier, Sushi Pier 2, Sushi Club, Sushi & Teri, Spanish Springs--although it was my pick before I found Jazmine's and because Kokopelli's pricier) comes close.  This is not the BEST sushi I've had (see my review for Sushi Nozawa in Los Angeles for that), but given that it's in Reno, AYCE, and reasonably priced, it deserves a 5 in my book, especially since I consider it the best AYCE sushi I've had. I highly recommend the Jazmine Roll (my favorite--I always order at least 2 for just myself when I come here) and Golden Gate Roll. Mountain Roll is also pretty good, as is the Nevada Roll. I also like the Caterpillar Roll. I haven't tried everything in the 15+ times that I've been there but everything that I've ordered was delicious so I really don't think you can go wrong. I miss this place now that I've moved away but I always hit it up when I visit Tahoe/Reno =)  AYCE sushi is first come, first serve here, so no reservations. Also, I never tried the Chinese food here, so this review is only for the AYCE sushi.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"I mean, this is an okay mall. It gets the job done and I live pretty close to it. It has all the stores I like to shop at like Victoria's Secret, American Eagle (which is pretty small), and Nordstrom. Not to mention it has the one Vera Bradley store in Missouri, so I go there to feed my addiction.  There's not a huge assortment of food places. The movie theater kinda sucks, there's usually only two or three movies showing at a time and its never anything that I really want to see. The security guards are kind of rude when they're carding you. Its not my fault that you don't like your job, don't take it out on me. Three stars because it's nothing special.  The major pro for me is the Vera Bradley store. The major con for me is the lack of food choices.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 3.0

"I don't even know where to begin. I've patronized this establishment four times over the last six months, and every experience is somehow better than the last. Take today for example:  I wake up after a long night of brewery hopping, lightly seasoned with some whiskey from an ionic red-capped, green bottle I keep around the house. In other words I felt, looked and probably smelled like trash. I desperately need a haircut. Picture the reanimated corpse of a 2 week expired Tom Hanks in a version of Castaway that ended a little more realistically than the actual 2000 Hollywood production.   I walk into the shop. Immediately I am bombarded with cheerful greetings from this tatted up, gregarious gaggle of keratinized protein-sculpting motherfuckers.  ""What's up?!"" ""How's your day, man?!"" ""Check in in the back! We'll take care of you.""  I'm directed to the back of the shop where I'm offered a strong, fresh cup of Khaldi's coffee and put on the walk-in list. I head upstairs to wait my turn. My head pounds and I slowly die inside while I read a 1950's print of a book about the proper way to shave with a straight razor. Eventually, my name is called.  I ask for a no-nonsense, no fuss haircut: a high skin fade, no hard part, and clean up what's left on top. This walk-in barber absolutely delivers on that request. The guy even notices how horrible I'm feeling and wraps up the cut with a hot towel over my face to - and these are his words - suck the hangover right out of me.   I walked into this place a wretched, disheveled human being who just wanted to crawl into a cold, dark cave and die. I left an arresting, born-again embodiment of suave. My plans for the day now cancelled; I'm going back to the bar. The people need to see this shit.   11/10. Will go again.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 5.0
"My boyfriend and I ordered a take out pie from Yaquis on a late Sunday night after just arriving to STL on a road trip. Wanted something quick and easy and seeing as how pizza is one of our main food groups, we looked for a local spot that happened to be open late night.  We're not familiar with 'traditional' St. Louis style pizza and how much this deviates from it, but Yaqui's pizza was pretty good - they only have a few options to choose from with one 14 in size, so we got the Margherita and it hit the spot. Slighty charred crust, but not overdone, fresh cheese, good basil flavor, and the sauce was good too.   Obviously slightly cold by the time we took it back to our place, so I imagine it tastes 1000x more amazing as soon as it comes fresh out the oven.",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 4.0

"On a Friday afternoon during lunch, Oyster House was bumpin'. I was drawn in by the fact that it was National New England Clam Chowder Day. In hindsight, I wish I ordered a bowl of the stuff as my lunch, but I ended up getting the Judi salad with a cup of chowder on the side. The soup was lighter than I expected and had a really nice, fresh taste. I loved the smattering of diced fresh chives on top.   Service was on point. It seemed every time I stuffed another oyster cracker into my mouth, someone was there to refill drinks or check on us. I did notice another nearby table that didn't seem to share in this, though. They waited a while to get their food, while our soup came and went and our entrees arrived soon after.   The Judi salad came already-dressed with a nice pile of mixed lettuces, some feta cheese and a generous helping of shrimp salad. I personally found the salad to be a touch too salty, and would probably rectify this next time by ordering the dressing on the side. It was a great salad nonetheless, and certainly filling enough to carry me through the day. I spotted a plate of fried oysters on my way out and resolved to try them next time.   The decor is all white tiles and wood, with oyster plates adorning the walls and other classic touches. The look is simple and spot on for what the place is. High top tables in front are somewhat tight and the stools were a bit uncomfortable, especially after tucking my coat underneath me. Also, the front door allowed gusts of cold air to wash over the room every time it was opened. A temporary winter vestibule would do wonders.  Late night happy hour on Saturday nights from 9-11 seems like a great deal, with dollar oysters, a featured beer and oyster shooters at a nice price.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I wasn't looking for anything special but maybe if somebody checked in or offered to zip up my dress. I didn't even get that!         Instead there were two employees who were fixated on girls that came in after me. I thought "" that's fine"" and continued shopping by myself. I was there a total of about :30 minutes and one didn't even ask if I was finding everything okay. I was completely ignored. Ended up going to Stephens prom and beyond at Castleton.

My girlfriends & I we're in town for the Essence Festival 2015. It was literally around the corner from our hotel. We stayed in the Marriott. I was surprised when we were told that at 2pm they were no longer serving food on a Saturday! This place sits in the middle of a tourist area and we saw them turn away 8 groups of people. Because we walked in right at 155 they did decide to serve us. The food was pretty good. we had the crawfish nachos. They were fantastic! We also had red beans and rice & boudin balls. They were pretty good.  The crawfish etouffee had a little to be desired. Our server was very nice. She was very pleasant despite the gentleman who sat us  like he really did not want to.

"I stayed at Place d'Armes for my honeymoon and have mixed feelings about it. There are things I really liked about this hotel and I'm glad I stayed there, but it didn't live up to my expectations or the pictures they post on their website. This hotel is placed wonderfully close to just about anything you would want to do or see in New Orleans. Jackson Square is half a block a away, there are great restaurants within blocks, and the rowdy Bourbon St is close enough to easily stumble your way back to your room but not so close that the noise will keep you up. It has a quaint charm that boarders on cozy. However, like the rest of the French Quarter, this hotel is old and it shows. Do not expect Vegas style cleanliness or amenities. The springs in the mattress crunched when I laid down, the toilet flushed properly most of the time, you can hear every footstep in the hall on your floor and the one above you, and the decor is just worn out. Everything is a little threadbare, but that really is New Orleans, so it fits the town perfectly. If you have the means make sure you upgrade to a room with a window, and maybe even one of the rooms that has a patio overlooking the courtyard. Bottom Line: I'm not mad that that stayed there and I honestly don't know if accommodations are different at other French Quarter hotel. For what we paid it was OK as a base of operations for our week in a great city.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 3.0

Our waitress Julie was excellent- one of the best waitresses I've had anywhere in a long time! I ordered coffee and the Bam Bam biscuit, which was fried eggs, pepper jack cheese, a fried green tomato and two strips of candied bacon on a huge biscuit. It was delicious - no fuss and good home-style cooking. My friend got the cinnamon swirl pancakes which were also delicious and a huge portion.

None of us had ever had chargrilled oysters before, and I will never forget their beautiful garlicky flavor.  The four of us (all guys with big appetites) split two of the Half Seafood Platters, one fried, one broiled.  It was a good amount of food after the appetizer and I left wanting to grab a dessert, everyone else was satisfied.  I definitely preferred the broiled platter, but they were both good.  The things that really stood out were the crawfish croquettes and the stuffed crab.   Another star of the evening was their boiled potatoes that were cooked in shrimp boil.

"NOT a good experience. I would not recommend this place nor would I ever go back. Ok, so my son wanted a tattoo..we live in Calif...he is 17, so we had to go to Reno where he can get one. I did research on places and thought Aces sounded pretty good. About a week before his appointment, I had spoken with a guy named Amaro (not sure of spelling). I gave him a very detailed description of what my son wanted and where he wanted it. He said they have $80 min/120 per hr. Based on the description he estimated 120-140---probably closer to 120. He asked me to email a pic and he'd call if it were to change (the estimate). Ok, so far all was cool. Yesterday was his appointment...Unfortunately, all went downhill quickly. We were ""greeted"" by a guy, I believe named Drake...then Jake. We are told it will probably be 200 bucks. I explained the conversation with Amaro---they didn't care and showed me on a paper how Amaro had written 200. Anyway, these 2---especially Jake---were filled with attitude, poor customer service and not a modicum of giving a damn about anything. I made it clear that I wasn't paying 200. This went back and forth...all was about as clear as mud as to how this was going to end up. If I hadn't paid 40 buck deposit last week, we would have walked out. I think since they knew we were driving a long distance they figured they can bump up price--esp, as well, because we had paid a deposit. Jake...who is about as unfriendly as they come...completed the tattoo from start to finish in 35 minutes. When it was over, he literally stood, turned and walked away. Did not ask my son if he was happy with it, no after care instructions, no thank you, no goodbye. Stood, turned, walked...Then Drake says ""You owe me 120...total is 160."" What happened to the 120/hr charge...a very simple tattoo that took 35 mins costs 160?? I was in NO mood to argue. My son pulls out a card...Drake says ""ATM there, use that, hand me cash"". Amaro had said when the appt was made that cash is preferred but out of towners can use a card. I guess Drake didn't attend new staff orientation. If I could give 0 I would, the tattoo is good, far from great. What they didn't know was in a few weeks we were gonna be back as he wanted a 2nd one and I wanted a large piece, but I noticed 2 other tattoo spots within walking distance and will research those.

However, the cafe has a tiny little parking lot right out in front, fits 3-4 cars.  It's easy to drive right by the entrance if it's your first time here.

Our chicken nachos had a hard (old) French fry that we found in it. At first we thought it was a bone because it was so hard but it was burnt to a crisp. We told our waitress who didn't even apologize, and just offered to take our food to the back so they could identify what it was. The crab cake sandwich we took home also had a huge shell in it!! Super dangerous to have that in sandwich!  The Wings also could have been cooked a tad more, blood inside of the meat! Unappetizing, and OK food.   Drinks were good, and I did like the cinco de Mayo margarita specials.   Hope they get better as time goes on.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

They have big windows that open and patio area for warmer months. Food is good and consistent. Staff is friendly and efficient even when busy. Portions are good sized, always too much to eat. Reasonably priced. Highly recommend for a casual meal. Only drawback is parking when busy, lot is small but such is the deal for the midtown MNKA",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
This is beer garden/bottle shop/bar combo has been on my radar for quite a while. Finally made it last night on a walk around the city. I was glad to see it was as nice as I expected.   The bottle prices here are a little higher than other comparable locations in the city. The happy hour special on drafts from 5-7 more than makes up for it at 1/2 price. Solid draft selection too; 8 different options rotating. They also do tastings from 6-9 on some nights to it's worth a drop by to try something new. They don't have on-site food preparation but will call for you and have food delivered - I saw and smelled some of the pizza delivered from across the street and it made my mouth water.  Worth the mile and a half walk from home. I'll make the trek again soon for sure.,Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0

"My wife and I visited the Kirkwood location last weekend. I had never been before, my wife had been to the Delmar Blvd. Location.  I guess Pizza has never been a ""big deal"" for me.  I like it now and then so when we decided to have dinner at Pi on Manchester in Kirkwood I wasn't really excited, well, actually I was because we had a gift card and that meant at least we wouldn't have to pay the entire check.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised (by the menu, service, etc., not the crowd that mashed in the small entryway).  We had to wait about a half hour - just as they said we would.  There is a full service bar and you do have the option of sitting there while waiting and if you want to order from there, you can do so.  When finally seated we looked over the menu and decided on the ""location"" special which was the Kirkwood Pizza.  You can order as ""deep dish"" or as ""thin crust.""  We opted for the thin crust.  The pizza featured meatballs, mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, red peppers and, well, I'm not sure I remember what else.  It was great to see MOZZARELLA and not that disgusting PROVEL which sticks to your teeth and, if you're not careful, can choke you to death.  Whoever came up with that gem should be immediately jailed.  OK, the PIzza was GREAT.  We got a 16 inch to share ( you can get 10 inch pies) and we ended up taking some of it home.  I thought it was excellent though I'm no pizza guru.  We also split a Caesar sald which, unfortunately, was served without dressing.  Our waiter quickly fixed that.  I would recommend this location anyway, but if I'm near one of the other ones I will certainly try it out.  I will go back!  Parking is a problem.  The lot is small and not easy to navigate in unless you have a mini cooper or one of those new half passenger vehicles that run on air.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Alright, I will add another star for this place for one server in particular. I do LOVE the two happy hour at this place, 1/2 price beer and pizza = awesomness!  We arrived around 6pm two weeks ago and the place was a little slow.  We only waited about a minute or so before a waitress (Michelle) came out of nowhere and sat us down, we requested outside sitting after she sat us due to the nice weather. There being 5 of us, we were intending on ordering A LOT of beer and many pizzas.  So from my previous experience I was not holding my breath for anything but I was caught off guard for the following reasons:  1) we only waited about 2 minutes before our server returned and took our first order for drinks; 2) waited only 5 minutes before she returned, beers in hand, then took the food order; 3) waited about 15 minutes for the pizzas, and subsequent second round of beers order; 4) waiting even less time for her to return with that!  Now, why this is so impressive to me and why I added the star for the server is that I found out that, she wasn't ever supposed to be serving the outside area!  But not only did she serve us, she waited almost hand and foot!    Needless to say she obtained a sizable tip.  I really hope that the other servers look and start to behave as this one does.  The lot of them could really use some lessons.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"This review is more about the area than the actual room.  First let me clarify one thing about this area.   Within ""Little Harbor"" is a mix of 3 or 4 different groups of buildings.  There is: 1 - Harborside Suites @ LH 2-  The Resort on Bahia Beach @ LH 3-  The Inn @ LH 4-  The Marina 5-  Growing clusters of single family homes Each group has anywhere from idk, 200 to 700 units each. Maybe more!  Some bldgs are only 2 stories while others are 5.  So you get the idea that this place needs its own zip code!  While they talk about the accommodations, they all have the same half mile private beach, the same two workout centers and mostly the same pools.  There are two restaurants for this whole area - a dive bar called Hooks and the Sunset Grill. The sunsets are gorgeous from here but the food is just OK.  Tennis and basketball too.  That's it!   Nothing else to do here if it is not beach weather.  To go into town, it's anywhere between 4-6 miles depending on what you need or want to eat.  This place needs some commercialism!   More restaurants, shops, a place to buy beer or wine, a few snacks maybe, or just some sunscreen,   Heaven forbid you forget something.   The area is just as beautiful as st Pete's, but really low key.  Maybe in a few years they will add a little something something to beef it up.  It could be really great in my opinion.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"After a long drive to and from New York, it was clear that I was not going to drive all the way back to Baltimore in the same night. So I pulled into the first hotel I saw when I drove into Wilmington. Located in downtown, this place is hard to miss. I parked on the street and walked inside to see if they had vacancies. Thankfully, they did, and I checked in. I parked my car in their parking lot, which comprises of four basement levels. I took the elevator up to the lobby, then another up to my room. And which room number did I get? 420. First I get room 666 in DC, and now I get room number 420 here in Wilmington. I don't know why I get such interesting numbers... is it a sign? Anyway, the room I got was amazing and spacious. It was also very clean, and had a nice view of the downtown area. I was beat, and the bed was super comfortable, so I fell asleep fast. I woke up to find that is was too late to get breakfast at the restaurant found in the lobby (ends at 11:00AM). No worries, as I found a food spot not far from here. The staff was super friendly, and they enhanced the great experience I had here. Where hotels in Philadelphia failed to get me accomodations, this hotel in Delaware took care of me well.

"the crust is weirdly like matzo. Im not sure why this is, maybe its because they use matzo or because the dough has way too little yeast, there's very little give, its just cracker like and shatters too easily. The toppings were pretty good and the sauce and cheese were solid. I'm always a little put off by the Midwestern (is it really Midwestern?) slicing of circular pies into uneven squares but fine, when in rome.

Pictures of family members everywhere, the décor was all home and handmade, etc. We came to use a Groupon I purchased (which i'll talk more about later in the review). There was me, our 2 kids and my fiancé. One of the owners (I think that's who he was) came over to the table almost as soon as we were seated to chat a little and had ""surprises"" for my babies. I have expressed before how much I love when people interact with my girls and not treat them like they're not there or unwelcomed. Anyway, he brought them some light up bracelets that they LOVED (what kid doesn't love stuff that lights up!).   Anywho... on the VERY FRONT OF THE DOOR, there's a small sign, with huge print, regarding the usage of the groupon at the restaurant.

Unless it's an alcoholic drink, my fiancé and I only drink water. So we ordered the lesser of the drink evils, lemonades. We ordered an all meat pizza, wings, my boo got an order frog legs & a gyro.   that GYRO WAS THE BOMB. Full of flavor and delicious. The pizza was... good, just wasn't cooked all the way in the center for my taste.... the wings were also good. Buffalo sauce wasn't super spicy and super saucy like I like along with the breaded crunch I adore!!!   our server was nice & attentive. However... After we gave her our groupon, she STOOD at the table and ASKED US how we were taking care of the rest of the bill. I was so annoyed by that. like, do you think we are not going to pay or something???? the owner told us she was new, but ummmm... no.  overall it was just a basic bar and grill joint.

On the upside, the pickle was legit.  As for the bar, I must have missed the hipster train, because I have no use for 20 different beers that all seem to have fruit or nuts or quadruple hops in them. And let's be honest, if your top shelf whisky is Jack Daniels, you've failed.  If Can's was attempting to be a lame, overpriced, hipsterdrome that will be forgotten in two years, they've succeeded...

"Just got off the ""Paradise"" 6 days 5 nights to Cozumel and Grand Cayman. Perfect weather! Crew very hospitable. Jamie, cruise director had great sense of humor. Ship a little dated. (19 years old)  Lots of red hues. Rooms comfortable but needed a shampoo on our,  what else, red rug and a thorough dust/wipe down on top of TV, on top of clothes closet etc. We breath that air for 5 days. No windows in room. Not too much to ask.    Food extremely disappointing. Breakfast good though. Boiled eggs were boiled. Bacon cooked. Not many choices for dinner (one assigned dining room) and a lot of recycling of menu items. When I see a short rib or a lamb shank on the menu,  I am expecting meat attached to a bone. Shrimp cocktail is micro size. Drink/ Alcohol plans are great if you are a lush and want to pay flat rate $60 per day, (including port days). Otherwise you pay as you go, ie  $12 for pre-made LI ice teas w tax/and 15% tip.  Entertainment was pedestrian at best, ie a ""rock show"" with no rock band. Nothing even close to off off broadway. The ""theature"" where you sit had virtually no seat backs, very uncomfortable....an invitation to leave.  Don't get internet package because $88 gets you a frustratingly bad wifi connection.  Why do you get  wifi included on Jet Blue at 35,000 feet and bad wifi from Carnival Cruise for $88 at sea level? Just asking.

Our server was super friendly and we made friends with the table next to us because the balcony was probably like 4 feet wide and the tables were pretty close together.  This was a great way to start our time in New Orleans and I'm glad we stumbled across this restaurant!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
Nothing like a nice relaxing day at the beach with ice cold drink in your hand. This laid back tiki bar makes some awesome drinks with a little punch to them.  Me and my buddy hadn't eaten all day so I got a Caesar salad too which wasn't too bad.   It's funny because this kid tried to buy a drink with an expired license and the bartender laid into him. I think she thought it was fake and wouldn't serve him. He got mad and stormed away but apparently cops do sting operations at this place all the time.   Overall this is a nice place and a chill place to wind down when you're at Clearwater Beach,Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0

"Came here after hearing raves about it from friends, but I actually wasn't all that impressed. The food was decent. Both times I've gone, I ordered some kind of omelet that were okay, but nothing special. But I do have to say that their homemade cornbread is one of the best I've ever had.

"I write only as to the pizza - it's really fantasic.  It's of the same variety as Paolo's and Gianfranco's:  crisp, flavorful crust with minimal high quality toppings.  I think La Fuente's it is lighter and less greasy than Gianfranco's and Paolo's, and the toppings available are more to my taste - spicy cotto cappicola, fresh tomato, bacon, pancetta, artichoke hearts, arugula, Italian hot peppers, spinach,  fresh basil, etc..  There is a caveat - the toppings are expensive so if you start designing your own pie, the cost is going to add up quickly.  Their special pies look delicious and are reasonable, however.  This is a great addition to South Street - very family friendly and comfortable, with great people watching in the booths by the windows.  Like the others, I can't understand why this place isn't packed.  While we were eating, however, the delivery guy came and went several times so I figure they must be doing bang-up business in delivery.  If you find yourself on South Street in need of good food, give this place a try.    If you remember Joey's Stone Oven Pizzeria in the same space, the pizza recipe is the same.  There are new owners, however, and the menu has expanded to include burgers and other sandwiches, as well as pasta and salads.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Visiting my brother in Nashville for the weekend, we hit up 12th and Porter on Saturday night for a Next BIG Nashville double-bill featuring Mikky Ekko and AutoVaughn and had an amazing, high-energy experience at this intimate venue that still feels like a good secret.  Pros -Dual layout features a DJ-driven dance floor with a more traditional club feel in one room, then through a low-key door lies a dark rock room with a big stage and high PV lights and audio. -Amazing live music. Hard to say if it was just the night, but the bands were great. -Vibes baby. Felt like getting in on the next big thing.

"Where do I begin? We just came home from my son's wedding in Philadelphia. Our friends and family stayed at the Sheraton Downtown. At first, everything went well, people were accommodating and the gentleman I worked with seemed great.  We started this process in July. That was 3 months ago. I needed early check in for 5 rooms (rehearsal dinner), a block of rooms for guests and we wanted to treat our guests to breakfast after the wedding on Sunday morning. This doesn't seem complicated, but apparently, it was.  The front desk could only put 2 family members in rooms the rest had to wait. I had to remind them to please give out the gift bags to guests and did they have the vouchers for breakfast to give the guests? They had the gift bags and were very nice about it, but knew nothing about the vouchers.  Very long story short; today was a fiasco. I was paying for 30 buffet  breakfasts, I was TRYING to pay. I was charged $23 each and told the breakfast was $17.95 per person, but there was tax and a 22% GRATUITY automatically put on. I have never paid 22% for a buffet gratuity. The service was very good and the food was very good too. The waitress started saying that they weren't going to get their tip if I put it on my card, I sat and listened saying that I did understand what she said, never raised my voice, was not in any way rude. Her manager came over and told her to leave so she could speak to me. The manager straightened it out (I paid at the front desk) but I have never experienced anything so disorganized in my life. Not a good experience, I (and I will recommend  to my friends) to stay there if they want, but NOT have an event, they don't know what they're doing...",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 2.0

"I've had pho all around Philly, and this place cannot be beat.  Not far from my work, I eat here at least twice per week.  This is one of the places where your mouth waters just thinking about it. The pho stock is always light and flavorful, without a doubt prepared from scratch. The noodles al-dente, slowly cooked by the broth as it sits.  The chicken - REAL pieces of pulled chicken!! Not the mystery meat you can expect at other places.  You also get loads of scallions and always a fresh plate of sprouts, chilies, and thai basil to add.  Pho & beyond's facade is a little off-putting from the outside, but inside it's cozy, BYO, and the service very prompt.

"Used to frequent this place all the time when I was a student for sandwiches and the occasional pizza so it's been years since I've been back. Husband has never been so I thought I'd take him. New remodel is nice, much more open and ""restaurant feeling"" with lots more seating. We ordered a couple of beers, a Greek salad and a Phig pizza. Salad was decent and pizza was okay.  Good crust, decent toppings but just not any real flavor. Little disappointed since I remember it being so much better. Could not get a refill on my tea since there was only one cashier/BT and the water dispenser jug was empty. I would have given my review 3 stars but here's where I knock another star out...dogs!!  Now don't get me wrong, I'm all for doggies. Have no problem with them. Had one, loved it till she got old and passed BUT I NEVER TOOK HER INTO AN EATING ESTABLISHMENT!!! I have noticed an increase in this practice and it's DISGUSTING. And against health code. Why didn't the employees say something?? The dog did not have proper gear if it was supposed to be an assistive dog nor did any employee ask them for proper paperwork. I also don't like when said dog happily walked over and parked itself on my foot while I was eating. I also considered purchasing some of the awesome looking mangoes till I noticed the dog owner walking over and handling the produce.

They also don't give a military discount where most companies in the treasure valley do. However, besides the mediocre food, the other deal breaker is we were there to celebrate and put that on our reservations but weren't offered any type of dessert, let alone a dessert menu.

"2.5 stars.  Came here to celebrate a couple of birthdays recently and found it to be a touch lackluster.  We were sitting in a corner of the upstairs Treehouse area right under a speaker...so it was entirely too loud with too much bass for us to be able to hear each other, let alone hear our waiter.  It was also sticky-muggy-hot in our corner, which made the whole experience a bit uncomfortable.  We tried the bleu cheese chips, the tenderloin sliders with macaroni, and the smokehouse platter with sweet potato casserole, and everything I found to be oversalted and overpriced.  We ended up spending more here than we did at Saffire the other night, ordered comparable food, and the quality was no where near as high.  Our waiter was friendly and did his best to communicate with us over the noise.

In hindsight it was my mistake, I should have checked what was in the bag, but I didn't so when we sat down to dinner everything ordered was missing something or wrong: the Sweet and Sour chicken did not include the sauce, we got fried rice instead of brown rice, we received 3 spare ribs instead of 6, 1 egg roll instead of 2 and the wrong soup.

"Rare occurrence of a Malaysian Kopitiam in Philly! Had the chicken satay, beef rendang and vegetable achar. Rice cakes (ketupat) not available that night.  The ice lime tea was ok (a bit weak on the lime juice) but overall it was an enjoyable evening with pretty tasty food. The beef was well cooked, tasted similar to readings I've had in KL, Bali and was not spicy at all (tasted more sweet than anything). Achar was lightly pickled and consisted of carrots and cucumbers (covered in a peanut sauce??) - could do with a bit more variety in vegetables (cabbage, cauliflower, green beans? etc).  The dining room got very busy and loud as the night progressed and most of its tables could seat two to four people (could have handle larger groups at a pinch) but the dining room didn't look that large overall.  It is a BYOB restaurant (being a Halal friendly restaurant) so no pork or alcohol on the menu.  Overall, pretty good rendition of Malaysian hawker food, pricing is about right given we're in East Pussyunk and let's face it, good South East Asian food in the USA is not that easy to find (amongst Cantonese and western/pan-Asian food options out there).

"Hugo's Deli   On 2/11/21, I bought $32+ of food at Hugo's Deli in Boise, which included pretty much everything except a sandwich. Overall, I was disappointed.   The two items I did like were the fried chicken breast ($3.59) and the fries ($1.82). The fries come with the option of their homemade fry sauce and ""spicy ketchup."" I tried both. I like the fry sauce, which has barbecue sauce added to it. I was surprised to find that the ""spicy ketchup"" is nothing more than cocktail sauce. I was not so impressed with either item that I see myself returning for them.  The kielbasa sausage ($1.44) looked good but had little flavor and was overwhelmingly ""fatty."" I took one bite and was done with it.   I was told none of the sides/salads, with the exception of the coleslaw ($1.93) are made there. They are from Sysco I'm pretty sure the slaw dressing isn't made there either. Although the cabbage in the coleslaw seemed relatively fresh, it was overly dressed. The potato salad ($2.30) was okay. I didn't like the macaroni salad ($2.07) at all. The only item I  cared for was the baked beans ($3.71).   I was told they make their macaroni and cheese ($2.64) in the house. It was not exceptional in anyway. It tasted better than next day after I added salt to it.  I had assumed the soups were made in house. I wish I would've asked before ordering them because I could tell simply from looking at them that they were not. I got a small Split Pea and Tomato Basil with Pasta ($2.95 each). Neither one was good.   The desserts are made by a former employee. I bought the Carrot Cake ($3.39) and an Eclair ($1.99). I didn't like either one. The carrot cake was overly sweet. The eclair looks good, but the puff pastry seems stale and the filling was ""meh.""  ImHugo's Deli is a business I wanted to try for years. Although I did not order a sandwich, based on the large variety of food that I did try, as well as the quality of their deli meat, and how overpriced the food is, the majority of which is not even made in-house, I'm not inclined to give it a second chance.   I did appreciate that Hugo's Deli is following the mask mandate.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"We only spent two nights here but had a relaxing and enjoyable time.  If you don't like kids or pets, this may not be the place for you.  We had no issues with either.  Our first floor room and furnishings were showing some age, but it was clean and comfortable.  The grounds are well maintained and proximity to the beach is a major plus.  The food was good and portions sufficient.  Most pleasant takeaway for us was the friendliness and warmth of the entire staff.

"Nice wine selection. Flights and beer are pricy. Each glass averages $13, but you didn't come here because it was cheap. Most likely its the ambiance that attracted you into Unplugged, and rightfully so. Hole in the wall charm, with a seating layout that maximizes the space. Two-tops along both walls with long communal tables in the middle, backed up by a bar framed with a floor-to-ceiling wall display of wine bottles. The place has a rustic charm, the kind you get visiting a vineyard tasting room or wine cellar. A sweet wall covered in a huge chalkboard, spotlighting the special beers, lines the east wall. Light fare such as cheese and nuts is available, and they also have pizza. The sommelier service is tops and the space is quiet enough to hold conversation.   Great place to start off or finish the night, but the seats aren't comfortable enough to hang for very long. Flights are definitely the best seller here. Needs some tweaks, like different cheese and meats plate varieties, and maybe take advantage of the huge chalkboard and throw the wines on it a-la Tap&Bottle.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I just can't bring myself to give Jane 5 stars.  1st) their wine glasses. Sorry, but serving good wine in crap glasses is something for mediocre Italian restaurants to pull.   your wine should be served with just as much care as your food. sending out wine in a joker glass is just that, a JOKE. buy some real wine glasses, or don't sell wine worth drinking.  2nd) the food was solid. the food didn't blow my mind by any means, but it didn't disappoint in any way either.  Fix the wine glass problem, and I'd probably go back. Don't fix the wine glass problem, and I'd rather hit up an equal or better restaurant where they use glassware that actually helps bring out the full flavors of their wines.  I was led to believe that Jane was a bit more fine-dining that what we experience. Not that it's a bad thing to not be ""fine-dining"" - but I think our expectations were a bit high going in.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I enjoy the flavor the crust and light sauce and toppings. I am a Meatsa pizza kind of guy. They have a new recipe for the crust and it is very tasty - spongy, a bit yeasty with the hand tossed version.  I found it reheats on the stove top in a skillet with lid over low heat with a cover - put a little olive oil in the bottom. Heat bottom and top. Low Heat.  I do not care for their artisan pizzas.

"Another review that isn't necessarily about the place as a whole, but rather the pinball machines contained within.  The Pink Galleon is a wide open space, meaning that even with a crowd, the noise is never more than a dull buzz.  There are pool tables and ping pong tables, all in decent shape, and the service at the bar is quick with a heavy pour.  Not a bad environment for some pinball.  They have a couple of newer Sterns there.  When I visited, they had AC/DC and Metallica, both in very nice condition, playing fast and level.  The sound was up loud enough to hear over the din, and everything on both machines was in perfect working order.  Many thanks to the operators for keeping the games in good condition.  The only thing that keeps me from giving a five-star rating is that there's only 2 machines, when there is certainly space for more.  Granted, most people aren't there for pinball, but it's always great to see games on location!",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0

When I received my statement my total refund was $11.76! They charged a ""return fee"" of $7.50 over and above the return shipping fee.

"I've been here twice for lunches with my office mates, and had a great time both times! I wouldn't say there's anything really wrong with this place, it's more that there's nothing especially amazing either. And to me that screams 3/5 stars.  If you don't know, Acropolis is an (Americanized) Greek chain. The restaurant design is fairly standard: A large, brightly lit room with huge windows filled with plenty of tables and booths along the edge. Nothing really noticeable or memorable about the design, it's very safe and comfortable for a chain.  The service there has always been good but, again, nothing special. It's exactly what I would expect from a restaurant like this: the servers are always pleasant and the food usually comes out fairly quickly, although it's not always perfect.  The food is pretty tasty, I will admit, but definitely more of the American version of 'Greek,' than a traditional Greek restaurant. The best thing about the food is that there's so dang much of it. A normal lunch plate is filled with so much food it's a wonder that half of it doesn't topple to the floor. Every entree comes with a full Greek Salad taking up about good amount of the plate. The entrees themselves aren't exactly wimpy in size, leading to a very full plate (and stomach, if you eat it all). Add to that the usual side of fries (or specialty Greek fries, which as far as I can tell are just normal fries with some Feta cheese sprinkled on top after they've already been sitting there a while), and you've got a delicious, filling, average American 'Greek' meal.  The price is pretty fair, though honestly I would probably prefer to pay less in exchange for a smaller plate. My stomach and wallet would thank you.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

The interior has a super cool, modern yet rustic feel (you'll know what I mean) and I feel is well-suited for just about any occasion.  The Parmesan/oil/garlic/red pepper dip they serve with the bread is seriously addicting. I try not to buy bread, but I will be this weekend, when I attempt to recreate that heavenly dip.  My entree was the seafood Alfredo which was also amazing, bar the shrimp which was pretty overcooked and under seasoned.

"The food is good but the service is terrible.  First, I asked for a straw for my water and was given two drink stirring straws that are much shorter than my glass so they were useless as they sank.  Turns out, people bring their own straws to this place because of this issue.  Second, bartenders spent more time on their phones, talking to each other, showing sketch book drawings and complaining about a sick co-worker than actually proving any service.  Waited over 10 minutes to get a beer (only 4 of us at the bar), then when they brought my appitizer, none of the three people there thought to give me a napkin and utensil to eat it with and then it took 15 minutes to cash out.   Third, apparently everything was an inconvinced to kid that was bartending because he would roll his eyes and sigh if the phone rang (which it did all of 3 times the whole time I was there, so it was not a constant thing), acted annoyed at making at getting every single drink order and would disappear from the bar completely at times while I was still waiting to get a beer.

Who still serves rice pilaf except senior citizen cafeterias?A po' boy had to be returned to the kitchen because it had the wrong type of filling.

Just trying to get in and out of the airport driveway is an exercise in futility.  The last few times I've flown out of this airport the security checkpoints just seem beyond unprepared for the volume of people that come through. My most recent time, it was backed up and just not moving.  For some reason they have one security post dedicated for just one group of travelers.  That may not seem too crazy but most of the airports I've been in have them multitasking.  Especially if they're not particularly busy.  Instead, they had one brave soul directing traffic so the mouth breathers wouldn't just stand there mouth agape waiting for the next like minded person to move about.  There also didn't seem to be enough bathrooms/bathroom space, at least in the B concourse.  The first mens room I saw that I went to was literally 3 stalls.  WTF.

"I don't know, I am neither a glass half full nor a glass half empty kind of guy.  No, my philosophy is the glass is totally full, and it's not that way because someone filled it for me, it's that way because I've learned how to keep it full.  This being said, I just wish that certain members of the younger generation, high school and college aged individuals understood that the only way to even have a glass at the table, regardless of the condition of the contents, is to embrace the overwhelming need to have a true sense of urgency in attaining short term goals.  Politeness will only get you so far.  So in other words, hustle it up.  Outback is just about always a 4 star, sometimes a five, in my book.   The food is always consistent providing an experience that is as predictable as the fact that the sun will most certainly rises in the east every morning.  This location, with my server is a 3.5, however just about every other staff member is a five, for service, which brings the total up just above a four.   We had to ask a bus boy for our first drink after no less than 10 minutes.  (I time such things.  It should be no more than about two minutes, especially on a slow Monday night.) Normally I would be going bonkers, but I was taking my mother out and she is disabled and often drinks rather quickly at restaurants for some reason.  Better to slow her down than to have a difficult time getting her situated in the car.  So the delay was good, but it was not intentional, it was just a slow and inattentive on the part of the server.    The waitress was overly pleasant when she came by, which was at the edge of annoying, the very edge.  So drinks were very slow, food was very slow, and I noticed the manager running around getting surveys from surrounding customers.  My facial expressions may have kept her away, but I really try not to project my emotions, especially of annoyance, on my face when people are touching my food.   It is what it is.  Most every other server was hustling.  Our server seemed like she was better suited for the career choice of skipping through a field counting the butterflies and singing with the blue birds.  Being nice and pleasant is good; however being efficient and conscious of your guests is often times more important.  Outback could have had another drink out of each of us and maybe desert, which might have added another 20 bucks to the check.  This in turn would have added another 2 dollars to the waitress's tip.  Servers are, for all intents and purposes, commissioned sales people.  It is a nickel and dime business, and no nickels or dimes can be left on the table.  Maybe this server would be best utilized as a hostess.  For all I know she was a hostess the day before.  At any rate, the GM of this location should ensure that the server training is universally administered and a time table as to an acceptable wait time for customer interaction should be reviewed. Again, if not for the hustle of everyone else in the restaurant, this review would be regrettably much lower.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"After a nice, relaxing day at the beach, me, my girlfriend (Megan), my best friend (Chris), and his girlfriend (Michelle), were looking for a place to eat some dinner. A quick search on Yelp found us Sandbar.  It's stereotypical of a joint off of the beach: small and definitely local. The people that were there all seemed to know each other. I would have loved a view of the beach, but due to where we were seated (inside, vs. the patio), we didn't really get that. Oh well.  We were a bit surprised to hear that the bar was out of simple syrup, which kept Michelle from ordering a mojito. Point off for that, as simple syrup is a key bar ingredient, and it's something that's very easily made up in the kitchen. That said, our server was highly attentive and friendly, which helps make up for that.  Food-wise, we each ordered something different. Chris had a Tampa-Style Cuban, Michelle had a Pulled Pork Sandwich, Megan had a Low Tide Burger, and I had a Buffalo Surfside Chicken. We all had fries with our meals. The only slip-up was that Megan got a rather measly portion of fries, though this was quickly remedied by our server, who brought out an extra side of fries free of charge.  Portions were huge, and the perfect solution to out hunger. Too bad I don't live out there, Sandbar would be a favorite place of mine.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0

"We've been going here every Saturday for about 2 years. Last Saturday was the last, unless there are some changes. They have a new supplier for their chips. The new chips are thick and chewy, like cardboard, instead of light and crispy. We complained, but management is set on this new chip. We are now frequenting other Mexican restaurants. Sorry, but I don't drink while munching on cardboard.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Came in for lunch and on their menu they have around 15 or so lunch specials from $5.99 to $6.99. Nice. Their staff is so cheerfully friendly. The chips are great, I enjoyed the salsas, one mild and one hot. And I enjoyed the freshly made guac for $2.00 well spent. 4 stars.  My wife had the fish tacos, probably made of Tilapia. We're not huge fans of Tilapia as it is a tad fishy tasting. The tacos weren't bad, just not great, because of the Tilapia. It was small flanks of fish on a small street taco tortilla. She had a grilled and two breaded ones to try. 3 stars.  I had the tacos (?) can't remember the name, but the shells were crispy pan fried. It comes with three so I tried all options: a shredded beef, a hamburger, and a chicken. All were OK. Not great, OK. I actually didn't enjoy the shredded beef that much because since it was twice cooked, it was a bit fibrous and chewy. I just don't like shredded beef, I guess. Your mileage will vary. The hamburger one was OK and so was the chicken. It comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, and pico, but there is no way you can put it in the taco without breaking the shell into smithereens. So that was kind of a fail. I took a bite and forked some of the lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, pico into my mouth. I also tried putting it on top of the taco shell sideways and eating it, but that wasn't successful, either. 3 stars.  The specials came with beans and rice. The rice was average. The beans were mixed with red enchilada sauce. I didn't like the resulting flavor. I just wanted some good, lard-laden refried frijoles. Didn't get it. 2 stars.  Got some good ratings here on Yelp. Maybe I'll go back one day and try something else. Otherwise, my 3 star rating is about right for me.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Came here Sunday for brunch. I got a burger and fries with a side of grits. My friend got french toast. Our food took probably 30mins to come out? They had drag brunch going on upstairs and said the kitchen was behind. But there was a sign that said they have it the last Sunday every month, so I can't see why they haven't figured out what to do about the kitchen being backed up. My burger and fries was really good. I got a side of aioli for the fries and loved it. My grits were good, but cold. Our food took so long I didn't want to say anything about it to our waiter. My friend said her food was okay - her French toast was sort of burnt and she sent her bacon back 3 times because it was burnt, then under cooked. Maybe we picked a bad day to come?

We park at the zoo $13 in advance and then get shuttled to the prison.  We waited in line after line but it moved so you were ""walking"" the entire time.  They added a cool 3D piece since the last time I was there.  You definitely have to go with a group to enjoy yourself.  We wanted the group pic but it was $25 for one pic (gulp).

"Sure, Rocco's isn't really a bar where you'd want to take your friends who are visiting New Orleans, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's not worth your time. It's a good enough establishment for what it is: a college bar. Within walking distance of both Loyola and Tulane, this bar is a prime location for meeting up with friends... if it's still early. Before 10:30PM it's relatively quiet and manageable. Once 11 comes around, the college kids start pushing in and the dance music is pumped up. If you like that sort of scene, by all means, Rocco's is a great place for you to get a moderately priced drink and get your groove on. If this isn't necessarily what you're looking for, it's still a fun place to be. Arriving before the college crowd enables one to get a good spot either at the bar for easy access to the alcohol or in a booth to have a rousing conversation among friends.  Drink specials include deals like $5 for 3 Miller High Lifes on Thursday, $3 Big Ass Draft on Saturday, $5 Patron shots, and $5 Long Islands and Hurricanes.

I was camping nearby at Carpinteria State Beach, so Siam Elephant was literally only 2 streets off of my campsite. Truly more than convenient. My party and I had a dog with us, and of course our dining choices varied by who was accepting of animals. Siam Elephant said they gladly accepted dogs on the patio with a leash and whom are well behaved.   When we got there to check into our reservation, they were so incredibly kind enough to pull out a fold-able table and chairs, to create a table specifically for my party and I with our dog. It was something that wasn't necessary by any means and it was TRULY appreciated. We joked about it being a ""VIP"" table. LOL.  The food was fantastic, along with the Thai iced tea (the best). Food was prepared in decent time, and the presentation was absolute mouth watering. Prices are on the higher side of things, but it's expected in a touristy area.

I had the seafood salad for an entree.  The shrimp and crab were fresh in a light tasting lemon vinaigrette over chickory with some avocado.  Hubby had the NY strip which was tender and done to perfection.  We each had a slice of Strawberry Rhubarb Cheesecake.  It was somehow light, decadent and creamy all at once.

When I would go to the location and explain to them that I was charged on my card, they would say that they didn't have any mobile orders and that I would have to just order and pay again.

"Why 5 stars? Because it's completely worthy of the 5-star average.     ---   ---   ---  This is my newest discovery, and it's about as shocking as they come.  This little taco shop in Land O' Lakes is so unassuming that it doesn't even have a sign on the building. In the days before Yelp, I don't think I would know about it even if I lived across the street, but wow are these people good at taco-making!

My goal is to try them all, but it's tough to decipher which is which, because I'm in too much of a hurry to eat them, to seriously analyze and judge them.   If I were a true professional, I'd take a bite or two of one taco, jot down some notes, and thoroughly ponder my evaluation.   And while I do consider myself a professional eater, Capital Tacos turns me into a total fan boy that can't control his emotions.

"Originally, we were supposed to go to another sushi restaurant. Unfortunately, it was closed. We decided to go towards City Centre to find another location to eat at.

I think he could have been the owner. He was really nice.  For the food. It was decent. The portions were okay. I wasn't completely full but wasn't very hungry after. The sushi was kind of plain/somewhat dry and some of rolls were kind of bland. For the price, it wasn't really worth it. The nigiri and the rolls contained a lot of rice, a little fish.

"So I gave fednuts another try, this time for their chicken. I ordered the whole chicken with buttermilk ranch dry rub and a wet glaze of the chili garlic and an iced coffee. We thoroughly enjoyed both kinds, though the dry rub definitely stands up better to reheating then the glaze. the chicken was super crispy, fresh tasting and hot even by the time i got home with it.  I was sad they didn't have any more wings by the time I went in (mind you I was there at 12:30!) so I guess they're a hot ticket item and we'll have to come back to try those out next time.  They served some kind of pickled condiment along with the chicken and I was not impressed. They tasted old and were soft instead of crunchy.  I like pickled veggies, especially with something heavy like fried chicken so I applaud the thought but their execution at least of the ones i got just missed. The iced coffee I ordered was delicious and made with those cool japanese style cold brew thingys. And lastly, we got some hot donuts alongside the chicken, and I cannot say they won me over or changed my mind since my last review.

"I am a huge fan of having late dinners, especially on the weekend.  The work week doesn't afford the same kind of culinary freedom the weekend does (at least for those of us who works days) and the weekends provide a great time to sleep late and eat late.  And here is why I LOVE Suzy Wongs.  They are open til 4am.  4AM.  And its right next to PLAY, a fantastic night club with weekend drag shows.  There is no place to people watch like Suzy's at 2am.  And just because its late does not mean the food isn't fantastic.  The yum bowls are out of this world.  I am a fried rice kind of girl (because I can never trust a place that can't get fried rice right) and this yum bowl is just that...YUM.  My BF is a huge fan of the garlic noodles, which have the perfect amount of garlic and don't leave you with vampire-killing breath afterwards.  The Asian wonton nachos are so fun to eat and like nothing you've ever had.  The fusion of flavors is just perfect.

I usually buy fake eyelashes, wigs, and related items when I visit Gibbol's. The woman who works there is super nice and always willing to help me find a specific wig style or color. The wigs they sell are high quality kanekalon fiber which is very easy to work with and looks more realistic than the cheapie wigs you find during Halloween and at other stores.  They occasionally have magicians come to perform, especially on Saturday afternoons so definitely come to watch that! The tricks are really amazing and not just ""kid stuff.""

I chose this place because they had availability.   The venue is spotlessly clean and my waxer was nice.  However, when I got home and inspected the work, there were large patches of hair remaining, as well as spots of purple wax.  It took me hours with my tweezers to even partially ""fix"" the oversights, and that purple wax did not come off easily even with scrubbing and scratching.  Thank goodness I hadn't been planning to go anywhere in a dress for the next couple days.  The manager, to her credit, has offered me a $50 voucher for future work.  But honestly, I don't think I need to be taught this lesson a third time.    Moral of the story: if you go here, check the work while you're still there, particularly if your body hair is light.  It may feel rude, but don't be shy; you are totally entitled to do this.  In necessary, ask her to go back in for round two, and to clean up the blobs of wax sticking to your legs.  It's a shame that this is a BYOQC place, but hey, it will spare you my disappointment.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 2.0

"Compared to other Embassy Suites, this location is subpar. The Tampa, FL Embassy Suites' kitchenette was twice as long, and the continental breakfast lasted until 10AM there instead of 9AM here. The front desk staff is pleasant though. Even though they probably only saw me once for check-in, the guy knew my name the next morning.  You do need to stay on top of the front desk and housekeeping staff though. I called asking for extra shampoo/conditioner and pillows about an hour before we left, which never arrived. The items never arrived while we were gone for nearly 12 hours either. I was just too tired to call again when we returned.  Thanks to the American Outlaws discount (supporters group for the USA Soccer Men's National Team), the room was $124/night. I was told over the phone the shuttle will drive you within a 2-mile radius, including LP Field. Upon arrival, we discovered the shuttle doesn't go across the river. So, even though LP Field is within a 2-mile radius, you can't take the hotel shuttle to LP Field.  Also, beware valet parking is $19/night. I don't know what self-parking costs, but I am not sure if this was in the confirmation email. So, when I forwarded my roommates the email, they didn't know about the fee.  Wifi is free in the lobby, but not free in the rooms. There are different kinds of wifi to sign up for; I just chose the $5.95 rate. Be aware the wifi is exactly 24 hours, not linked to the time you check into your room. Thus, if you decide to check in early at 10:30AM, but you're not checking out until 11:30AM the next day, there's an hour when you will not have wifi (unless you pay for another 24 hours).  We only stayed one night, but I don't know if I'd enjoy this hotel if staying long term. It is quite a walk to downtown Nashville. We ended up taking a cab Tuesday night back to the hotel when it started raining. From Layla's Bluegrass Inn (see my last review), it cost $7.50 for cab fare, which wasn't too bad.    Oh, the most annoying thing of all was housekeeping coming to the door twice on the morning of checkout. It's like they wanted to kick us out 2 hours before noon. Sheesh!",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 3.0
"I was really looking forward to eating here after all the good things I'd heard. I really wanted to love this place. The pictures on Yelp, etc, made it seem a lot different than it really is. I kept seeing that river rock fireplace so I imagined a cozy lodge theme. Silly me. When you have a bar with a sasquatch theme, the opportunity for awesome decor is huge. You could do a woodsy, cabin thing or kitschy, fun sasquatch decor. So many fun things could be done. But sasquatch seems to be an afterthought in the decor here. A couple random statues and few pictures and a dusty, neglected glass case on the wall pretty much sum it up. Too bad. Such potential. Dark, sparsely decorated interior could use a good cleaning and pest control is needed badly as the flies were out of control. The food seemed fresh and tasted fine but ordinary. Ordered it from a boring menu that could tie in the Sasquatch theme but doesn't. My breakfast burrito was prepared nicely and had good flavor. The food prices are good and I liked the menu variety. The good news is the Verdi Coolers are quite good; vodka with fresh squeezed orange, lime or grapefruit juice and a splash of Sierra Mist. Refreshing! The drink specials were reasonably priced. Very friendly service, although quite slow and we had to ask for everything, including the check.   The outside patio is decent but bare, could use a splash of color like a couple flowerpots or music, etc.  The whole experience was a disappointing ""meh"" for me, and while it was not bad, it is not worth the drive for me.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"We've been trekking up here from Oro Valley for about 10 years with mostly good experiences, but don't know if we'll return. The owner has gotten a bit greedy, hiking prices significantly on food and drink offerings and stinting on service. For example, the 1/2 pitcher of margaritas that used to be in the $13-15 range is now $25. (They're still too sweet!) The formerly generous serving of chips (still described on their website as a ""bountiful basket"") and very good salsa has shrunk to a tiny bowl of about 12 chips accompanied by maybe 2 ozs of salsa. The food was never great but it's still OK; many dishes are under-seasoned, bordering on bland. Waiting 20 minutes for a server and another 20 for the check is not OK. With increased competition in the area, you'd think management would try to be more...well, competitive. That said, the overworked wait staff on a recent Saturday night was as attentive as they could be, and the live music was excellent.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

The waitress should have notified us that it was a $3 charge for a side of ranch when I asked for it that way we would not have been surprised by it in the end. Overall, we enjoyed our food and will return in the future, just won't order a side of ranch.

"Our party of 8 (4 adults, 4 kids) dined here for brunch on Sunday at 11:15am.  It is not a big restaurant, but does have ample parking. I had called ahead since we did have a slightly large party and was warned there might otherwise be a wait. They seated us immediately upon arrival at the table they'd set up for us, off to the side. It was nice to be out of everyone's way.  Whoever I had spoken with on the phone was very nice, and all the waitstaff was attentive and friendly. Our main waitress had a great attitude, and was especially patient and accommodating with the kids -- that's a bonus in my opinion!  The menu is quite expansive with many different options (reminiscent of a diner) and some color photos. Decent prices.   The food was good -- hot, fresh, and fast! I enjoyed my Eggs Benedict, my hubby liked his Creamed Chipped Beef (on the bland side but otherwise fine); one kid liked her Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Bagel; the other liked her Crêpe with strawberries.

They do have corkage if you care to bring your own nice bottle.  We did and were amused that our waiter called his colleagues over to our table to admire the bottle.

"I cannot say enough nice things about this place.  The environment is like nothing I have ever experienced.  Megan and her crew really worked hard to create a fun, new (yet old), exciting environment.  From the pool table, to the vintage furnishings, to the fun sayings painted on the walls, they really thought of everything.    Now to discuss Megan herself.  I have never met anyone, in my 30 years of getting my hair cut by barbers, who is as passionate about and amazing at the craft as she is.  She really gets it, and it shows with her cuts and customer service.  I get compliments all of the time on my fade.  In my opinion the haircut is worth a lot more than what they charge, so I always make a point to give a good tip.    If you are considering making an appt at Union Barbershop, DO IT ALREADY!  Please note, though, that if you are only available on evenings and weekends, you should make an appt.  Megan is amazing...she books up fast.  :)  I am so so happy I am one of her clients, and I am even more happy knowing I have sent several other happy customers her way.  Thanks for all of the great cuts, Megan!  Also, I feel it is important to mention that Union Barbershop is VERY welcoming.  Every time I come in they say hello, and the host greets me.

How about an ice tea to drink, sorry we're out of tea?  So that set most of the tone but the place is run like someone's dad opened a restaurant and told his kid hire all your friends. There is no sense of order and everyone just wanders about, disappearing for cigarette breaks etc. What I found most peculiar is that all the employees just wander behind the bar, grab the ice scoop with their bare hands then pour themselves something to drink (not alcohol as far as I could tell) the kid wiping the tables, the cook (I'm guessing), dishwasher everyone had a go at it.

"My dad was the ultimate builder/handyman so he spent a lot of time at Grant Road Lumber for all my growing up years. How strange to arrive in Tucson and see that this huge building now houses a new, trendy restaurant! I'm so glad they retained the iconic Grant Road Lumber sign in front as it is truly a Tucson landmark. Makes me predisposed to like Culinary Dropout, just because they were sensitive to the history of their building.   I think this place is really amazing. I love all the different areas where you can eat inside, or outside (with lots of misting fans to help against the heat). I love the couch seating area with fire pits. I love the games area and the stage for live performances of local groups. I love the enclosed bar area for a pub feel, if that's your thing. Fact is, I pretty much love everything they did to transform this building into a place where folks would want to congregate for food and community. I gather I'm not the only one who likes this place as I've heard it can be VERY crowded during peak hours. We came for a very late lunch and had no trouble being seated.   The chips and onion dip were great. I especially liked that the house made chips were not in the slightest bit greasy. And that dip was to die for. We also ordered steak tacos - three little street taco size bites with very tender and wonderfully flavored steak on them. The Brussel sprouts were also tasty - more on the tangy side than many I've had. One option we didn't take was a build your own anti pasti appetizer board. That looked like a fun adventure for a future visit.   The hostess who greeted and seated us was adorable and very friendly. She made you feel like she was glad you'd come. Waiters were also pleasant and very apologetic when the soup my brother ordered and waited for turned out to be no longer available. Prices are definitely on the high side for entrees but I didn't think the appetizers were all that expensive.   The reason I subtracted a star is because it is pretty noisy inside. Even at a time when the place was very sparsely occupied, it was a bit hard to hear so I hate to think what this place must be like when filled with lots of diners.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

They were still darn good charbroiled oysters though. The gumbo was pretty good too. For the main entree, we ordered a plate with really good grilled lobster, shrimp, and filet.

I called, they argued with me about my allergies and told me they would not make it, the kitchen closed, and they were unable to remove the items I mentioned and I didn't receive it like I said I got it on Friday. They also kept calling me a man after i told them I was a natural born woman.

I liked how they placed the slices of sharp provolone cheese at the very bottom of the bread, so when they poured the hot juices from the pork it naturally melted the cheese.  The roasted pork was flavorful and not too salty. The broccoli rabe on top had just enough bitterness to complement the richness of the pork.

I had things of value since we brought a few outfits with accessories, etc to try on and if I say not to come inside, I think it is only right that as the customer, my wishes are granted. I called to speak to the woman downstairs at the counter and she apologized and agreed with me and offered to provide us with $20 off our hotel bill as a courtesy. Ok, great. Then, the next morning, we woke up and the room had already been charged on a credit card that we were not planning on using to pay with but only reserved it under for the incidentals. When we spoke to another person at the front, they apologized, reversed the payment and then said they were going to deduct the $20 for the parking. Of course, they did not actually do this and the bill is still not accurate. I am not someone who is ever going to complain over $20 but now that it has become ""a thing"" and I am starting to get annoyed, I am slightly perturbed by this. Also, while the food at the Bistro is quite good and the staff are friendly, during peak brunch hours on a Sunday, they should have another person working to ring up the order while one prepares the food and drinks in the front and the other in the back by the griddle. We waited at least a half hour between placing order and getting our coffees and food. The location worked out for us nicely and the hotel really is comfortable and clean, but I am just left feeling slightly unsettled.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 3.0

"I am giving this restaurant 4 stars only because I am an extremely healthy eater & fitness junkie & there are very few options for a low carb meal. I got the baked catch of the day, which was drum fish with sautéed spinach. All the sides included either rice or potatoes or fries & I just wasn't having any of that so I got double spinach. The meal was absolutely delicious, but next time I will ask them to leave off all that oil & butter! I must have eaten 500 calories worth of oil & butter when that was not necessary for veggies & baked fish. The service was excellent & the restaurant was very clean. The restaurant smells absolutely delicious! The bill was very large. Have some extra cash in your pocket if you plan on eating here.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Much to be said about the professionalism of this place.  It's an old orphanage, I think.  It doesn't really look like it until you walk through the courtyard.  It looks like a haunted orphanage.  They could have filmed movies here.  Either way, Story Time.  I spend like 20 minutes waiting to get my room, because they have one person working the front desk, and 2 people eating, what I'm assuming, is lunch, even though it wasn't lunch time, watching said person working.  Their computer reservation system runs off of punch cards that come down from a dove courier system.  So I get my room key and walk through the movie set of a court yard.  Upon getting to my room, I hear that the TV is on.  I open the door to find a middle-aged European mother covering herself up as she plays with her iPad, screaming, ""what are you doing?!""  The husband (assuming) runs back from the bathroom, which is great because you're supposed to urinate after making biologies to prevent UTIs.  While this advice applies mainly to the female variety, it couldn't hurt the male to do the same.  So husband yells, ""You got the wrong room!""  ""aaahhH!!!  I got the wrong key!!!""  Yeah.  So I leave, going back down to the front desk, and down the spooky hallway comes someone with the right key.  I'm not sure who to blame for this mistake.  One could blame the the user, the human.  Or one could blame the computer system, the LeapFrog tablet device.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 2.0
"Nice little spot to stop for a quick bite to eat - great slices with a crispy crust and plenty of space to sit and enjoy. Their mozzarella sticks are not bad, but I've had better. Complaints?

The District Tap became a part of my weekly routine during the last 12 months. While electing to mostly do take out ordering in 2020 the wings became my go to order - with a side of fries of course.

"Don't listen to the bad reviews!!!! Of course this place gets a little busy when you go at prime hours. It shouldn't even be allowed on Yelp to give a place a bad review for being upset that a business was busy when you walked in. What legitimate business isn't busy during certain times?  Especially since -  1. It is the mall.  2. From someone who has lived in Tampa for 20 years, this is the best nail place in town, hands down, 100%.   I am actually upset that I am just discovering this place recently. First of all the prices are fantastic. Second of all they give the cleanest looking and most relaxing mani / pedi I have ever had at any budget. They really do a great job with the comfort and massage aspect which I have to say I was never the biggest fan of at nail only places before coming here.   I have been abt 4- 6 times and every time (I do gel) my mani / pedi lasted as long as I wanted and looked amazing the whole time! This is a huge surprise to me, as they typically last one or maybe two weeks max. It is because they do such a great job with such amazing detail. I go back when I think my mani / pedi has grown out too much, not because it is destroyed or peeled off. I love this place. I tell everyone about it - cannot say enough good things.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 5.0
Went to Khyber Pass Pub last evening with some friends and have to say I was a little disappointed.  After reading so many awesome Yelp reviews we were very excited to try the place out.  Dinner was at 8:00 and we were lucky to get seated right away.  The place was really loud so it was hard to hear what people were saying but we were expecting this since it is a bar atmosphere.  My husband ordered the bacon popcorn and he really enjoyed it but did say it was a little spicy.  He had the burger for an entree and I have to say this was very tasty.  Now on to the problem...I ordered the fried chicken cause I heard it was awesome.  What a disappointment this was.  The pieces were small and were very dried out.  The breading on the chicken reminded me of a shake and bake type of a texture and was one of the worst fried chickens I have ever had.  It's pretty bad when you say that Popeye's chicken was better.  I had the greens as one of my sides which was very very tasty and ordered a Big Ass Biscuit which was blah.  If you are calling something a Big Ass Biscuit it should be really big and not just the size of a Grands Pillsbury Biscuit.  It was very dried out and the butter the offered with it just crumbled the biscuit as you spread it.  My friend who is a Vegan ordered the sausage and she said it was her new favorite for this place.  It's very hard to find restaurants that have so many Vegan options on the menu and this place had a bunch so if your Vegan definitely try this place out.  All in all it wasn't a horrible place and the atmosphere and staff were awesome and friendly.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I think that overall I would give it about a 3.5 - usually I round up to be nice, but I think that this place is better than a 3 but not quite a 4. I also honestly believe that this is completely due to the price and the portion sizes. There are some pros and cons with this place.   We came in for lunch. For a place with the name ""cafe"" it is definitely a lot more expensive than one would think. We were very surprised to see the menu! It seems a bit strange to label this place a cafe considering the prices are on the higher end.   The decor is absolutely fabulous. I love that you can see the kitchen and the chefs preparing everything right in front of you. While we were there one of the owners was walking around checking on tables. Let me tell you that she is EVERYTHING. She looks like a damn celebrity and I was absolutely enamored. I want to look like that right now let alone in the future. She is also very kind to check up on all the tables and that personal touch is most definitely appreciated.   Our server suggested that we could order a few appys because neither of us were super hungry for a full main - especially not at lunch time. We went with the Kimchi Dumplings, the Beet Sliders and the Brussels sprouts. The sliders and brussels were good but what really stood out for me were the kimchi dumplings. They are tiny though - I probably could have eating like 10 of them easily.   I also don't understand why they purport these appetizer dishes as something you can share. It makes no sense that these ""sharing"" dishes would come in 3s. There are 3 dumplings and 3 sliders? How can I share that with someone if it is uneven? I'm not 100% sure why they do that or why any restaurant does this. I understand that there is an aesthetic component to any dish, but when you are serving such tiny portions and saying they can be shared at least provide us with something to share.   I randomly noticed however that all the alcohol products are reasonably priced. Which I thought was kind of funny. They also have some smoothies that look enticing.  Overall there are aspects of this place that I enjoyed. I think I will come back again because I am a vegetarian and I want to support places that are plant based.

Annually, I play in poker rooms all over Vegas, unlike many poker rooms this place felt new & fresh. Usually when the poker room is a cordoned off space on the main floor, the slot machines are overwhelmingly loud to the point that you can't hear yourself think. That wasn't the case here at all. The music played in the background but wasn't overpowering.   The players were all very friendly. It was like playing in a large home game, as everyone was catching up with everyone else.  The pit boss & dealers were also very friendly & very professional. The desk had a digital photo frame that slowly displayed pertinent information for upcoming tournaments & scheduled events.

"Can say with confidence that I will not return.  It's been my second try, and this is a huge letdown being born and raised in New Orleans.  First of all, there is no seasoning.  Second, prices are way too high if you're mirroring Louisiana.  Third, the creole gumbo was black and had no okra, which is considered a cardinal sin. Fourth, jambalaya tasted plain and had zero flavor.  Fifth, red beans and rice had only one piece of sausage.  Sixth, fries were overcooked just like the chicken.  Seventh, remoulade sauce was as flavorless as the napkin I used to spit my burnt fry into.  Eight, fried onion straws on the chicken sandwich was cold.  Ninth, overpriced for the amount of food you get.  Finally, blue cheese sauce was runny and lacked consistency.

"Finally found someone who wanted to go to this restaurant... in fact found two people but only one could go today so we did!  This is obviously a beer drinkers' paradise which was somewhat lost on us.. but we enjoyed perusing the lunch and dinner menus to find out about all their specials and the two time frame offerings  Since we were there at lunch time we ordered the veal leek sausage (me).. the other offerings were also calling out to me but I didn't want to miss the saurkraut and potato salad that accompanied these lunch plates.   My friend ordered the schnitzel lunch plate  ... yummy schnitzel!  My sausage had a bite to it ... I had never had this kind before and perhaps should have  stayed with a known sausage but ... the house mustards wee all wonderful, But I ran into a problem today that I'm sure other yelpers have encountered... when a cuisine is w/in your life and family experiences... you bring a different set of expectations.  For example, the saurkraut that my father made every fall/winter was far better (to me) than what DG served, as was the German potato salad my German heritage mother served.  Both DG offerings were GOOD but just not my favorites.   The service was impeccable - thanks Cory/Cary.. one of the best servers we've come across in a long time.  The back area seating was surrounded by beautiful plants and foilage and was one of the prettiest ""patios"" we've sat on in a long time... more than two hours as it was so pleasant.  I also ordered a to go slice of German Chocolate Cake which I had noted in prior reviews.  It was the biggest piece of cake I've ever been served in my life.... ($4.50) but once again a family history intruded .  My family used a lighter chocolate (isn't German chocolate a type of milk chocolate?) and as Corey pointed out , the DG version filing used less ""filling (probably condensed milk and pecans) and more plain coconut"".  A local bakery makes it especially for them and it was very rich.  The GCC most closely resembling my family's can be found at Wayne Kjar's on the mesa who made my wedding cake 34 years ago.

"As you walk down the long hall into the entrance of this speakeasy-style cocktail bar, you say to yourself, ""This has serious promise, I hope it doesn't disappoint!"" And by and large, it doesn't.   We went there on a Friday evening when we were visiting from out of town and looking for a quiet place to get a drink. The place had only been open about 5 weeks and it's obvious that they've put a lot of thought into the operation, even as they are still figuring a few details out.  The seating is comfy and structured to promote conversation. The music playing is a nice background but not too loud. There's enough lighting to see, but not overbearing and harsh.   Of course the drinks are a central piece of any cocktail bar and the ones we had were good. I had an Old Fashioned that was smooth and clean, with just enough palette to leave an impression and my wife had a minty gin drink that was very refreshing. The drink menu is a little sparse and could stand to have a couple of more signature drinks - I'd have liked to see something with some berries for the summer. An egg-white base option would be a useful addition and maybe a tequila-based option for that crowd.

"There is no vegetarian option. I don't eat meat but the ladies there helped me come to a solution. I got the ono poke and subbed the tuna for beets (I wanted tofu). My gf suggested poke, and we've had decent poke during time spent in BC, but I feel that maybe I don't know how it should taste? I didn't enjoy my poke all that much despite the care and attention the two ladies at the front gave my poke (meaning my gf's ono poke [w/ actual tuna] was pretty much neglected). The food was fresh but overall the taste just wasn't there for me. The ono sauce just tasted like soy sauce which is fine because it had enough salt but altogether there was nothing really special about it.

"This was probably one of the best craft beer and food festivals I've been to in Indy. (Thanks to Yelp for sending me there with a buddy to enjoy!) Although event parking was $10 in the lot or at White River State Park, we managed to park at the Circle Center garage and snake our way through the Indiana Convention Center (never know when it randomly decides to rain here...). $2 for a 3 hour event. Not to mention a good way to burn off the beer/bacon belly afterwards.  Victory Field was an awesome venue to host this event. Ample walking space, picnic tables, cup holders, standing bar type counters, and limitless stadium seating to enjoy my booze and bites. Numerous brewery reps were located along the entrance all the way around to the exit, making it a nice circle to make sure you didn't miss anything yummy. I have to give a shout-out to Upland in the concessions stand for the best seasonal release and most enthusiastic server ever. A 3 oz. pour of Barrel Chested Barleywine aged in bourbon barrels at a whopping 9.5% ABV. I should've gone back to get seconds! Totally a quick way to get a buzz. Another unique beer was from Scarlet Lane - the Coconut Dorian Stout. Simply delicious!   Lots of free bacon inspired dishes. Yes, I didn't have to pay for anything since all those samples filled me up. Actually...everything is included in the ticket price.  Soupremacy - Bacon corn chowder Stacked Pickle - BBQ bacon beef sliders Giordanos - Deep dish bacon pizza Harry & Izzy's - Bacon with grits Gigi's cupcakes - Bacon cupcakes, Chocolate cupcakes The District Tap - Jamaican flag pork skewers  Credits to (I can't remember all the names. Masses of bodies covering up the signs.): Bacon stuffed jalapeno peppers, glazed bacon, pork belly, bacon & sauerkraut, cheese and bacon croquettes, five-spiced bacon with crema, bacon stuffed jalapeno mozzerella breadsticks. Missed out on the popcorn, peach cobbler, and just passed on the marshmallows.  Thought we were going to leave early, but something about the ball field makes it very romantic and a good place to take a bunch of selfies.   I wish there would've been more giveaway/souvenir type trinkets to take home and a fun photobooth to print out memories. Perhaps, add this to the list next time!

"With varieties like ""Are you there, God? It's me, Margarita"" and ""I'm soy excited,"" East Nashville's Pied Piper Creamery proves you don't have to go to a major chain to get ice cream as cute as it is delicious.  Pied Piper, located next door to Beyond the Edge in East Nashville's Five Points district, offers several flavors of homemade ice cream ranging from the conventional to the creative.  They offer most of the cones, toppings, and flavors you'll find at Baskin Robbins (et al.) at a reasonable price.  But even more enticing than the ice cream (if you can believe it) is the atmosphere.  Pied Piper is located on the ground floor of what looks to the untrained eye like just another gentrified East Nashville home.  Outside you'll find a cozy and inviting porch perfect for Sunday afternoon lounging.  And inside, visitors are welcome to make themselves at home in a kid-friendly sitting area complete with a used book exchange.  With a friendly and talkative staff that is happy to make custom-order cakes, Pied Piper Creamery is just like one of those old fashioned ice cream parlors your grandpa always talks about...only more hip.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 5.0

In this area, an empty parking lot means one of two things - everyone is shopping or the food is awful. We learned that not only was the food awful but the service was worse!  No one greeted us at the door, so we headed for the bar. After 15 minutes, we found someone and asked for a menu, at this point we should have left, but no!  Another 10 minutes go by, a female bartender does us a favor and asks us if we are ready to order.We say ""yes"". She takes our menus, puts them in their spot behind the bar and walks away! We look for a manager, we have now spent over an hour in the horrible place and were beyond upset!  We explain our experience thus far and he tells us he knows all about it and we should ""have a nice night"". Well, we did!  We left and went across the street to Outback!

"Wines have terroir reflecting where the grapes grew--sun, gravel, clay, shade, wet, dry--and if you raise that to the nth, you find oysters. Fresh oysters should have a bit of the water where they lived, and many places ruin that by soaking them in local tap water.  Pearl's shucked oysters offered fresh and beautiful examples of east and west coast oysters and the differences between Atlantic and Pacific waters.  The combo pan roast had bay scallops, shrimp, crab, oysters, mussels, and clams in a light cream tomato broth, equally fresh and delicious.  Add warm sourdough and garlic bread and it was one of the best meals I've had in a long time.  But the bartender was gnawing on and popping gum and made zero effort to engage when I tried to start conversation.  Still, this is a fantastic treat.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I had friend cocktail envy because I found hers (De Rigueur) to be the best of the three. You really can't go wrong with any cocktail here though.   If it's whiskey you're after, or even another fine/rare spirit, VW will most likely have your potion. I can't speak to their weekend wait, but I'm sure getting a table might be hairy. A word to the wise, check them out on a week night. Besides, that's when Paul Rudd (swoooon), Jayson Werth, and Cole Hamels go.

Well my first life used to always be in kitchens.  I got one large King Leon Pizza.  The sauce is very tasty and they use a good cheese. That's all.   The crust is hard and very bland.  Meatball is the highlight and there was only 1 piece of meatball per slice of pizza. It  was an 8 slice pizza. About 2 ounces of meatball per slice of pizza.  On top the meatball is only located in one spot. Great ingredients but at the end it's a pizza. The highest cost for the pizza are the proteins then the cheese.    The crust was lacking any salt  and it was cooked long enough that the crust became cardboard. I would be as happy for pizza from Blaze or Dominos.

"Currie recently won Best New Spa in the Main Line, so I was excited to check them out. I needed a body wax in a bad way, and I had heard rumors of double-dipping at my former favorite Main Line area place, so I figured I'd give Currie a try. Apparently, Viviane is a star waxer there, but she was all booked, so I made an appointment (online--such a breeze) with Olga. I'm so glad I did; she was immediately friendly, warm, and funny, which always is helpful when you're having hair barbarically ripped from your body. Everything was clean, the front desk was lovely, and you can tip on your credit card (though they give it back to you in cash to then tip the service provider, but whatever, it's better than cash-only places.) I can't get over how nice Olga is, and she did a great job with  my wax. The only downside is the price--$90 with tip for something that usually cost me $45 in the city. But frankly, I just don't care. When you find someone who does their job well and is super chipper, with lots of availability, the price is worth it (at least until I can afford to just get this hair lasered off!) I'll be back to see Olga again, no doubt, and I'm curious to try the other services at Currie, too.  Just a note--Google maps seems to think that this is by Cole Wellness, further down Rt. 30, going towards the entrance to the Blue Route.

"Every time we eat here, my wife says,""we have to come back tomorrow."" I try to keep her somewhat under control but one of the great things about Fuji is that you can explore around and excellent center of Japanese cuisine and get more than the sushi, teppanaki or tempura and still keep coming back for more..   Tonight, we were in the mood for sushi and selected accordingly. Top on the list for flavor was the tuna guacamole roll, a tuna guacamole wrapped in a delicate salmon fillet.  The super fatty tuna and yellow tail rolls were exquisite. Sushi here makes me realize that grocery store sushi is an ethnic slur.  On the menu was also an entree of panko fried jumbo oysters that has tempted me several times but I wonder if my gout can take it..... its most likely worth the pain.  Desert, which I usually don't partake in but tonight seemed to be the appropriate filler was a superb banana tempura  and a lovely red bean paste on vanilla ice cream.  The best sushi I've had in a long time coupled with excellent service and a pleasant decor.

Save yourself some time and go to ANY other fast food place. If you want the details - see below.  I have actually been to this location twice - after saying I would never be back following the first trip. But it was Christmas, & my options were limited. For the first visit, we attempted to drive through. We sat waiting at the drive through order board for 15 minutes - after being told 2 times that they would be right with us. So we parked & went in for service - which was dismal. The second time, alas I knew better than to visit this location - we attempted to go inside - due to the several bright signs declaring that they were open on Christmas!! Imagine our surprise when we could not open the door - locked - tried the other door - also locked. There were people inside, but we were ignored. So we attempted to drive through. At this location, there are two options: lane a and b. So we drove up to a - nothing. A car pulled up beside us - their order is taken promptly. So we back up & go to that lane - nothing. At this point, I assume we are being punked. A car pulls up beside us at the other lane - their order is taken. FINALLY, we hear someone ask to take our order - the person seems annoyed we are there. We wait another 10 minutes to receive our food. Worst restaurant ever.   Honestly, it's no wonder that Chick-fil-a is about to surpass McDonald's as the country's premier fast food.

This one has yet to have the modernized upgrades to its appearance outside but I went at prime lunch-time, single lane drive thru (it's curbed in) packed and inside as well and I was through the drive through fairly quickly, I kid you not it was faster than I've been through a shorter drive thru in Springfield at lunch and rush hour.  My food was piping hot and excellent quality of Mcdonalds fast food.  The customer service I received at the windows was great, better than some Mcdonalds have been and they have A rating decals on the windows right now.  I also went inside for the bathroom and the place was very clean and newer inside.

This place sucks. First of all there's no complimentary breakfast like so many other hotels have these days. The only option is to pay $13 for a buffet which is insane. Their dining room which is right off the front lobby and the only place with table and chairs to work at is off limits unless you're dining. At 5:00pm I wanted to meet with several of my coworkers to work on a big presentation. Even though there was only one person dining in the area with 20 tables and chairs we were rudely told that we weren't allowed to sit there unless ordering off of their insanely expensive menu. When I complained I was told to move over to their couches which are very low and not good for getting work done. We asked if we could sit at a table outside and were also told that was off limits. At the other hotels I've stayed at they are always welcoming to anyone that ones to sit/work in that area. Not this place. Also my mini fridge in my room is very loud and the toilet is leaking and ran multiple times in the night. Boo Hilton!,Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 1.0
When you first walk in you are transported to a clean romantic French style cafe. The atmosphere made it worth it to dine here.  The food was definitely not worth the trip. The small plates of food are certainly not substantial. You would have to order 4-5 small plates at $12 a piece in order for one person to feel satisfied. I was underwhelmed with my fried pretzel sticks. Clear lack of exception. It tastes like sad burnt bread.

"The stars go to the decor and effort made to open up in our hood.  A large place indeed, two levels, one with a bar bar and one with a sushi bar, tables, booths, hence seating for everyone.  TV's unfortunately are in place.  Overall a nice non zen atmosphere just as we knew it would be.  The food was awful...as we kinda thought it might be, a mixture of rolls and Thai dishes and some others.  Pablo opted for the Pho Tai, which was lamentable, no flavor, no nuance, thought the beef was nice.  I had the Blue Ocean roll, not a roll person but they had provided a tablet so you could scan through the rolls and look out the prettiest.  It tasted of mess, day old Kroger sushi effort, none of the flavors were identifiable.  Perhaps I chose badly.  Service Ok, and the food came out in good time despite being busy, they had three lads at the sushi bar beavering away. There is a massive craft beer menu and cocktails and this is good as its close to home, pair this with something safe like a spicy tuna roll and methinks I will not have to moan.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"My left breast implant continues to migrate into my armpit, which is very visible in pictures taken for my modeling.   I cannot comprehend how Turkle is this incompetent of a surgeon, let alone that she demanded I undergo psychiatric evaluation - merely for being a trans woman - to receive the surgery, which I paid for in full. She shouldn't even be practicing, and I'm speaking as someone who undergoes cosmetic surgery at least annually. I'm having to have another surgeon clean up the disaster she caused in my breast region, and I'm sure she'll respond to this review by trying to get it removed or making her requirements for transgender surgeries even more stringent. Doesn't change that you suck really badly, Turkle. Anyone wanting a cordial, talented, reasonably priced surgeon needs to check out Dr. Zukowski in Wilmette, IL.

"This review is for my night stay one 03/22/14.  I was in the Reno area for a scuba diving trip. I had previously stayed at Circus Circus and the Sienna and didn't have many issues.  I went with The Ramada after a Priceline negotiation where you don't know what you will get.  I got the Ramada for $50 when everyone else seemed to be charging more than $100, big mistake.  As I entered the hotel I immediately noticed the type of clients they have. I seriously think is like a pimp/prostitute warehouse.  The clerk that checked me in was ok nothing above and beyond but not bad.  I was assigned room 1009 on the tenth floor.  The room seemed cozy and simply enough.  I then noticed there was a continues motorized noise about every minute or so. Come to find out the room is located right behind the elevator.  Needless to say it was a night full of hearing people going up and down the elevator.  I also found a long hair on one of the pillows and the shower head pipe was separating from the wall.  I drove to Dennys later in the night and saw a nice Days Inn was charging $39 for the night....I should have gone there",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 1.0

"I've tried a few Indian restaurants since I moved to Philly, but Ekta stands out as my favorite for several reasons.    The food:  My favorite dish is Biryani, so I use the house special as a sort of gauge for my first impressions of an Indian restaurant.  On my first visit, I ordered the Ekta Biryani, which had amazing flavor and generous portions of chicken, shrimp, and lamb.    The service:  After this first visit, I accidentally left my favorite winter hat at the restaurant, so I called and they told me they would look for it.  I prepared myself for never seeing the hat again, but late that night, someone from Ekta called to tell me they had found it and would hold it for me.    The food again:  I went the next day around lunch to pick up my hat and figured I would also order more food, since they had been kind enough to call me back about the hat.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala, which was just as fantastic as the Biryani.    The service again:  Since then, I have ordered several more times from Ekta.  They must have my name in their phone system because they call me by name when I phone in an order and treat me with familiarity and friendliness each time, both over the phone and when I pick up the food.  It's really simple, but I truly appreciate feeling like a regular customer who matters to a restaurant.  In my experience, Ekta treats their customers well.

We were from out of town visiting family and I found Rosie's on yelp because it was one of the few places that were open on a Sunday morning in the quaint town of downtown Zionsville. Of course, it was a little crowded, but they were able to sit us on the patio right away and our waiter, Andrew (he and the whole staff are a big reason this place gets 5 stars!) promptly met us after we made ourselves comfortable and took our drink order. He brought hot coffee and our waters out quickly and patiently answered all of our questions about the menu. He even said hello to my sweet puppy (who we were able to sit with on the patio - they are very dog-friendly!). I ordered the classic Eggs Benny, and it was DELICIOUS! Best hollandaise sauce I've ever tasted (they make it from scratch in-house) and the bacon was thick and cooked perfectly! The portion size was large, I couldn't finish the tasty roasted potatoes. My mom ordered the quiche, and it was also tasty - packed full of fresh veggies and filled her up (quiche usually leaves her still hungry). Dad's order of bacon and eggs came out perfect. We ordered a bowl of fruit to share and it was a great bowl with lots of FRESH variety - you could tell it hadn't been cut up and mixed together hours before but had been prepared just for us!

I cannot understand why so many people were eating lunch there yesterday. I ordered a turkey club $9.50 no fries & a teeny souffle cup of coleslaw containing maybe a tablespoon or two. The sandwich was soggy, running with mayo & the turkey roll (no kidding) was chewy to the point it was inedible. The waitress was nowhere to be seen. I ate the bacon and lettuce. I need to add that the sandwich was crammed onto a very small plate. Terrible.  My companion's tuna on a roll was better, but I was shocked the $6.75 sandwich grew by 85 cents when tomato was added. Again no fries & too much mayo.  The Onion rings we ordered were good. We got a small order. The ice tea was a mix and served in small water glasses. No refills were offered since the waitress was missing. When she came with the check, we asked for more tea which she brought. She never asked why most of our food was mangled and uneaten.

"Was really looking forward to trying this place, my wife is from NO so Cajun is pretty much a regular thing at our house. There were hits and misses here, but for the price it should have been mostly hits.   Service - Very friendly, but slow and disorganized.  Food - potstickers ok, wings way too smokey. Got the bourbon honey and still covered in cayenne. All of us at the table thought the heat level was way too high. Cajun flavor is way more than Tabasco and Tony's seasoning, which is all I could taste. Again, not horrible, but way not worth the $$$$.",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 3.0

"Four Points by Sheraton seemed like a great place for a group of friends to celebrate our friends 30th birthday- after booking 5 separate rooms, mainly as couples, we went to dinner, and then returned to the hotel to eat cake at around 10pm. Cake which one of our group literally carried cross-country for the trip. While conversing and singing happy birthday to our friend, a man knocked on our door- we went to the door and he was standing down the hall... very awkwardly... anyway he said that one of our neighbors was complaining about noise from our room. He appeared to be Sheraton staff but it was hard to tell as he was not dressed officially.   One of our group looked out of the peephole a few times over the next few minutes, and the guy was creeping around our door and listening in.  Honestly we were just eating cake prior to going out on Bourbon Street (the hotel is on Bourbon street- a LOUD street in the first place). We continued to celebrate her birthday, only to have the same creepy guy knock on our door again about five minutes later. He said that we needed to keep it down, once again, and that our direct neighbors were complaining about noise, and that the clients in the adjoining room were hotel VIP due to their point level.   Once again- this is a Hotel on bourbon street- and it's extremely loud in any room, period. We were not celebrating at 1am, or 2am, but at 10pm on a busy Bourbon street evening.  Anyway, we had not even been drinking in the room- and when we left to head out a few moments later, one of our group asked to speak with the manager to discuss the situation, as it seemed a little over-the-top in terms of their reaction. The manager on duty was immediately aggressive and loud, claiming that we were out of control- we asked him not to raise his voice but he continued to do so.  He told us again that the neighboring room was an important guest, and that we were disturbing them- he also threatened to kick us out... and that was after we approached management asking what the problem was.  In the end, we just walked away as a group and went about our night, as it was just not worth putting up with a clearly out of sorts management and staff.  I leave this review only because we felt as a group of sober individuals that the staffing of this Sheraton on Bourbon Street needs revamping.  Lastly- there are a lot of cockroaches in the rooms and halls of the facility- though it's hard to distinguish between them and the staff creeping about the place.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 1.0

"While I would still go here for breakfast, there is no way you could drag me here for lunch.  They didn't microwave my mini-burger above the point where the center was not ice...and sadly, yes. I said microwave. They are the frozen little things that you can probably buy at the grocery store with a ""Pale Palace"" type thing on it. Probably a Cyscos version.  The waiter admitted it was a pre-made that they tried to nuke.  And their Kulaches were nothing more than Johnson-er..town Better with Cheddar type of ""sausage"" cut in half and wrapped in thick dough. They didn't microwave that one above chilly either.  The girly's Tiger burger had no stripes to it. Or at least it didn't have the feta on there. It was at least above room temp.  I guess their kitchen focuses on breakfast and making doughnuts and that's fine. If you go there, stick to that. Seriously...stick to that.  Oh.

"There's great music on Bourbon St, but to get to it you have to dodge aging frat boys and girls gone wild, all vying for a spot on Tosh.0. The atmosphere on Frenchmen St is completely different. No strip clubs, souvenir shops, banks of daiquiri machines, or lines of police. The emphasis is on music, atmosphere, and people who can hold their liquor. For me, it was the New Orleans I was looking for, but assumed didn't actually exist.   There are lots of great clubs in the area, but The Spotted Cat was definitely my favorite. The bands I heard played old school dixieland and early 20th century jazz - although one did mix things up with a very interesting cover of Jefferson Airplane's ""White Rabbit"". They were extremely talented, and managed to sound very good for being stuffed in a corner. At least when I was there, there was no cover. Just a one drink minimum, and the drinks were reasonably priced relative to Bourbon St.   The crowd is a friendly and eclectic mix that runs the spectrum from local hipsters to Asian tourists, kids celebrating their 21st birthdays to senior citizens. No matter who you are or how you're dressed, you won't feel out of place. When the music's playing, it gets very hot and very crowed, yet people still manage to dance - and I mean actually *dance* (not me, but I can appreciate the skill). The crowd drifts in and out and expands onto the street, which is a nice benefit of New Orleans' liberal public drinking laws.  There are a couple of things which might put some people off.  First, it's tiny, with limited seating at the bar and around the periphery. Unless you get there early or between sets, chances are you will stand (or dance) the whole time.  Second, it's a very noisy crowd, so if you're a serious jazz aficionado, who wants to sit quietly and focus on the music, there might be better choices.  Still, for me this one of the highlights of this trip, and I'll definitely return if I'm back in town.",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 5.0

"Very diverse and fun crowd, I haven't tried their food though I have been and tried their alcohol as an after hours spot. Me and my friend usually go around 10 or so on a Saturday night and it is slowly becoming our go to spot if we don't want to head to Philly for drinks. We end up having a blast and usually feel safe enough to leave drunk ( no driving of course). Staff is okay, some of the security guards aren't very nice but no worries when the clientele is leaving the bar drunk there isn't much reason to be pleasant.   Our first night we asked for a long island ice tea and got a drink with lemon and a ton of vodka. It got us drunk very quickly which I wasn't a fan of. I have had a long island ice tea before and it didn't get me drunk that quickly, long islands for me are like a slow creeper that has me in denial that I might be drunk.   I have had a long island before tsk tsk to the bartender that tried to fool me, especially on my favorite drink.   But overall we have been there multiple times and will most likely be back, its good for a chill night with friends or a friend just to shoot pool, dance and get drunk.

"I have been to Acropolis three times now and I can't believe that it took me so long to start eating here. It is definitely becoming one of my favorite restaurants.   I LOVE Greek food. I crave feta, gyros and hummus and eat them regularly. I have had the gyros and Greek salad at Acropolis and they are amazing. However, on this last visit we were wanting to try something a little different.   We ordered Roasted Red Pepper Hummus and Tirokafteri (Feta with herbs) as an appetizer. Both of them are delicious. I personally prefer the flavor of the hummus while my Husband likes the Tirokafteri. We did have to ask for some hot sauce as the Tirokafteri is supposed to be hot and it was lacking heat and some flavor. The hot sauce made it much better.   For our entrees we ordered Chicken Santorini and Chicken Rhodes with greek potatoes and vegetables. These dishes were incredible! I had the Chicken Rhodes and the flavor was out of this world. The chicken was juicy. There was a nice lemony flavor that was complimented by the feta and artichokes. The greek potatoes are worth mentioning. Make sure you order them. They are perfectly seasoned and roasted. We are still raving about them weeks later. Even the roasted vegetables were well seasoned and tasty.  We also had amazing service! Our waiter was on point and our glasses were always full. We will definitely be back soon and it will be hard to order anything else on the menu since I don't see how they will top this meal.

I am hungry and I need food. I happen to stop in an Art Gallery and I asked rhe gentleman who had the best food around the area. He said Oceana. So I decided to check it out. I figured the food here must be great because there was a line out the building.    Once inside I decided to order the shrimp alfredo pasta. That dish runs you about $19 a plate. I love pasta especially from a cajun restaurant so I was ready. Once my food came out I was so disappointed with the way it looked. I felt robbed of a true pasta dish. It was more sauce than anything else. I am sure I injested more alfredo sauce than noodles and shrimp. I have definitely had better. The bowl was so shallow.

"A friend of mine treated me to lunch here for my birthday last week.  I'm always on the hunt for fresh, authentic Mexican cuisine, but I generally disregard any places that don't have at least 4 star average review. I saw Senor Taco had received some pretty impressive reviews, so I had to give it a try.  It looks quite unimpressive from the outside, but is quite nice inside. Bright decor, clean and comfortable seating. We were greeted right away by our server, who was very personable and attentive.   We started out with the complimentary chips and salsa - Ay, ay, ay amigo, that's some spicy salsa!! Tasty, but it definitely set my mouth on fire after each bite. For my meal, I went with one of the lunch combos, as did my friend. The portion size was gigantic. I enjoyed the enchiladas. The beans and rice were okay, but they never seem to be served as hot (temperature wise) as I'd like them to be.   We topped off our meal with an order of churros and fried ice cream. We probably shouldn't have done that, considering we couldn't even find enough room to finish our meals, but alas at least the desserts were very tasty!

"I think at the end of the day this is pretty much a 3.5 star place. It's not really as ""bad"" as a 3 but not quite on the 4 star level. The price slightly more than your average pizza place but it is in-line with any other place you sit down and eat at. Food was good, not amazing. Prices were reasonable. It sits in a strip mall so the ambiance outside it what it is, but inside it's nice, a bit on the low-light side. Service was good. In all, for where you're at I think you could certainly do a lot worse.   The wings were good, and were recommended as something to try. They were different in that they were not obnoxiously greasy or full of sauce. More of a dry roast with caramelized onions and some bread. Pretty good, easy to eat and I did not feel like I was whaling in the calories.   They say the pizza is ""well-done"" but it was not a bad thing. It was cooked just fine. We got the sausage & broccoli raub pizza and it was a pretty good combination. I ended up having 3 slices and we took the leftovers home and they warmed up well the next day. Pizza was balanced well, not too greasy. Solid.  The unsweetened tea was from a bottle which I didn't like since it was not endless refills. But it is what it is. We ended up coming here after a bike race on the way home. And for sure it hit the spot.

The side salads were great, mine had the dressing on the side; a good call, some others' salads were drowning in dressing.  3.  The char broiled oysters, which is inexplicably an apparent calling card, were floating in this oily substance that tasted like lighter fluid.

We ordered a pitcher of sangria with our food and when it came the distracted waiter accidentally spilled the ENTIRE pitcher of wine all over me. I mean the ENTIRE pitcher. My shirt, pants, even my underwear was soaked. To top it off, this was one of my favorite, more expensive dry clean only outfits.  The waiter was understandably apologetic. I tried to wash up in the bathroom but I ended up feeling sticky for the entire meal. Luckily one of my friends had a spare undershirt but I was still so uncomfortable, wet and sticky.

"My first time experience at the Metropolis Mall studio was a total disappointment from the moment I walked in. I took my 18 month old grandson in for a scheduled appointment. There was no greeting or introduction, just a nod.  The photographer did not introduce herself to me or I would address her lack of professionalism by name.   Neither her or her assistant helped me in any way with my grandson or with props.  When one went out of camera vision, it was up to me to watch my grandson while retrieving his toys.  When he didn't want to sit for the ""side views"" , the photographers said that they were mandatory shots and that she must take a certain number of him on the black background. He is a baby....he didn't want to sit on the stool and stare to the side!!   There was no concern for what type of pictures I wanted, it was about what she was required to take! Oh, and then the sale pitch started!  I get it, they must sell packages in order to pay their bills but seriously I told her I wasn't spending $657.00 on pictures!!

Our room was clean and the staff was very friendly. They also have free shuttles, which we used to get to the septa station on 30th to buy all day bus and trolley passes instead of driving into the city,  which BTW worked out very well. (the independence pass comes with free phlash bus rides) The bus stop was right in front of the hotel,  just walk across the city Ave bridge and your there.  Having a target next door was also pretty awesome,  we bought some juice and snacks when we went and relaxed in the room.

"Legendary, bucketlist style.  Worth the trip all the way to the Big Easy by itself.  Ruined during Katrina/Rita and brought back to life by volunteers and the community, Dooky and Leah are institutions.  You must meet them.  Lil Dooky is doin his thing in the kitchen now.  As Leah said, ""He went up to Cordon Bleu, and then came back down so I could give him some Cordon Noir.""  Big enough that you can always get a seat midday.  The fried chicken is hands down the best in the country.  Half hour wait is nothing for this chicken.  I'd wait an hour.  So good I stuffed some in my suitcase to bring back to Boston.  No joke.  Dooky told me I was crazy.  He's right...crazy for that chicken for sure.  The buffet is excellent.  The peach cobbler is great if you have room at the end.  That's a big if.  The service is always good and mostly related to the Chases.  Decades of presidents have dined here, Louis Armstrong and Muhammad Ali, too.  Arguably the best collection of African American art in the world.  Do yourself a favor.  They're only open for lunch, so countless people taking meetings while they dine.  I go once when I visit and then again on my way to the airport home.  It's that good.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"The Culinary Adventures of Tom Coghlan January 26, 2019 ·  · When I entered Pod, at 3636 Sansom St. in University City I thought I was in a bar from Star Wars! The drywall in the bi-level ultra-modern Pan Asian Restaurant was brightly painted with a high gloss gel paint reserved primarily for fiberglass automotive and boating applications! It was hard to believe that this Starr Restaurant, the tenth in my Starr Restaurant series, was 18 years old! The color changing lighting was amazing for today's standards let alone those of 18 years ago! I found a single seat at the bar and met my server, Anthony. I started with a LEMON LOTUS, Smirnoff vodka, sparkling wine, lavender, poppy seed, lemon foam. It was VERY refreshing! So much so, that I finished it and ordered another before deciding on my meal... After reviewing the large menu with its abundance of choices, I ordered Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice, crispy rice, serrano chili (4 pieces), Chicken Pot stickers, mustard aioli, Caterpillar, fresh water eel, mango, cucumber, avocado, eel sauce, and Calamari Salad, kale, avocado, miso sambal dressing. I asked Anthony, who was a wealth of information, answering the many questions I had before ordering, what wine he would suggest. GRUNER VELTLINER HUGO, Minerality, green apple, peaches from Southern Austria was his reply... I agreed! When the Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice arrived, I was in awe at the presentation! It was beautiful! The rice that the tuna was served on was deep fried, making it a bit crispy. The FRESH Tuna was more than ample and topped with a small slice of serrano pepper. For me it was a two-bite endeavor with the serrano in one of them!  I immediately knew which bite included the serrano!  WOW! I was truly impressed! I never knew sushi could taste so good! And the wine was PERFECT! I couldn't wait for my next course! The Chicken Pot Stickers arrived, and i must apologize... I can't find the picture. They were served with a Mustard Aioli. By Mustard Aloi I mean Chinese Mustard Aloi! They were WONDERFULl ! After that Anthony brought me the Caterpillar Roll. Again, a BEAUTIFUL presentation! It looked a lot like a caterpillar! Anthony informed me that a dried fish was grated on top of the roll and resembled the hairs on a caterpillar. It lended a complimentary flavor to the roll that was subtle yet prevalent. Again, I NEVER KNEW SUSHI COULD TASTE SO GOOD!!! And the wine remained perfect!  Then the Calamari Salad arrived! The Calamari was breaded and deep fried and tossed in a bowl with kale, avocado and a miso dressing. AGAIN! It was AMAZING! The back lighting in the pics may make it a bit hard to see clearly, but if you click on the pics. I hope you can get a good idea of what is going on.     https://podrestaurant.com/?utm_source=Google%20My%20Business&utm6_medium=Website%20Button",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"This is my 5th time frequenting gallery pastry shop since moving here in July. I am now 8 months pregnant and the croissant & gravy has been one of my cravings ever since ordering it at the restaurant several months ago. I can't recommend it enough. Unfortunately, the past two times, my experience ordering it has been under par.  The item is not listed on their online menu for pickup. I called to order it in and unfortunately my name was not taken and the staff was very out of touch with how their online menu presents. I took this with a grain of salt recognizing the hectic times we're in. I showed up to the restaurant and basically re-ordered and paid. Now expecting a fresh order of croissant & gravy. I sat waiting for close to ten min before another hostess asked me about my order and guided me to the outdoor hostess stand handing me my to-go order. I have no idea how long it was sitting out there and was quite disappointed to see less gravy on the order than the past times. :/  I appreciate the chefs and quality of food at this establishment! However, due to the disappointing service and lack of communication- I am probably better off learning to make my own gravy from now on.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Definitely try the chef's table if you have the party size and everyone is game for it. They don't lie when they say you'll be full by the end. With a menu full of delicious home-made pastas and a seemingly endless variety of specials, especially when they do monthly specials like a ""Macaroni and Cheese"" menu or a Ravioli menu, while these seem gimmicky, Pop Shop does the same thing and while it greatly expands the menu it also ensures that there is something for everyone.  We go there with friends often and service is usually pretty fast and although we usually have a variety of servers, they are all normally friendly. The owner/chef is also very sociable and usually makes it a point to stop by every table at least to say hello.  I can't really say anything negative about That's Amore. The bread is great- and plentiful. The sauce that comes with the bread is equally amazing. I'm not sure what they're called but one of the appetizers that are breaded rice balls are very good and we order those every time we go there.  The space is overly packed, though and it's difficult to navigate but that isn't enough to take off any stars or anything like that, once you're seated who cares how hard it is to navigate!  Although some of their pastas are homemade (indicated by their menu) it doesn't seem like they all are. If they limited the amount of pastas offered and only offered homemade, I think that would be something that would certainly set them apart from the competition.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"So, I always read the reviews by other Yelp'ers before I choose a place to stay or eat...but when you travel for business you don't always get that luxury.  Instead I headed to Nashville and went right from the airport to the Sheraton Downtown.  I found the reception desk attendants very pleasant and quite helpful.  I was provided a room on the concierge level and it was well appointed.  The view of the city from my room was spectacular.   Once settled in I headed over to the ""goody"" room for a glass of wine and some treats before settling in for the night.  There were both hot and cold appetizers as well as fruit, cookies, water and juice.  They offered several wines, and the gentleman who managed the room was totally engaging!  The next morning I met with a business partner for breakfast and took advantage of the restaurant.  The food was good as was the service...no complaints there.  After my team's meeting a block from the hotel we came back to discuss the day's event before heading to the airport.  The bar area was a perfect place with many seating options from leather couches and chairs to tables in quiet and more social areas.    All in all, my experience was excellent.  So for the other Yelp folks who didn't have as nice a time as I did, I'm sorry to hear that....perhaps next time will be different.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 4.0

I watched them turn over tables  without sanitizing the area. Not even a wet rag. The floor was so sticky you were suction cupped to the floor as you walked.

"The first time I went to Shifty's, which was maybe a couple months after they opened, the seitan tacos were literally life-changing. I had never had seitan cooked so perfectly, in perfectly sized pieces, and it was doused liberally but not overwhelmingly in the amazing pomegranate mole sauce they cook it in. I wanted to marry them.  The second time, a couple months later, the seitan was still good but didn't nearly live up to my original experience. The chunks were bigger and not as amazing of a texture, and there was no extra sauce to be found. This time I also mixed and matched with a fish taco, and it was really good.  So, maybe inconsistent, but tasty, reasonably priced, and great service. I'll definitely give it another try.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"CC's is a local chain coffee shop in New Orleans. In terms of look and feel, it falls somewhere between tattooed baristas at the hipster joint and fully corporate national chains. It lacks the funky friendliness of smaller businesses, but avoids the snobbish nature of holier-than-thou spots.   All that to say -- it's fine.  I got an iced coffee and drank it quickly, as the taste left much to be desired and without the smooth flavor of a cold pressed brew, I was just in it for the caffeine.  The bakery case held nothing for gluten free folks like me. I was able to scrounge together enough snacks to create a halfway decent breakfast. The ""Picnic in the Park Bistro Box"" was pleasant, with fruit and nuts and cheese. I also picked up a Sweet Street marshmallow treat, which was delightful.   The tables on the patio are nice. The furniture isn't rickety, and you get a great view of the sidewalk and the pretty houses on Esplanade.  I would visit again, but only if my options were CC's or Starbucks. I'd still take a privately-owned shop as my first choice.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I love the whole concept of North Bowl. Rarely can you find a place that so effortlessly caters to kids and adults alike. I've heard a lot about this joint, and was thrilled to finally have the chance to give it a go.  I popped in around 6:30 pm on a Friday, keen for a happy hour. The outdoor bar offered a more limited menu and informed us that HH had ended at 5pm. However, the inside bar still had some specials going until 7 - so into the air conditioning we went. The bar sits off in it's own little space which I imagine comes in handy if/when kiddos are running about. The inside bar had different beers, but a bigger selection on tap and a couple of specialty drinks to choose from, too. Prices ranging from $3-10 depending on the drink and if it's happy hour.   For a place with ""bowl"" in it's name, there's only about 10-12ish bowling lanes. We didn't come to bowl, so I'm not sure on wait times/ prices/ reservations/ etc., but I imagine it could get backed up on a busy day. There's plenty of seating, and the upstairs bar offers some modern chairs and couches and a bunch of awesome arcade games to pass the time. That to say, the name North Bowl is slightly misleading - this is more of a chill hang that happens to offer bowling. It's a very solid place to grab a drink, have a nice conversation, or just kickback. There's indoor and outdoor space to hang. Parking in this area is touch and go. It's free street parking for the most part, but just be sure you're paying attention to the signs.

"I went to Salon Bass after reading reviews on Yelp. I have naturally brown hair but always like to dye it a bit darker, and it always seemed to come out dull and boring. I went to Garrett with 2 pictures of color I liked, which was a dark brown with coppery/light brown highlights. Garrett is a genius. He put in the most subtle highlights that were not too obvious but definitely added depth to my usually boring brown, and he somehow darkened it the perfect amount at the same time.  After spending time in the sun my hair lightened up a bit, so I was back not long after to get a dark glaze to tone down the highlights. The glaze was perfect - it darkened my whole head up but still allowed the highlights to shine through, which was perfect for my new job and for fall coming up. The glaze was only $30 - on my first visit I asked Garrett how long I should wait to come in for my next color appointment but he told me that I could just do a glaze if I wanted, which is much cheaper than color - he cares about what is best for the client rather than making money - and he will make more money in the long run because I will be back many, many times!  During my glaze I also mentioned wanting to make an appointment to get my hair cut, and Garrett stayed late to cut my hair. He really listened to what I wanted and did a perfect job.  While I was in the salon for the later appointment, a man came in who had gotten a terrible haircut a few blocks away and needed it fixed immediately for his first day of work the next day. Joe stopped what he was doing and made time to help this guy, whose hair really was butchered, and he worked his magic and completely fixed it.

We found this while looking for a place to get a small bite before a movie. Saw the grilled cheese sandwich on the menu and ordered that along with a glass of wine. Thank goodness they didn't make the wine! We should have known things weren't going to be good when they asked if we wanted a pickle OR chips with the sandwich. Huh? How much does a slice of pickle cost? $18.50 later..........terrible grilled cheese and they asked for the tip before they even started the sandwich. And they didn't bring the chips- we had to go back and remind them. So much for the tip for service.

"When you walk up to Bru Burger, you will come to outside sitting area and a nice modern look. The outside area was busy at this time just as the whole restaurant was. I enjoyed the atmosphere from when you entered to clean establishment with a wonderful looking bar as you entered. From the chalkboard beer list behind the bar to the art, specifically the view from my table of the city looked great and brought a flow and inviting mood to the place. The place was loud with good times and laughter. Although, at times it was almost too loud, as it seems that the other tables are ""right on top of you.""  My family and I came at a busy time, which meant that we had a 45 minute wait in front of us. The wait was worth it and the staffs friendly helped with the situation. The host at the front was polite and assured us that they would get us in as fast as possible. When we were sat, the server greeted us in a good time even with the volume of people that were there throughout my dining experience. Our drinks came back quickly and our food came back with what seemed to be even quicker. Overall, I thought the service was polite and greatly timed considering how busy the place was.  If you are looking for a good place to find burgers and fries this is the place to go. The meals were served on uniquely shaped plates and the presentation was great. I had the Memphis barbeque melt and it tasted good. Nothing to special about the barbeque or pulled pork but worth the money paid for it. I would order again but with the variety on the menu I would have to try something else in the future.

"This was an impulse purchase after a long day at work and a tweet from BreweryARS. Ramble parks outside BreweryARS on Thursdays so I saw a tweet from ARS promoting this crazy pickle pizza special. I live in Kensington - so a good 20 minute drive away from this place but this Pickle Pizza special was worth the effort! My husband called in the order and had no issues picking it up.   I will say I had the pizza about 1-2hours after we picked it up (see long day at work). My husband kept it in the oven on warm and it held up well. When I got home I was more than stoked to see him pull this gorgeous large pizza out of the oven. It tasted just as good as it looked! The pickles were fresh and crunchy and the tzatziki sauce with dill was a perfect compliment. The crust was thin and sturdy - like it didn't flop around and wasn't soggy at all. This was some bomb pizza and even though it's far, I'd make the trip for this pizza again.

"The Amazing Ben did my son's 5th birthday party, and wow did he set the bar high. I did go for all the bells and whistles so my kid could participate in the magic show and the tunnel thing after. It was perfect for his age group. I thought the bounce time was a little small, but it really was enough to allow them to sit still through the magic show. And while the kids bounced, Amazing Ben learned all their names while bouncing and used those names in the magic show. He lived up to his name! The room is nothing fancy, but my son is seven now, and he still says that was his best birthday party by far.   We invited the whole class to a party on Friday night. We had 24 kids, and most parents dropped off. Amazing Ben did it all. He was professional and even called before the day to find out what my son was into. The kids laughed so hard.    It was the perfect party.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 5.0

"The only reason I'm giving one star is because they did let me return one thing. I tried to return multiple stuff that was not worn and the only reason the tag was not on an item is because trying it on, it ripped off. (Skirt) When I asked to return it she said yeah no problem just remember to have the tag attached, even though you brought it. Minuets later she looked at another employee and said, so it's only able to be exchanged since the tag wasn't actually attached. Whatever the policy is was changed by the look of another employee. And it would be helpful to know this information. I asked for a gift card since I was in the rush and they couldn't even do that. She even mentioned *some* managers do not even accept clothes without tags attached for exchanges. So whatever there policy is needs to stay consistent and not determined by what manager is working or by looking at there facial expressions. And I suggest an older manager that wants to help guests come back to shop there , instead of turning them away.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 1.0
"I'd rather go to On The Border in Neshaminy!!!! The hostesses were terribly rude. I caught the hostess rolling her eyes and cursing off another customer. Our wait was an hour. We weren't terribly hungry, so we decided to take the wait time. An hour later we were still waiting. My fiancée went to ask th hostess how much longer, her response was , "" I don't know, you've been waiting about an hour"". After that, my fiancée looked back at a section that had empty tables. We asked why we couldn't be seated there. The hostess told us she forgot about that section, and we all could be seated there. Now I was really mad. The waitress we had was nice and friendly. She knew how to take care of her guests. She promptly gave us chips and salsa. She took our drink and food orders; she also was fabolous itch watching a food allergy of mine!!  The food is was poor to fair. The chips were good, but everything else was terrible. My fiancée ordered chicken tacos. They were dinky and priced unfair. He did not get a side, and it looked like the cook threw it on a plate half done!! I had the steak chimichanga. The chimichanga itsself wasn't bad( a little spicy, but not terrible), but the refried beans were more like black beans. They were spicy and over powered with pepper.Overall, a terrible experience, we will not be back.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 1.0

"If I could give less then 1 star I would. We have gone to Kobe for years, but tonight was inexcusable and we will likely not return. The table we sat at had next to no a/c, after we and the party next to us complained the manager did something and offered free drinks. The chef started to cook and placed the eggs on a visible hot spot and allowed them to burn while giving us yummy sauce. Despite burnt eggs, the rice was undercooked prior to frying and was hard. Chef proceeded to cook the noodles in the same hot spot but at least didn't scrape and they were edible. At this point, we realized free drinks didn't come and my husband had to retrieve them. As the veggies were served they were turned down by another patron and the chef scooped them off the plate and added them back to the grill(cross contamination)!!!  The kicker was when he pulled out the beef and it was brown with some red spots and tried to tell us it was seasoned. I took the attached picture as he placed it on the grill and got the manager.

"On the hottest day of the summer it was nice to slip inside Triumph Brewing Company and enjoy the dim lights and heavy air conditioning. A few brave souls sat outside, but after standing in the humid 90 degree heat at The Garden of Reflection to commemorate 9.11, there was no way I wanted more of it.  Today, the sun won.   My first visit here in New Hope, and the facility was spacious with big bar on one side, and dining room on the other.  We sat is a dark corner to discuss business although part of my mind and all my heart was elsewhere.  Triumph is proud that it locally sources its provisions and is serious about sustainable agriculture.  Way cool!    I had a half sized Watermelon Salad consisting of red and yellow sweet melon with Watercress and a light dressing.  It was exactly right for today - cool, pleasantly refreshing.  I read on Yelp that the Calamari was good, so when the wait person suggested that or Grilled Chicken, Beef, or Shrimp on the salad, I jumped at the squid.  It was not on top of the salad, but in a separate plate because there was so much of it.  Tasted like good Calamari should - crisp without oiliness, nicely spiced to offset the innate mildness of the crustacean. I took most of it home.    Sorry to say, it was too early to try any of the beer, and the heat would have turned the day into an Albert Camus novel. So, will return again to explore that end of the menu.  A very nice place, adequate parking (metered), and better than average healthy food. Very satisfied, and plan on going back soon.

The assortment of Lego that is available here is the best bar none in all of Edmonton. The wall of colourful blocks at the back of the store is also quite awesome.

"In the US in 2012, consumers are used to merchants fawning over them, no matter how idiotic or ignorant the consumer is. Indeed, ""the customer is always right"" is the mantra of the day. The owner of this shop is from the old country (Russia?) and doesn't give F*** about that mantra, and that's actually a good thing.  I walk in with a violin we rent from him that appeared to be defective. He takes the violin, proceeds to tell me that I'm a tard and shouldn't F*** with the violin in the way I was trying to F*** with it, tells me I didn't put the violin in the case properly, tells me I didn't store the bow properly, and even tells me that I didn't use the zipper properly - essentially I'm an incompetent monkey.  He was so condescending I was chuckling throughout the lecture. But he was *RIGHT*. And I learned quite a few things.  How might this transaction have occurred in a more traditional shop? ""We are so sorry, sir. We'll take care of that one. Here's another violin."" I learn nothing, think the violin is F'ed instead that I'm a tard, and don't have my delicate self-esteem hurt.  We're so used to ""everyone is right"" that we're regressing. A Playboy playmate knows more about autism than PhDs and MDs who spend their lives studying it. Someone who barely graduated from high school is more qualified to homeschool their own kids than professional teachers. etc. etc. etc. It felt refreshingly good to walk into a store and have someone just tell me that I'm a F'ing idiot and then tell me how to stop being a F'ing idiot.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 5.0

"Given that this place is so highly rated on Yelp, combined with the fact that they serve Afghan food, I just knew I had to try it!  After reading through all the reviews on Yelp, my friend and I just knew we had to try the Emperor Platter. According to their menu, it is designed for 2 (but could easily be split among 3 people). It starts with an appetizer, including shirazi salad and eggplant boorani accompanied by pita bread. This was actually my favorite part of the meal. The eggplant boorani was so delicious and served at the perfect temperature. For the main course, you get lamb kabob, chicken kabob, and one koobideh kabob (which I'm pretty sure was beef). The meat was pretty good, but nothing amazing. The platter also comes with grilled tomato and rice. In terms of proportions, my friend and I noted that about half of the plate was rice and half was meat. The platter comes with two different types of rice (a brown and a white). I thought the rice tasted really good. Overall, I thought the dish was pretty good but would probably try something else next time.  In addition to the Emperor Platter, I also had the mango smoothie, which was delicious (although a little bit on the small side). In terms of service, I thought we were well-attended to. In terms of noise/ambiance, I thought the place was unassuming and pretty quiet. It is worth noting we came in the afternoon on a Sunday, which I would recommend (considering people say this place gets packed). Finally, check-in on Yelp for 10% off your bill. In sum, if you're looking for a new and different place to try, you should definitely hit up Sameem Afghan Restaurant.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I never noticed this shop until this past weekend, walking across the little bridge from where we parked the car. My boyfriend and I both noticed it at the same time, looked at each other, and said ""Omg, let's go."" We love creepy.  It's packed to the brim with antique bird cages, skulls of various creatures, stereoscopic photo viewers, antique vibrators, wicker caskets, human hair jewelry, antique embalming equipment- just about anything pertaining to death, undertaking, and funerals, mixed in with odd and fascinating doo-dads and trinkets. We spent awhile in the shop, poking around at curiosities, while the owner was speaking to someone. We were making our way back out when he stopped us, asking what it is that we each find the most interesting. Boyfriend said the old medical equipment; I said the animal skulls. The owner proceeded to give us a tour of the shop, pointing out all of the strange skulls you have to wonder how someone came across- a giraffe, even a dolphin which wasn't for sale. He then delved into the counter case, showing us the hair jewelry. He, and his goods, were fascinating. We went in without intent of buying, and didn't make a purchase, but came out with thoughts of saving up to buy that horse skull for the mantle at home.  I won't give away the secret, but if you're ever lucky enough to have time to speak to the owner, don't leave without seeing his aluminum ring collection.

The green curry is more creamy (coconut creamy) than the usual green curry, which just makes it perfect for my taste buds! I love it. The right amount of creamy mixed with the righ amount of spice.

Dr. Reichman is an amazing doctor. I wish I could say the same for the staff upfront. I switched insurance and at the time of making the appointment I gave all my new information to reception.

I asked to pay out of pocket because of the cost of the airfare to go home all the receptionist could do was blame me. When I asked why they wouldn't call before the day before she blamed me and said it's my responsibility to make sure my insurance is accepted. Im was stunned at how rude and dismissive.

La Ronde is a very higher end restaurant in downtown Edmonton.  It is located on the 24th floor of Crowne Plaza Chateau Lacombe Hotel.   I think it takes about an hour or so to fully rotate.  It's slow moving so no one gets sick! The food at La Ronde is good.  It's very fancy.  In my experience, fancy, high-priced food usually doesn't have much taste.  La Ronde isn't really an exception.  I like the food but I don't think it's anything to brag about.   It is a very romantic place for a date though.  If you're aiming to impress, La Ronde can definitely help you in your quest!  They even have a Lover's Delight section on their menu.   I enjoy going to La Ronde for the view of the city, the swanky atmosphere and the piano player (they usually have someone on the piano or singing as entertainment).",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"What a wonderful treat to visit the beautiful corridors of the Roosevelt Hotel during the holidays! Every nook and cranny is filled with white lights, Christmas trees, delicate ornaments, wreaths, and floral decor. With the corridors aglow, it beckons guests and visitors to take photos and relish in the spirit of the season. There's also a wonderful gingerbread house in the hotel café, which pays tribute to the beginning of the hotel in 1893. The gingerbread house is adorned with beautiful candies and lots of colorful icing.   After taking in the holiday sights, the hotel boasts several great options for food and libations. The Sazarac Bar features classic cocktails along with their namesake drink. Also, The Fountain Lounge has a bar, restaurant, and live entertainment (piano and various bands). Finally, Domenica Restaurant boasts great pizzas and other Italian fare, with a full bar.

"AWFUL EXPERIENCE, DO NOT CHOOSE THIS HOTEL!  BE CAREFUL! THEY STEAL YOUR MONEY! NOT A SAFE HOTEL!   We did not get the room cleaned in our stay  It was a huge fight  between the housekeeping memebers screaming loudly outside the room guests without any consideration and ethics. It was in the morning! How awful to wake up with those Screamings. I have never seen a fight like that.. Awful  911 had to arrive later.  Housekeeping did a mess by drop coffee and cups. So after the check out my family and me were accused of that and also of scratch the walls and also accused for dropping the towels on the floor (that is the Only thing we did)  Did housekeeping did those scratches and drop the coffe to accuse us for revenge as we complaint about that we did no get the housekeeping service? Or Maybe they thought i  accused us about the fight as i got out of my room to take breakfast and they were all there in front of me.  Or did the scratches were from other guest who had a kid and accused us... Adding the coffee on the floor in purpose?   I dont know why they did that but they charge 500 dollars.  In the beginning was 250 but after we complaint to the general manager she added 250 more...   The manager assistant was extremely rude. When we arrived so confused and worried of why that happened he treated us so bad threatening us to call the POLICE. My parents who are senior were also threatened.

"Very Dissapointed:(  I cannot believe some people are employed here and have no boss?  Crazy right?  Apparently you can't complain to anyone on the service you recieved or how you were lied to??? Beside's there $10.00 fee to get in. Although, they did make it worth while, for the first time they offered $100 table play or slot play. Unfortunately I used there free valet parking... The valet attendant left my lights on and killed my car battery!  OK,  mistakes happen. But your a casino! Don't you think they would offer compensation for a mistake they made?????  I guess not... :(  If you EVER have any problems and anyone tells you they will comp you or correct a problem, GET IT IN WRITING! Here's WHY: Saturday night, the manager / supervisor of the valet told me they would jump start my battery and send my information to Risk Management.  On Monday I should hear from them to get a new car battery since they killed mine.  He offered me free dinner, but we already ate.  He told me they would comp me for the next time we come for dinner / Club 7 / whatever.  Also he managed to get me $30 in free slot play while I had to wait for a tow truck...Great right?? WRONG!     LORI from Risk Management never called me Monday, I had to email and call the casino myself, numerous times.  She finally left me a message 2 weeks later, that they are processing my claim and I should hear from there insurance company any day. NOT! I called the following week.  Now I was told the Valet manager never told me I would get a new battery.  That since my battery recharged itself after getting two jumps in one night, that I don't need a new battery!  Unbelievable! She told me she would check with the valet guy again to see if he told me the wrong info and get back to me.  Two days later she called, told me she has the resolution and to call her back.  I tried calling no answer.   Once I finally got a hold of her she told me the casino won't be replacing my car battery.  That I was comped $30 in free slot play while I waited and that was it. Unbelievable!  I have a 2008 Mazda it's not some crappy car that has problems with it.  They ruined my battery, I Left the casino, had to get gas (I lived 1 hour away) and my battery died again at a gas station. Had to get it jumped again and had a very bad night due to this casino.  You would think after bringing 6 people to this casino and all of us spent and lost over $2000 + that they would be smart enough to make sure there customers were happy & treated with respect instead of calling them a liar? Oh and Lori couldn't direct me to her Boss...she doesn't have one.  She is the highest person to complain to???  WOW!    Funny how she was processing my claim the first week, but the next two weeks it was all made up?  I would have never called them to ask for the battery if I wasn't told I would receive a new one.

The kitchenette in my room was literally right next to the bed which was weird.   When the maids roll the cart outside the room it sounds like booming thunder. When the AC goes off you can hear so much noise in the open area within the hotel. I had to wear ear plugs not only for the noise but because the AC was very loud.  Ask for a quiet outside room away from the lobby.  My mattress was old and very soft. Not comfortable. Room 226 time to replace it.  Otherwise the staff was very pleasant and I was traveling alone.

"Musical aspirations aside, Steve &Thao, the owners of BridgeSet Sound, are so profoundly friendly and helpful, I think I would buy something in their store even if I were tone deaf! However, I have actually been playing the guitar for decades and am proud to say that the first guitar I have purchased since moving to Philly two years ago, was from BridgeSet Sound. I bought a limited edition G&L Telecaster ASAT Junior II with a korina top and a pau ferro fret board which Steve kindly pulled from the back after I randomly came upon BridgeSet on my way to another destination. I fell in love with the instrument immediately and consider it one of my main axes. To ice the cake, they gave me a phenomenal deal on the guitar! I do not hesitate to give this shop the business of my musical needs. I have since walked out with some killer effects pedals, electric cables, as well as some very cool percussion effects. BridgeSet also features lessons and a recording studio, in addition to a Ukulele selection that is second-to-none. Even if you are a musical novice, or in search of a gift for a musical friend, Steve & Thao exhibit such patience and accommodation, you are bound to feel perfectly at home in this gem-of-a-musical-instrument-shop!

You get a baby beer and a full sized beer... you get to pet a horse... you look at stuff and smell a piece of wood that has no smell and you listen to cute jokes that are kinda bad but good. You get to see big brewing equipment. If you are me you go when it is cold but it is a lot of time outside so that is kinda bad - bring a coat for sure. or if it is hot wear mostly nothing.  If you are me then there was this lady in a purple 80's jacket that would not stop petting the cyldesdale! and we are all crowded around like in an informal crowd but waiting to pet the horse. Petty, petty, petty. She would would not back away. Because this lady crowded the horse I could not pet the horse even for one second cause then we were herded outside again cause the tours leave every 15 minutes and I didn't want to delay. Several people could not pet the horse. If I could give petting the horse a star rating it would be 5 stars I think. If I was rating this lady it would be only 1 star! But hey that horse made that lady so happy. So it was a win anyway.... I don't think petting a horse's head would have made me as happy as it did her. Oh well.   Beer!

One is the lack of entrances; there are not nearly enough of them for a venue of this magnitude. The lack of entrances mean longer lines to get in and out of the venue. Also the fact that many of the concession booths are cash only. At a concert, I and most others only carry credit cards making it difficult to purchase praline pecans, which are heavenly btw.

I spent a Saturday with my 3 year old daughter and she did NOT want to leave. They've thought of everything.... from the kitchen and supermarket to the hospital and water play.

"This place is a visual treat. Our server was nice and professional and the food was mostly great. Breakfast tacos were fantastic. The eggs Benedict was also really good, but maybe I just had higher expectations of the sauce. It was also under salted. The whipped cream/mascarpone on top of the pancakes was incredible, but the pancakes themselves seemed really thick and heavy. On the upside, the cappuccino and latte set a good standard; I definitely recommend either.  Overall, I would suggest this place if you want to impress the in-laws/out of town friends or celebrate a special occasion. Otherwise, I can't see making it a regular spot due to its prices (it's breakfast/brunch food guys, not caviar and wagyu).",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Hands down my favorite burger place! I have been to both Bru Burgers, however prefer this one due to the better location. For dinner, there is almost always a long wait, but definitely think it's worth it. I always want to eat so much here but I have to really hold myself back. The fries with chili on top are SOOO good, but very filling. I can only order this if I am NOT planning on getting dessert, which is rare. My favorite burger is the Mexicali. It has great flavor and is for sure a winner. But everything else aside, my favorite thing at the Bru Burger is the bread pudding. IT IS SO GOOD! White chocolate peach with ice cream a la mode..it doesn't get much better than than.

So I called to cancel literally 6 hours later-almost a week before we were supposed to stay there and they would NOT refund their money. Booking.com said that this hotel refused to refund bcz there were restrictions. SERIOUSLY?!!  My daughter who booked it and paid for it was 16!!! WILL NEVER GO TO THIS HOTEL! The 'front desk manager', Victor was rude, unwilling to help my kids get their $ back and would not give me the name of his manager. So heartless and unprofessional.

"OMG!!!! I love it, I love it, I love it!  The chef-owner is a total hottie (but he IS married and has a brand new baby girl.) and man can he throw down!  This re-vamped BYO in Northern liberties (bring a nice RED!) served a mean duck breast with fraggola and a tasty Lobster Udon app scented with vanilla butter.  Sooooooo yummy.  We loved our 4 separate  meals here.  Only 1 bad thing - (and I almost downgraded to 4 stars). - once when we came with another couple (and ordered many things) they charged us for splitting an appetizer.  (We did not split any entrees - we ordered 2 apps and 4 entrees).  When we objected they removed it from the bill - but it just seemed cheesy to charge $5.00 to split an app.  (The split-plated it for us - but we did not request that and would have happily picked off each others plates).  Also, the desserts are kind of a downer.  (Only2 or 3 to chosse from and no pastry chef on site.)  Save room and head to Capogiro for dessert!  But you gotta try that duck breast.

"My only regret about my dining experience on Friday afternoon was that I chose to eat inside instead of on the verandah.  Since it was a bit humid out, my friend and I opted to eat inside and the banquette area near the bar was glacial.  Way too cold to sit comfortably.  Fortunately, our server Lisa fixed us up with some hot tea right away, and it was a 5 star experience from then on.  We started with a delicious crab and artichoke flatbread...the perfect combination of flavors.  Lisa was also fully aware that we were in no hurry, so she let us enjoy our appetizer before taking our entree order.  There's nothing worse than dining out and having a ton of food arrive at once.  By the time my perfectly seared scallops arrived, I was more than ready to dive in.  The corn, mushroom, and pea sides complemented the dish as the perfect summer lunch.  My friend had the crab sliders and side salad which were loaded with crab and perfectly seasoned.  We finished with coffee and a good sized portion of strawberry rhubarb pie.  The gelato and strawberry shot(?) were delicious and made for a beautiful presentation.  Our every need was attended to and we enjoyed a nice time catching up.  We will definitely be back to visit.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"This is the third time we have dined at Thomas'.  The first time we had an excellent experience - service, food, ambiance. The second time (about 3 months ago), we had a less than stellar experience.  Third time was the charm.  We went with another couple on February 13.  The restaurant called me and asked us to come in 30 minutes later than our scheduled reservation - no problem.  It is a BYOB and our waiter promptly came to open our wines.  We waited about 20 minutes and when he finally came to take our order, we said we wanted to place our appetizer order and order our entrees when the appetizers arrived.  He went on to tell us that because of a new company policy, that was not possible.  We had to order appetizers and entrees together.  So we ordered everything at once, waited almost an hour, and you guessed it!  Appetizers arrived, 10 minutes later our salads arrived, and 10 minutes later our entrees arrived. We will not be returning anytime soon - just too many outstanding Italian restaurants in South Jersey.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"It's hard to know where to start on this review because our experience went from bad to worse.  I don't ever go to Nacho Mama's expecting five star cuisine - in fact, I am mainly there for the queso dip.  However, two weeks ago my husband and I went to Elmwood and had what may have been the best fish taco I've ever had and I was craving one, but trying to stay local.  Hence our visit to Magazine.  I ordered a 'rita; my husband a mojito.  They had to ""find"" some mint -  which it looked like they might have found in a pond.  Lots of slimy black floaties.  I returned that drink to the bar and trade it in on a 'rita.  Stuff happens, right?  Okay... We order our meals.  Fish tacos for the adults and a steak taco for our daughter.  Oh, and the aforementioned queso.  Chips and queso arrive after a reminder to our waitress.  The chips are greasy.  But I'm hungry, so I let it go.  Well, until I notice that the chip in my hand is greasy and *hairy*.  Sweet baby king cake Jesus.  Having waited tables, I can overlook a lot, but hair in food is a non-negotiable for me.  But I did instinctively flick it away and threw the offending chip to the floor.  I then removed the chips from play.  About that same time, our food arrived.  Have I mentioned we'd been there quite awhile?  Anyway, the tacos come wrapped in paper.  Oh good!  Yummy fish tacos at long last!  I unwrap mine and it's a) warmer than ice cold but colder than room temperature.  It's a temperature that cannot be blamed on the waitstaff.  This is simply a preparation issue.  My husband's are cold and so is my daughter's steak taco.  To their credit, although the rice was also stone cold, the black beans were nuclear hot.  And probably nuked, come to think of it.  Oh, and did I mention that my fish taco is some putrid pink/brown color.  Like Fancy Feast, but now with capers!  I should also mention that at this point I have forbidden everyone at the table from eating *anything* else.  But our waitperson is now MIA.  So I have to enlist another staffer to get the manager.  I do have to say that the manager handled everything well-  comped everything and offered to buy us dinner, but at that point...well, it's going to be awhile before I am ready to venture in again.  We ended up down Magazine at Rum House (which also seemed to be having an off night, but not so off as to risk people's health and well-being).",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I ordered two pairs of glasses and prescription sunglasses in February. The appointment was very long and included police tasering someone in the parking lot. Through all the chaos they never measured the fit. Sunglasses came back wrong size and wrong color lens. No one ever called to say glasses were in. Replacement glasses never came in. Went back three times and had the ""wrong pair"" adjusted while they kept reordering the correct lenses. No one ever called . Called back and were told they were in. The glasses still didn't fit so they suggested I use my warranty and get a totally new brand and pair. I did. No one called to say they came in. Finally I called and they said they were in. Came to get them and lab messed up and only half the lens was colored! Had to reorder again! Just called to check on them and they told me new lens for old pair came in! I asked why when they should be a new lens and frame.... Back to reordering them. It's several months later and I still don't have my sunglasses!  UPDATE: I was told my glasses would have been in by this past Friday. They again were not in. I had an AB person reach out to me here on Yelp and ask for my email so management could get in touch with me. No one has reached out. I have decided to file a complaint with the BBB.  UPDATE: after being told they were overnighted to STL Wednesday they have not arrived. I was told this afternoon that were in fact not fixed in Chesterfield where they said but are now currently in St Cloud Minnesota. No idea when they will arrive. Supposed to call me with tracking later today. Megan did say they will give a full refund. I will post updates again when I get them .   UPDATE: my glasses again did not arrive yesterday as Angie promised .  I called today Tuesday evening. She at first said they were not in and could not update me. I told her I needed an update as she personally promised me the over night delivery to and from facilities that would have been done by last Friday. She said my glasses were done in MN at 7 am yesterday and should have been overnighted to them but had not yet. She said when she gets then she will ship them to me. I said no I will pick them up to inspect as they have been wrong the previous four times. An AB rep from Yelp emailed to say the District Manager would contact me. Still waiting on that call. UPDATE: the DM called me today. It sounds like he is going to fix the issue. I am looking forward to meeting him on Saturday to get a resolution . UPDATE: I met with Kyle the DM.

"This place has so much potential. I love the atmosphere and the staff is always friendly. However, their menu is not impressive. My office is within walking distance of FDR and we have given them multiple chances to impress us. Their prices are too high (especially for lunch) and their food leaves us wanting more. Many of their meals don't come with sides. Be prepared to drop $6 for one or walk away hungry from your meal. They also have very few vegetarian options.   If they could improve their menu, speed, and create more reasonable lunch prices, I think people would frequent this place more often.

I trekked out from University City to Northern Liberties in hopes for a short line. Alas, it was still quite long and let me tell you..the wait was worth it. Their Creme Brulee French Toast was an amazing balance of sweetness but not being too overly sweet. My friend got the Kitchen Sink, which was an eclectic mixture of everything you could possibly stuff into an omelette and still make it delicious.   Overall, I was extremely happy (and pleasantly full) with my meal!

It's gigantic but more importantly it's delicious every time you order it.I've had it at least 10 times. However, the lasagne was disgusting.  The meat was odd and there was one lasagna noodle with a mountain of mozzarella cheese on top.  It was a joke.  The service used to be excellent.  They are so busy there has been a predicable drop off on quality.  However, I went there with a friend and she ordered fish well done.  When her fish came back she asked to have it cooked a little more. The waiter refused saying ""our cook will not cook it anymore.""  I asked him what that means and he just shrugged.  The person i was with told me to forget about it but I knew she was dissatisfied and I was swallowing my own anger.  Why couldn't they just stick the fish in a  pan for a few minutes longer?

My husband went to pick-up the order after the specified amount of time had passed and pick-up took longer than expected.

I then asked if there were any specials, he then, awkwardly told us about them. The cheese plate comes. He plops it down and begins to walk away- I ask him for a description of said cheeses, and he hems and haws and tells my wife and I what a long day he's had. Fried green tomatoes. Microwaved breaded crap. $27 short ribs, to say the portion was small would be an embarrassment to the word small. Needless to say, we opted out of dessert (our waiter never mentioned a dessert menu, just if we wanted our check). Fine. It's now 10pm and decide to have a drink at the bar. Great. The bar is taken over by what appeared to be the kitchen staff and catering staff (from upstairs) Drunk, loud, and bellicose- our bartender, after making me one drink- leaves behind the bar to put her face into her phone texting at one of the bar tables.

I must admit the juice was extraodinary! I was expecting a bitter vegetable juice considering they put a lot of kale in it but I was pleasantly surprised as the juice had vegetable tones but tasted like a fruit juice without the feeling of consuming entirely too much sugar (Which I probably was). The burrito was tasty but not something I'll remember, it was simple and filled my belly. I mean how hard is it to screw up eggs pico de gallo and spinach? I could probably make the burrito at home so I won't be coming back here for burritos, however I do crave fresh juice from time to time so I'll definitely be back for some juice!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I can't say enough good things about this place!  This is the downtown location, and as such it gets pretty packed and ""touristy"" at peak times, which is the only downside, but once you eat here it's easy to understand what all the fuss is about.    The BBQ is the best in town, hands down.  The beer garden upstairs is a great place to grab a drink and kill time downtown - they really did it right here.  In addition to great food and drinks, the staff is always very friendly and the wait times are quite reasonable considering the crowds.  You can tell they're busting their tails.    We live near the original location, so we prefer to go there on most occasions, as it's not as crowded.  But when we have guests or find ourselves downtown, this location is quite a bit larger and more fun - it's a can't miss stop if you're in the area.    I typically get the brisket burger with a side of Mac-n-Cheese, and then put half the Mac-n-Cheese on the burger to make it a Mac-N-Cheese Brisket Burger, which is beyond good.  That said, if you take one thing away from this review...GET THE MAC AND CHEESE!  You won't be sorry.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

A couple years ago I had a friend visit from London and she really wanted a Gritty cake for her 50.  I called Maryanne's and asked if they could help me out, placed the order on the phone, explained who Gritty was and was told the baker/decorator would make it look great even though they hadn't made one before.

"This place is really fun. I take people here typically when they've never been to Idaho, because you know... potato's, French fries, it's all very idaho. Fries and fry sauces & seasonings are deelish! Burgers are kind of bland. I feel like they used to be better. The past 4 times we've gone, the burger patty is really dry, and thin. It's a little pricy for a decent burger and great fries and fun atmosphere. But... I'd still encourage someone to try it at least once.

"The pizza was good!  Everything else, subpar.    Had the calamari, a Caesar salad, and a medium meat lovers pizza.  The calamari was greezy and completely flavorless.  The salad was fresh, but the Parmesan cheese they use is terrible!  I'm pretty sure it's the Parmesan cheese you find pre-grated in the shaker, with no expiration date.  The pizza was actually pretty delicious.  All the toppings seemed fresh, and the crust was crispy.  I'll go back for the pizza.  Also, I heard good things about the fried ravioli while I was there, so I'll have to try that out next time.  The service was a miss for us.  It wasn't the worst service I ever had.  She was friendly, just didn't really check on us.  Took the order, brought the food, and brought the check.  No one greeted us as we walked in the door, & I wasn't sure how everything worked.  We sat down at a table, but after a while, I had to go get my own menu from the counter.  I hope the fountain drinks are self serve, because that's what we did.  The dining area looks like a pizza joint from the early 80s.  It could use a good cleaning, and possibly an overhaul.  The price is hard to beat.  They have an extensive menu.  Overall, it's not bad.  I'll definitely try it again, and if the fried ravioli lives up to the hype, I may up the star rating.  As of right now, I give it 3.5 stars.  Tonight, it just wasn't at the four star level.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

We were a bit hesitant seeing all the kid birthday parties however, there's such a vast selection of pottery pieces from cups, vases, jewelry holders, Christmas trees, ornaments and so much more. This is a great place for friends to gather and a date night option. The only take walk ins or reservations for groups of 7+ people. You pay a studio fee of $8 to get access to the brushes, paint, stencils and supplies. In additional, you pay for pottery which ranges from $10 to $40. It took us two hours to paint and we will definitely be back. You will leave your finished piece to be fired and glazed and can pick up in a week.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 5.0

"After getting numerous recommendations and seeing this 4.5 start rated place come up on my Yelp app every time I search for a place near my apartment, I finally made it in for a visit. It was about 8:30 on a Tuesday night and the open sign was lit up in the window, although all the chairs were already turned upside down and placed on the tables and nobody could be seen working inside. There wasn't a sign with opening and closing times on the door, so we checked it out and luckily the door was unlocked. My first impression was similar to a lot of the other reviews in that this is probably not the best place to choose if you are looking for some ambiance. There is definitely some room for improvement when it comes to tidying up the inside a bit, but there was at least some fun Greek music playing and it was much better than some of the reviews make it sound.  Ordering is done at the counter, where we were greeted by who I assume was Adel, and also the nicest owner of a restaurant I might have ever met. He was all smiles and welcomed us in to his place. Either he is the world's best liar, or he genuinely was delighted to have us in and was excited to get to serve us what he had to offer, and my money is on the latter. The menu isn't extensive, but has all of the Greek favorites. I ended up with the gyro ($7) and a piece of baklava ($2). The gyro was enormous, and with a second pita would easily make 2 good sized gyros. I found it actually impossibly to pick up the pita and eat it without first just eating some of the meat by itself. It comes topped with onions and has lettuce, tomato slices, and tzatziki sauce on the side. The gyro meat was served hot, and was even less greasy than some that I have gotten from other places. The pita was soft and delicious, and it was put in an oven before serving so it was warm. While waiting on our food to get prepared, Adel was super friendly and asked about where I went to school and what I did for a living and talked about his kids and made actual great conversation, which isn't all that easy to come by while waiting on a to go order at most places. I didn't manage to dig into the baklava until the next morning because I was too full from the gyro, but it was still good after sitting in a refrigerator all night and made for an easier time convincing myself if was ok to eat dessert for breakfast than most sweets.  All in all, I think this place delivers more than what you pay for. You're not going to get the décor of some of the nicer Greek places in town, but for the fantastic friendly service and enormous amount of good food for under $10, this place is hard to criticize in any way. I'll definitely be back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Candlewood Suites is part of IHG which operates several hotel chains that includes Holiday Inn (Express) and that they are pet friendly this was (is) important because I would be traveling with Vino and prefer to have him with me than in a kennel.   After an extremely long and exhausting drive walked in and found that they still had availability for the posted rate and we quickly got started.  The keys to room # 121 were given and quickly noticed that there is a noise issue. This room sits across the hall from the service counter so you will hear conversations quite clearly, the  attendants carts going up and down the hall is annoying and children very excited to go to the pool can be heard through the door all too well.  The only reason I would recommend this room is if you were hard of hearing or are a serious creeper that wants to know what is going on all of the time while looking through your peephole ? After an hour of this brought it to clerks attention and they offered to move me to another floor the next two nights were in # 322 on the third floor which was very quiet.   Fine print :  * Use a credit card when checking in. If you use a debit they will put hold on your account that could take up to 10 days to release. * There is a pet charge, this is not listed on the corporate web page it simply states that they are ""pet friendly"".  * The fee is $15.00 for the first night and $10.00 for each additional night not to exceed $150.00 per stay. You will be asked to fill out a ""care card"" should there be any problems or in the worst case scenario the vet needs to be called.    What will you get for your dollar here -  * The room is large enough that two people wouldn't be stepping on one another. * The kitchen has a full size microwave, refrigerator and dishwasher. * If you are in need of a stove top there are two flat top burners that work on a timer as not to burn the place down.  * Other amenities, two big gas grills are available and the front desk will even loan you the spatulas and tongs ya might need for your cookout.  * Did you forgot to pack a blender or crockpot you may borrow one along with a movie.  *  A gym is available as well as an office center.

I am going to sound like an old fogie here (to be clear, I'm mid-20s) but the store seems to be more focused on employees' abundance of mac-themed tattoos and affinity for kitschy accessories than on said employees' actual professionalism and politeness. They are good-natured and nice enough, but when I went today no fewer than two times did an employee interrupt me in the middle of a sentence to ask my salesperson a question (guess it can't wait huh?). I also was referred to with a point and a ""her over there.""  I just dropped he equivalent of two days' pay at your store. I expect to be treated with at least an average amount of respect. For the record, the lady helping me was nice.

"Located in the heart of Santa Barbara, this store has a lot of potential for doing well.  It's surrounded by a great array of shopping choices, sure to attract potential customers.  When you walk inside, it's clean (though smells a bit *too* much like nail polish, comparatively speaking) and on first glance everything looks pretty nice.  However, my girl friends got both manicures and pedicures, and the job seemed really rushed.  While waiting, I stopped into the bathroom to find it very dirty (making me wonder how sanitary the rest of the place really was), with a mop and bucket hanging against the doorway, and foil wrapped loosely around the pipes (does that fix leaks now?).  The nail jobs themselves weren't all that great - the filing was lopsided on more than a couple of the nails, and the polish wasn't even across the surface.  They even missed some spots close to the skin, leaving the nail bare.  Within 24 hours, some of the polish had started to come off, and within a week most of it was gone, to the point that my friends just had to use remover and go with bare nails instead.  I hope this place can turn itself around, but it just doesn't seem like they're really putting in the effort where it counts.  Spend some more quality time with your customers, make sure you're doing a good job, and put some extra money into your supplies.

I had been sent to a really seriously deplorable medical supply company- Apria, who had me stuck at home, in my bed- taking their time getting me a walker so I could finally move around again- FOR MONTHS  I was left like this. With Lincare I had requested someone, anyone other than Apria- I was directed to lincare. The same day the oxygen was ordered I was called within the hour to see if I'd be home later the same day. I told them the hours I'd expected to be home- which wasn't very long- the company is based in Reno, I live in a Truckee, 40 mins later here I am meeting the driver outside!! I couldn't believe it! She had great advice little tips and assurances that if I ever encountered a situation in which I required o2 STAT, they could accommodate.

"This hotel is bad, borderline mediocre. Of course, the hotel remains in construction which is an inconvenience, but manageable. The front desk is located on the tenth floor which makes it difficult to get help quickly. Room floors are inaccessible without a room key in the elevator. This wouldn't be an issue had the keys actually worked half the time (we had to get 5 new room keys). The elevators come once per hour and are almost always full, so you might as well get some exercise and take the stairs. The pool seemed too vacant (probably because the ""front"" desk was right in front of it). The rooms were quaint as they served their purpose, a place to sleep. Definitely not luxurious, but towels/soap were always cleaned and replaced. Our AC unit was faulty and we had to call for the hotel engineers to be fixed, but it remained operational after. Overall, horrible service and facility, but the rooms themselves are adequate. Location's great, in the heart of the French Quarter. I'd only suggest staying here to save some money to spend on the delicious restaurants.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 2.0

"The food was amazing, and the service was superb. Jade  was our server and was so kind, personable, and attentive.   We started with the tuna tartare and farmers platter. We got the 7 item farmers platter (3 meats and 4 cheeses) and it was delicious, but not enough for our group of 7, so we ended up ordering a second one. My sister got the sangria and said it was okay. I had the lilac & tonic which was very delicious!   The kids had the cheese pizza and loved it! Four of us got the steak frites, two of us had the house béarnaise sauce and two had the chimichurri sauce. I tried the house béarnaise and it was tasty, but the chimichurri was amazing! We got the truffle fries to go with it and they were delicious! My sister got the steak sandwich and she enjoyed it very much.   For dessert we had the mango sorbet, salted caramel gelato, chocolate torte cake, and cheesecake (minus the strawberry topping). I tried all except the cheesecake and they were delicious!! The chocolate tort cake did come with a scoop of mascarpone cheese on top, which we did not realize, and the kids definitely were surprised at the taste!   As some other reviews said it was very loud in there, and I would definitely agree. The sound just echoed and with the restaurant being full, it just magnified a lot and mad it hard to even hear the person you were sitting next to.

"We got a plate of a dozen of raw oysters. An amazing experience.  An experience was nothing I have ever got close to in any of the 'proper' 'sea food' restaurants.  The guy operates right on the street: takes oysters from the table and splits them into two parts with a knife right in front of you. Once he got enough of those prepared, he puts them into a large plate to gives to the next customer. Once in a while he brings a basket of new oysters to refill the supplies.  The guy brings a lot of fun to the process and is extremely positive and conversational. Tells a lot of stories and makes a lot of jokes (friendly ones). Was fun just be around while waiting for our turn.  If you like oysters and would like to try the real stuff -- check it out.  Be prepared to: * wait some time as the line might be quite long and you don't see it * you might just chill out somewhere nearly or go for a drink in the meanwhile if waiting  takes too long -- there is a lot of places around.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"My hubby & I had lunch here yesterday in search of a really good beef dip, that's his favourite. We stumbled upon it after trying Rockin Robins earlier in the week located in the same plaza.  The decor dates back to the original 1976 opening as it states but it is charming. Full of half moon black booths & parquet table tops. The service was great, the ladies were very attentive & frequented our table often keeping the pop topped upped. We got there at 11:30 & there were already a few tables. By the time we left an hour later the place was packed with people on their work lunch breaks. The place is not overly huge but not to small either.  We both ordered the beef dip, he had fries, I had caesar salad. When the beef dip arrived visually we were both disappointed with the size of the sandwich. It is served on a sesame sub bun which is fairly small as beef dips go. The fries could have been a healthier serving as well & the salad was overflowing. After our first bites the sandwich had made up for its size in taste. The bun was toasted with garlic butter & the beef was sliced, almost shaved, moist & oh so tasty. The fries were absolutely delicious & I'm not a huge fry enthusiast . The Caesar salad was fine, powdered Parmesan & boxed croutons , tasty enough.   Verdict. We would definitely go back for the beef dip. We would also really like to try the philly cheese steak with its good reviews as well. Oh, & the bathroom was clean yet tiny.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

The fried rice was solid, nothing special.    The egg roll was delicious, fresh and crispy....as close to perfect as you can get!

"Visiting New Orleans and just had the most incredible meal at Domenica at the Roosevelt Hotel.    Started with Vellutata Di Fungi Soup and the Arugula Salad.  Ordered the small portions on both and was just enough.  If you love mushrooms, I recommend you try the Vellutata.    For my entree, my waiter Alex  suggested the Brasato Al Barolo and I am extremely pleased with the selection.  The beef was prepared to perfection and the celery was a surprising flavor that enhanced the meal.    I finished off the experience with coffee and the Torta Di Bergamo.  This wonderful desert consisted of a rum soaked cake layered with chocolate mousse & apricot marmellata.  A delightful end to a complete meal.    I do recommend that you make reservations for this restaurant as they can be busy, but that is because the food is spectacular.  I cannot wait to come back to NOLA and try other options on the menu.

"I've been going to Kay's nails on Crystal Lake Ave, Haddonfield for years now. They have always done an excellent job and are always very clean. Although, lately I have not been that happy with my services. I am a regular mani/pedi customer, I do not see a particular provider but I have to say the last 3 times I have been there (with 3 different providers)I have gotten mediocre service. The foot massages have been lacking almost to the point of non-existent. At my most recent visit the provider massaged one foot but just put lotion on the other no massaging and she completely forgot to give me a hand massage during my pedicure. I am writing this review because I do like going there but if this continues I will be finding a new place for my services. I am still giving 4 stars because they are nice people and it is a clean environment. I am hoping this review helps the owners to give their girls a pep-talk about giving longer, better foot massages.

They make food there too, up front. I haven't had it, but I see people munching, everybody seems happy. They have seven TVs in there, sports, etc. Good lay-out to the place, big but cozy. Good-looking crowd, karaoke on Thursdays, just a fun relaxed neighborhood place. I love the lights they have in there, adds a fun surprising element and otherworldliness. Black lights, and sometimes colored lights that make designs on the walls, and twinkling lights that move across the bar. I'm into it.

Of course the biggest deterrent for me is that they allow smoking inside, and smokers love it at 3 Crow. I'd say around 75% of the bar patrons are smoking (if not more), so just be prepared for that.   They also have a patio outside that I discovered over the weekend (nice!).

I proceeded to move this to the side of the bar.  When the waitress brought us a new one, she grabbed the one I just removed and brought it over... baffled when I explained what she had just done.  She couldn't understand how that was not acceptable.  Moving on...  I ordered the petite filet special.  To my surprise, it was a petite, petite filet.  Pounded out to a 1/2"" thick and pan fried.  Don't get me wrong, but tell me it will be pan fried and call it a ""pan fried steak"" !  To top that, it was served with potato chips.  YES... potato chips.

"Sometimes things just don't work out.  We've been trying to get to Red Pavilion for more than a year and last night it felt like the stars were aligned.  It was a busy Wednesday night but we were seated promptly and thr hot tea was very promising but alas it went all down hill from there. Our server was new but cheerful and enthusiastic but somewhere during the order processing and the delivery of our meal things fell apart.  My wife ordered a combo and I ordered a Tofu dish. I needed to know if there were any animal or milk products in my dish. Our sever checked and gave us the okay.  We also ordered an appetizer of spring rolls where also deemed vegan safe.  After that there was a considered about of time that went by. Two other tables, a two top, who seemed to be regular customers were attended to very quickly and received their soup and salad very quickly. The four top had already several dishes delivered. Their last dish, a sizzling plate of meat arrived and the folks in Kuna could have heard it.  We received a salad bowl of Wonton chips and Sweet and Sour sauce.  Neither bowl or ramekin matched the restaurants decor and looked like 'emergency dishes' to placate diners who were waiting.  While I appreciate the effort, it was never explained why we received the chips or why there was a delay for our order. Our spring rolls arrived and they were hot and moments later my Tofu bowl arrived.  The picture is attached. I am not sure what to call this. It had massive amounts of Tofu and seemed like a soup. I did ask for it to be spicy but it was not spicy.  The worst part was that my Tofu dish was barely warm and in some parts of the bowl, it was cold. My brown rice didn't look fresh. My wife's combo plate was severely lacking and it was barely warm.  We did have to ask for silverware and we trudged through our dinner feeling underwhelmed.  We didn't take anything home and paid the $40 dollar bill and left.    I don't know what happened but I have two working hypotheses.   1. The customization of my dish to be vegan was not welcomed in the kitchen and we were instantly known as 'those people'    2. We stood out since we were not regular customers and the regular customers received preferential treatment.   I don't know and rather don't care at this point what was the reason, we felt like we were not welcomed and we'll choose to go elsewhere for $40.   I want to be clear that my wife and I have over 70 years of restaurant experience between the both of us and most of that was in leadership roles so when we know, we know.   I wish Red Pavilion all the best in the community just don't expect my wife and I to be back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

We were craving Thai food but we wanted to try something new instead of her usual go-tos so we yelped some options and this one came up. Based on the pictures the food looked really well spiced just like what I feel I really enjoy. We came here on a Friday night and it was semi busy.. We decided to get the pate with vegetables, a menu special which was a curry flights, and another special of ground basil Thai with a fried egg. First the ground basil chicken came out and it was so nicely flavored and the chicken cooked so well you didn't even need to eat the rice with it -- The egg was a nice addition as well. Then the pate came out with vegetables and that was flavored really well and noodles cooked perfectly. Finally the curry flight came out and one of the best Thai dishes I've eaten. It came with red curry, green curry, Penang curry, Massaman with roti and some vermicelli noodles. I can usually never pick which curry I want but I loved how I got all four. They were all flavors so well and it was distinctly different and you could tell which one is which. I can't wait to come back to this place and try more of their delicious items.

"My wife and I were so pleased with the services Sidney, Jessica, and the SBB Gourmet Catering team provided for our wedding at the Santa Barbara Historical Museum recently. Their knowledge of the museum and ability to suggest best options according to the specifications of the venue made it much easier on us to make decisions throughout the process. Jessica went with us to the venue for our walkthroughs and worked closely with our wedding planner to determine everything that was needed as far as rentals were concerned. Sidney and Jessica were so nice from start to finish, and were also very accommodating. We made a couple of changes to the menu and were a little indecisive at times, and they were very patient and helped us through those moments. They were very respectful of the property and, as a result, we received our full security deposit back from the venue.   As far as the food goes, it was delicious. Our guests loved everything, including the service from the servers. Before the event, I was worried that since we got buffet style that some of the food may not be as good of quality as when we tasted it in smaller servings. However, every bite (chicken, steak, grilled veggies, potatoes) was just as good as when we tasted them the first time. The hors d'oeuvres were a HIT. Our guest could not get enough.

"I love this Vietnamese fast casual restaurant! I had the opportunity to check it out in the most non-assuming way and I am glad I did! A new co-worker suggested Vietnamese for lunch at her ""welcome to the company"" luncheon and we mapped the closest places and this brought us to DD Mau. This will now be my new lunch spot 100%! The price point is excellent and for fresh different healthy options I am all in.  I ordered the chicken vermicelli bowl and it comes with a fried spring roll which is delish. The vermicelli bowl was beautiful, delicious and filling. I love the fact they have different sauce options so you could easily change up your meal just by using a different sauce. I ask had the chicken spring rolls with peanut sauce which was good. I enjoyed the food and ambiance so much that I didn't hold the fact I received the WRONG order considering I ordered the chicken bao sliders and NOT the spring rolls. The only reason is the fact someone else at my table ordered the bao and since both items came in a pack of two we shared and each of us tried a bao slider and a spring roll.  The girl in the register did not seem very comfortable so I assumed she was not used to being in the front of the house. Others I my party mentioned her ""awkwardness"" when ordering, which is my only negative comment.   Someone in my party had the fried rice and I had to do a double take- it looked like ""hood"" fried rice!!! Trust me, this is an EXCELLENT thing! Rich deep brown rice with onions and meat- none of this light colored peas and carrots rice! I now have an excuse to come back sometime this week just for the fried rice!   They have Thai iced tea and Vietnamese coffee (with the condensed milk) which I was tempted to try but I didn't. However it looked good.   Also just a side note I LOVE their disposables! The clear containers for bao and spring rolls look clean and contemporary and their white plastic bowls with lids also look contemporary and chic. I ate all my food but REFUSED to throw out that cute bowl and will wash it and use it for my brown bag lunch days at work.   Julie was the sweetest and asked how our food was and followed up! All of the workers here with the exception of the cashier was sweet and friendly and so vested in you having a great experience, another reason why I see myself making this a weekly lunch stop.

"Oh boy. Where to start?   I cannot recall giving one star in such a very long time. Actually, I looked -- the last time I gave an establishment one star was in June 2011. More than two years ago!  Sadly, this place deserves the single star.   When I walked into the place, I found that it was nearly empty. Strange, on a Sunday late afternoon that only two parties would be seated. Perhaps this should have served as a red flag? I had read other Yelp reviews on this place which were hugely mixed. I decided to stay and give it a go.   The restaurant is very spacious -- plenty of room for large parties of people. I imagined that the restaurant would get packed at times, full of families. Also, I found that the staff was very highly attentive and accommodating. I immediately had a good feeling; believing that if the service is this wonderful, the food must be something amazing.   Wrong, wrong, wrong.   Sad to say that no matter how wonderful the service, this place could never gain more than one star.   Earlier reviewers were right on -- the food is served at the wrong temperature: too-too cold or lukewarm. What a disappointment, and I was out of $10. Nothing like biting into fresh-looking piece of broccoli and finding that it was below the temperature of lukewarm; that weird phase between cold and warm. Ugh.   My method with all buffets is to take one bite-sized serving of as many things as possible. Bite-sized as in one jab of a fork or swoop of the chopsticks. This way, I can try many dishes without getting too overwhelmed at once. Also, it enables me to bypass those things that I find I do not like without wasting any food at all.   So here goes:  The salmon nigiri was too soft and flavorless.  The crab puffs were extremely sweet, like sugary sweet.  The mushrooms looked delicious but were overcooked.  The tofu skin (sushi) was actually quite nice. Very nice flavor. This was my favorite bite.  The batter on the sesame chicken had turned soggy.   The rice on the crab topped sushi roll had turned into a mold of itself.  The BBQ ribs were cold.   I observed a few other things: the restaurant serves fresh oysters, but they were submerged in a container of ice water; the desserts were plentiful, but did not look fresh; the sushi was nearly nonexistent; I saw a slice of a brown banana mixed in with fresh slices.   But it was the rice that did me in. Rice is the grand staple of any Asian-style restaurant. Here, the rice was served alongside other dishes in the buffet line. The container was wrapped in what appeared to be some form of plastic wrap, leaving the rice -- uncovered. The rice was so horribly dried out that I almost complained to the server. But, alas, considering the quality of the rest of the food I really didn't see the point in complaining about anything whatsoever.   All told, I was at the restaurant for less than 30 minutes.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

Music was good. Food was fair. I had a chicken Cobb salad. The chicken was bland. It needed more seasoning. The other couple shared the teriyaki chicken wings. They said they were tasty but smothered in sauce. The fish and chips were also only fair. The chips came out ice cold and undercooked. They did make new fries which were hot but a little on the hard side. Cole slaw was inedible.,Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 2.0
"Torn between two and three stars. Jalapeño crab poppers could easily have been from Costco, they are too uniform and unappealing to be house made and they tasted fishy without a hint of jalapeño heat.

"Got a chance eat here today. We split the crunchy and pipping hot fried green tomatoes. Fried chicken was delicious crispy and spicy and totally worth all the anticipation . My husband really enjoyed his mofu as well. Between us we tried the mac n cheese, pickled beets, three beans and the turnip greens ( sigh!!! Sooo good). One of the servers was very friendly and went out of her way to talk to us about the concept, dishes vegetarian friendly choices etc.   I was concerned about parking, but there was a lot of street parking around. There is a public parking lot diagonally opposite to the restaurant.  The ambience was great, including a beautiful mural which has been in that spot for a very long time.  The only problem is that they call out your name when the food is ready and it is sometimes hard to heard over music and conversation. But they just opened and hopefully will get the kinks straightened out soon!

"I stayed at this Marriott for a wedding and had a wonderful time Sept of 2018.  So naturally when I was traveling through Tampa on my anniversary I wanted to stop by and stay again.  Well, online their price was one thing but not honored upon arrival?  I was reluctant to pay extra but I wanted to stay here and experience previous stay.  When I entered the room I was not satisfied for what I was told I would have to pay extra for. The View was blocked by the garage roof.  Management was defiant to rectify another issue with bed size. I had to physically go to the front desk and speak to Mike the Manager on duty.   I actually had to show pics from my phone to get him to even consider adjusting the room price.

"Nasty, nasty stuffy air!!   I have literally taken prison tours with fresher air. The lobby had nice, cool fresh air. Not so the elevators, hallways or our room. Even after cranking down the thermostat to try to pull fresher air through our room-the humidity level was cloyingly high so I think they are not using any fresh air exchangers in the HVAC system. We booked a king room and were given a queen. The room looked out onto... tuh duh... more rooms and a parking area on the rooftop. All this for a ""valued Hyatt member"". They were booked and would not change our room. Basically told to go suck eggs. Have some business calls to make? You'll need to go out onto the very busily trafficked city street to make/maintain calls. We have ATT and its normally very easy to get calls through almost anywhere. We weren't alone. People were wandering the lobby holding their phones out with the ""hello? Hello? Can you hear me?"" not so funny comedy routine happening wherever I looked. And if you try to use the lobby computers... they've blocked out Trivago and many other travel sites as being 'inappropriate'...Inappropriate because you might be trying to book a room elsewhere!  The lobby chairs were worn, stained and just plain gnarly. I'd be grossed out to have those in a halfway house-let alone a Hyatt Place.

"I've been to Ralph three times over the past few years, and I don't think I'll be going back again.  Bottom line: this place is overpriced.  Case in point in the tomato and mozzarella appetizer.  It's $9.75.  I understand that appetizers and desserts are the place to mark-up prices, and that's fine. These people run a business to make money.  However, I cannot respect a restaurant that gouges its customers.  This particular appetizer is one tomato cut up (prob cost them 50 cents), a few small mozzarella balls, and then a drizzle of balsamic vinaigrette.  A dish that costs them $2-$3 to make should not be priced at $9.75.  Similarly, a bottle of beer, Stella, cost $7.  Furthermore, the menu prices on their website are out of date and misleading.  Another case in point: the veal saltimbocca.  On the website, it's listed as $23.  In the restaurant, however, its $25.  This is one of my favorite dishes because of the prosciutto that is traditionally supposed to cover the veal cutlet.  At Ralph's, there were three tiny bites of prosciutto.  I honestly don't think I was even given one full slice, let alone enough to cover the veal.    I think Ralph's offers traditional Italian food in a great atmosphere.  However, in a city like Philadelphia where Italian restaurants are a dime a dozen, Ralph's has to do much more to make it worth your while.  The food isn't bad, but it's not great either.  On top of serving lackluster food, they have the nerve to charge an arm and a leg for it.  I can think of at least two other Italian restaurants in the city where the food is better AND cheaper.  Ralph's is the perfect example of a once-great restaurant that is now resting on its laurels and relying on name only.  Try it out if you must, but don't expect to be wowed.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Our food came up pretty quickly after we ordered. I ordered the Blueberry pancakes. I have them before at other Cracker Barrel's and loved them.  The pancakes came packed full of blueberries and a tiny bottle of blueberry syrup. The blob of a butter like substance on top was weird. Not very buttery tasting.  We also got a bowl of grits some eggs over medium, a couple of biscuits and sausage gravy. We ate everything but the gravy. It just didn't appeal to our tastes. I saw other people lapping it up on their biscuits.  Overall the food was hot and filled us up. Pancakes had a burnt taste so that was a bit disappointing.  Service was great.

"Sunday, May 20, 2012, 7:55 pm - 9:22 pm  Worst service I have seen in over 20 years by an entire restaurant wait staff.   Tonight was the first time in my life that I zeroed out a tip.   After waiting 13 minutes for service, I went to the bar to order two beers.   It took another 7 minutes to get the attention of someone ( even the manager did his best to avoid good paying and cheerful customers).  Two beers were grabbed from the fridge by the bar maid and I was told that would be $9.   I took the beers and had to ask someone else for glasses.   So, 20 minutes into my experience I finally received attention at my table by a ""wait staff member.""   We ordered a simple pair of appetizers.   The food arrived 18 minutes later, but it tasted good and we were really hungry.   Again, unfortunately we didn't see our waitress for a LONG time and gave up on entrees or a second round.  I paid at the bar which seemed to take forever and promised myself to never, ever visit the Creve Coeur Lakehouse again.   My wife who was with me told me that this was a common problem.   It is unfortunate since this former-driving range bar is situated in a beautiful place frequented by lots of people who are enjoying Creve Coeur Lake.   I hope this review gets the attention of the owners (not the managers) so that adjustments may be made.

Ooh La La would not answer my questions because they would have revealed too much to soon.  3) It is NOT funny to make a team think they solved the mystery and get their emotions all high and then pull the rug from under for the sake of a laugh, isn't professional.

"After getting take out here numerous of times, I've finally decided to put in my review.  I found this take out about a year or so ago. It's not easily spotted if you don't already know about it. It's located in a strip mall next to other small stores.   Since my first time here, I've been coming back for more and more.   Environment/Food/Service: Just your typical Chinese take out. They do have 2 tables inside for people to eat in I believe, but I usually only see people taking out. I've came here from week days to weekends. It's slower on the week days, and tends to get busy on weekend nights. The people that work are pretty friendly. Always very welcoming towards me. They don't speak 100% English, but well enough to communicate. Food has always been awesome since the first time I came! I would recommend their general tsos chicken and egg foo young! Their vegetables are usually pretty fresh too. Prices are fair too, they have a lot of combinations and specials on their menu. Definately check those out too. Oh another plus is there coupons! Hello, freebies? Depending on how much you spend you get a free 2 liter or wonton soup or pork fried rice or even their grandfather chicken. (Yummmm)  Overall I really enjoy this little take out.

"WARNING: The medium chicken will have your eyes watering, forehead perspiring, and mouth begging for water.  It's not dunk-your-head-in-a-trough spicy but it's much hotter than you'd expect.  I got the medium level of heat at Hattie B's Hot Chicken in Nashville and there was only a hint of heat.  It was more flavorful than anything.   Southern's medium is indeed hot ass chicken.  My brother got the next heat level up and I couldn't taste a difference.  Maybe my sense of taste had been burned off at that point and that's why I couldn't differentiate them.    Through the inferno I could tell the chicken itself was great.  Juicy, crispy, plump(plump!).  So I went back and got the original which has no spice and it was fantastic!  As soon as it reached the table it was gone.  It was likely pretty disturbing to watch me eat it.  I probably should be fed fried chicken like the raptors are fed that cow in Jurassic Park.  You won't actually see me eat.  You'll just see it lowered into the cage and then the foliage will wildly rustle while I loudly rip it apart. (YouTube search Jurassic Park Raptor Feeding for reference)  Here's my problem with the original...it's damn good but St. Louis has plenty of places to get damn good, artery clogging fried chicken.  I don't know how long I can spend $13.50 on original recipe when Porter's and King Edward's offer the same for about $7-8.    I'll almost certainly go back to Southern.  Mainly because I have a fried chicken addiction.  Plus their mac and cheese might be the best I've ever had.  I'm also hoping they lower the heat on the medium.

"I REALLY want to like this place. The concept of locally sourced and organic food, a creative menu, and repurposed decor stands for everything I find intriguing in a restaurant and feel good about supporting. Unfortunately, it's not executing very well. I think they set up shop in the wrong town, firstly....organic coffee is now off the menu because no one wanted to pay the extra $.20 for it, and so many other original menu items have been rotated out due to lack in popularity that what you see on the menu is most likely not what you're going to get. I order the Cunshy omelette, with mushrooms, caramelized onions and local Gouda. As another reviewer mention, the onions were not at all caramelized...which didn't make it taste bad, but just don't call it that if you aren't delivering....and I noted immediately that my ""Gouda"" had holes in it. I mentioned to our waitress (who was making no special effort to be friendly, but also not UN-friendly, just, whatever...) that my Gouda seemed more like Swiss, and she said, ""oh yeah, we don't have Gouda anymore...Swiss is pretty close to the same thing."" I shook my head. ""no it's not."" Had I known I would've asked for the aged cheddar. Small things, when compiled make a huge thing: SUPER dirty coffee mug, all the way around, no butter or silverware on the table, and no music playing so I can listen to my dining neighbors discuss their taxes. We waited a bit too long for our check for an empty diner, but this place doesnt seem to be winning awards for service. The bus guy was really nice at least.Good news: tastiest hash browns I've had in awhile. These are surprisingly hard to find. Truvia on the table (very expensive stuff). Sourdough bread.

"Gentelin's is THE fine dining option in Alton. We went in last night at around 5. We were able to take advantage of their happy hour on drinks and appetizers (that lasts until 6 during the week).  What I ordered: we ordered the Santa Fe wraps and pork dumplings for appetizers. Both were on the happy hour menu and both were just okay. I think I could get better versions of both dishes other places. For my entree I ordered the goat cheese and pear salad. The goat cheese surprised me. It wasn't directly on the salad, but rather in two fries goat cheese bites that were AMAZING. I think they should just offer the goat cheese bites as an appetizer. One thing that threw me off about the salad- the pear was in big chunks. This isn't a big deal, but I feel like it is normally sliced. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and andouille skewer. He loved it! I would probably give this experience 3 stars if not for the drink I ordered- the mojito. It was perfectly muddled and so refreshing on a hot day! It was $6 which I think is a great price for the drink.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I was the one with the challenge to bring delight to Susan J., the 'hard to wow' customer...who just wrote a 5-star review. I have to say that from my side, Victoria was an absolute pleasure to work with...and I have very high standards when it comes to responsiveness and personalized service. When I called Victoria and said I had a challenging assignment for her...and if she was up to the challenge of wowing a Paris-trained floral designer...she responded with an enthusiastic and unqualified ""Yes."" She asked how much I wanted to spend and I asked her how much she needed to 'wow.'  She gave me a range and I picked the high end.  Well, not only did she achieve the 'wow' but she responded to follow-up emails within 15 minutes max and even had her driver follow the order to the front desk of the small Inn where Susan was spending a mother-daughter weekend for her birthday. Thank you, Victoria, for coming through for me and for my partner, the  ""hard to wow self proclaimed flower snob.""",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 5.0
I usually don't write reviews unless I'm really happy. As a mother you always want what is best for your child. To me that was Dr. Gookin he attempts to make your child comfortable and helps you understand what he recommends. He doesn't push you into making a decision and is willing to try to accommodate you if he feels like it will benefit your child. Dr. Gookin is friendly and takes the time to make sure all your answers are answered. I will continue to refer my friends and family over to Dr. Gookin.,Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 5.0

Oh I love this place. Its in a shopping center in a residential area in north Wilmington. Easy access from 95. It's built on a chipotle/ qdoba model with a lot more options for tacos or burritos. Guacamole is extra. We have ordered their chicken and fish burrito bowls and they don't disappoint. Their are too many toppings that you can choose from. Extra sauces are available free and are delicious. Prices are pretty reasonable. Husband and I got two burrito bowls for less than $20 and we finished it in 2 meals so totally worth it.

"Ever since the closing of Copper Country I've been in a funk...until MMM recently opened their doors.  The store occupies a huge building (formerly Tres Amigos) holding over 80 dealers (many of them from Copper Country).  The store is open & airy with a neat industrial look.  The dealers (each running their individual spaces) stock everything from shabby chic, to industrial steam punk, military, kitchen, furniture, jewelry and you name it.  Staff was very helpful and friendly.  And unlike Copper...this place is air conditioned!  Third weekend of the month is 10% off everything in the store and they will have monthly sidewalk sales where anyone can set up in the back parking lot.  In addition, various dealers run their own sales (viewed on a board at the entrance).

"My vacation to New Orleans wasn't all fun and games.  My girlfriend and I decided to get a little culture and tour the Southern Food & Beverage Museum.  Located in the Riverwalk, SoFaB celebrates the history of Southern, specifically New Orleans and Louisiana, food and drink. While a small museum as museums go (Hey, I live in the DC-area and everything is a small museum after you've visited the Smithsonian!), it contains a lot of information and interesting displays in the small space.  As an added bonus, it also incorporates the Museum of the American Cocktail, which chronicles the history and evolution of cocktails in America.  Apparently, food and drink events are held regularly at the museum.  Unfortunately, I arrived too late to enjoy an absinthe tasting held at the museum earlier in the week.

Furthermore, their service is excellent and since I frequent them often, they treat myself and my friends like family.  There is quite a bit of merriment to go along with the amazingly tasty fare, which is a great combination.  My favorite items there are the Seafood Salad (strips of 7 kinds of sashimi laid over mixed baby greens...VERY healthy!), the Spider Roll, and the basic Rainbow Roll.

This place carries a large selection of Chinese pastries as well at the lowest prices possible with good tasty flavors.  We usually get the pineapple, roast pork and curry beef buns, egg tarts, coffee Swiss roll and my favorite, sweetheart cake with winter melon paste filling but all the other pastries are also very good.

"Melos, this is my love letter to you.  I have never written one before, not even to my spouse or my sixth grade crush. But you are something special.  I have consumed a lot of pizza in my life.  Some were cheap (yes, I am talking about you Totinos, you delicious nostalgic digestive clogging ""pizza""), others were easy and came over as soon as I picked up the phone (Papa, Dom, The Hut).  There were the beauties from the motherland (brick built w/ lovely, dark backsides), LaLaland (CPK, you won me over with chicken and BBQ), and the thick ones from the windy city (Gordianos, you are a mystery underneath all that red).  And who can forget the big floppy pieces I met in the big apple (Not Rays, I knew you briefly but I loved you) and beantown (Fast Eddies, you may have come in on a disintegrating plate stashed in a cheap stapled brown bag, but you won me over, drunken annoying & loud undergrads be dammed!).  But Melos, you are perfection.   You greet me warmly when I walk in the door.  You are no nonsense - I can only have you five ways. You tell me I can hang around, but it has to be outside -- I can't breathe or move in your tiny space.  That's ok because each bite exceeds my expectations. Your cute cupped pepperoni makes my mouth water, and my tastebuds rejoice in your light but rich (how can that possibly be??) sauce.    Do you make everyone feel that way? Yes, even my spouse is in on it, with your beautiful garden bounty on a pie.  We have to sneak in early for lunch so we can have you right away.    Confession: I felt uncomfortable writing this.

"To start, this restaurant is not vegetarian friendly. They have a ""vegetarian"" burrito on their menu along with ""vegetarian"" fajitas, however they are not vegetarian. We came to learn that the black beans are cooked in pork fat and the rice is cooked in chicken stock. So unfortunately the menu is not represented accurately, because pork and chicken shouldn't be classified as being vegetarian.  The salsa tasted like tomato purée and the guacamole was basically lime juice with a side of avocado. No flavor or spice.  The cauliflower tacos were also very very dry and had no sauce. The cauliflower that was stuffed inside was also partially cooked cauliflower (you could feel a bite of raw cauliflower). As a side to that, because we were vegetarian, they served a bowl of mushy squash...

"Red Door East , Me likey.. It's definitely all about a laid back hang out kind of vibe paired with some off the wall decorations to peruse. I went when the place was packed and found the bartender to be extremely efficient. I didn't really sample the food but it appears to be pretty normal bar fare.   I believe it was here that I happened upon a bruised and bloody biker partaking of a couple of shots. I asked him if he was OK and he said he took a nasty spill off his bike and was going to have some tequila before he went to get stitched up. I applauded this even though I wondered if this may give the medical staff pause. Perhaps they would ponder the question which came first the wreck or the liquor? Alas, I bought him another shot and helped him call a cab thinking, I love East Nashville.   The only down side for the patio is that the sunsets in the summer make a wicked glare so if you are stuck on the wrong side of a table, bring a hat and some glasses.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0

"I've come here multiple times and allow a common mistake no problem. The food is good, manager is funny. This time however, the waitress was the worst I've encountered. She was a short Mexican young girl with dark hair (Ana or Anna I think I heard). She not only refused to correctly make the food as I explained, but she argued with me, rolled her eyes, gave an attitude to her manager, and refused to speak up in a busy restaurant. Tony mentioned to me that she has had many problems in past. Reality is I think her customer service skills aren't there. I get how restaurants are, and you kinda need to fake it. This girls looks mean, unapproachable, and unwilling to fix mistakes. Might be time to look for some replacements. Happened a couple weeks ago.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 3.0
I had the grouper fried in peanut oil served over fresh greens. I am not the most experienced eater of seafood. This was the best fish I have tasted though. I thought the gator bites were no good though! I just liked to eat them because they would eat me if given the chance. It was too chewy. Like chewing on a piece of fried fat!

"I have been too a lot of Asian buffets over the last yea,r while my girlfriend has been pregnant, and this one checks all the boxes for what we are looking for in a buffet.  They have everything you can want for Asian buffet food goes (fried rice, sticky rice, chicken, lo mein,  crab rangoon, egg roll, won ton soup) all of which was hot and delicious. The Miso soup is a must have. They also have some items for a picky eater, who only likes french fries and nuggets. The general tso chicken was my favorite. They kept it clean and the attendant was alway making sure the food was stocked. People have said it is expensive since it is $15 but that is because they include the most important food item, the crab legs, which are hot, fresh and they actually have crackers for you to use. The sushi was awesome. I'm not much of a raw fish guy but they had so many choices and it was kept fresh and clean. The desserts were simple but I recommend the fried sugar donuts with ice cream on top.   This is by far one of the best Asian buffets we have been to in a long while. They don't skimp on the crab legs and actually make sure you get some nice plump ones. Enjoy!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

I haven't even received my lenses yet and am already impressed with their customer service. Due to a FedEx epic failure I didn't receive my lenses on the scheduled day. I emailed customer service simply to notify them of the FedEx issue and they immediately offered to extend the rental period a day. When I related that I appreciated the offer but it wouldn't be any benefit to me since I would be leaving town and not able to take advantage of the extension; they told me they would credit me for the lost day of rental.  It wasn't even their problem (FedEx falsified an attempted delivery report) and they stepped up to provide excellent customer service. Hard to find these days but highly noted and duty regarded.

"Best of the Best! I moved from New Orleans after Katrina, but when I visit, Brigsten's is at the top of my list for high end restaurants. It is always super fresh and super delicious, with a very friendly and helpful wait staff. I read some comments about the dated decor, but that's it's character. It's not a sparkling, new McDonald's. It's old school food, served old school, but in a casual setting. You can get all dressed up, but you don't have to. It's much better than home cooking, but served by your family at home. I give Brigsten's a 5 star, but would prefer a 10 star rating. The file gumbo is perfect, the duck perfection, the garlic laden cochon du lait (pork roast) amazing, fresh fish dishes almost flopping on your plate. New Orleans has many high end restaurants, but none better than Brigsten's, and although it's not cheap, Frank won't take your life savings in return for an awesome dinner.

"I actually LOVE Bakersfield so I feel terrible about giving it a 2 but I have a reason behind it. I went with a group of friends this past weekend and knew we would have to wait awhile because you usually do and we had a large party.   After waiting 90 minutes we finally were informed our table was ready. We had been enjoying ourselves down in the basement and got drinks. Btw, the bartended in the basement was so sweet and friendly. Once we got through the crowd of people at Bakersfield, which is always packed full of people, I was informed our table had been given away because it took us LESS than 2 minutes to get to the hostess. Thankfully the girl apologized for giving our table away because they usually wait longer but she said the wait was long for tables and they just moved on to the next party. I have to say though, the building is SO packed that they need to give parties a few more minutes to get to the hostess before giving the table away.  We then waited another 60 minutes for a table to seat our party.   Overall the food was great but I can't believe they gave our table away so quickly without calling us or texting saying ""last call"" or something.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 2.0

"This past Friday armed with a reservation for 7:00 and a gift card, Dining Partner and I took on Maggiano's. We've been here plenty of times, but usually only when we have a gift card or an event held here. The restaurant was very crowded and very loud, as it has been every time we've been here. Our waiter Ryann was friendly and thoguhtful when recommending dishes for us. Dining partner had a side Caesar salad for an appetizer and I had the fried zucchini.  The fried zucchini portion was huge, in fact I ate it for three meals. The dipping sauce for the zucchini was so delicious. When our waiter Ryann recommended some options for entrees, he told us the lighter takes were pretty good. Lighter take is a smaller portion/lower calorie dish than the traditional classics. Dining Partner ate all of his veal marsala (lighter take) and I ate about half of my Fettuccine Alfredo (lighter take) that came with grilled chicken and asparagus.  For dessert, we stuffed ourselves with the Chocolate Zuccotto Cake. If you've ever seen the movie Matilda think of Bruce eating the chocolate cake. This ""piece"" of cake was HUGE. This latest experience at Maggiano's has altered my automatic dismissal of chain restaurants.

"I really wanted to like this place, however it just missed the mark. The interior needs just a little bit more to make it work. I love the minimal color palette and furniture, however some art, some plants, maybe some different lighting would go along way. It's just a little sterile. The food -- again, I really wanted to like it, but it just fell flat. Given the food pedigree background of the owners, I just thought it would be a better dining experience. I hope they can work through the issues and hang on because Inglewood and Gallatin Pike need independent places like this badly. For the development owner, I think this speaks to the power of good design. I would also suggest that they need a blade sign or something on the exterior.

"What elevates one location of a homogeneous fast food chain above any other? Sometimes it's the layout, sometimes it's the employees, sometimes it's the parking, and in rare cases, it's the food. Here, it's the lines, or lack thereof. I will say this in one separate line so it's clear:  I came here twice, and both times there was no line.   This is like bizarro In-n-Out. Every other location I've ever been to, regardless of day or time, has a standing line. Often almost to the door. However here? Nope. I mean, it's not like the lines take forever. But still, just walking in and walking straight up to the counter is a unique experience for me.   That aside, the burgers here are as fantastically delicious as those at other locations. And the fries are just as bad. Just get the burgers or grilled cheese and a drink and call it a day.

There is a nice covered outside patio also.  We went for lunch and tried the chips and salsa, a mahi mahi bowl, and an ahi tuna bowl.   Chips were freshly fried and warm, the salsa was good, on the milder side.  The bowls were nice sized portions with a lot of interesting flavors and ingredients in them which all worked well together.  The fish was fresh and properly cooked as well.   They have these really cool biodegradable agave straws for the drinks. Much better than icky paper straws.   I'm glad this place opened up in our area as we needed a Mexican place besides the overcrowded VIP.

"From start to finish, you will be left wanting more.  The dishes really complemented each other and I really enjoyed most of them.   N.B. This is a cash only establishment.  Start: butter and 3 kinds of fresh baked bread. Butter was soft and smooth, but not homemade.  Appetizer: We had caviar, champagne jelly with oyster. It was very refreshing, probably my favorite part of the meal.  Entrees: Intermezzo was served in between courses so you can get ready for the next meal. We had the  Foie Gras - I usually don't like Foie Gras since a lot of places either over cook or undercook it, but I really liked the duck fat with the seared Foie Gras. The inside is cooked perfectly to my liking.  Tasmanian sea trout - perfectly seared,   partridge(I was it was squab instead), careful for the shotgun rounds haha.   mushroom soup - very earthly flavors, nice tone down.  goat cheese - a bit too strong for me since I usually don't eat sharp cheese   souffle -It was made very well, light and fluffy.    I didn't expect the experience to be so superb since the location wasn't the best, really nice surprise. The waiters and host were knowledgeable and attentive, I really like the small dining room, its quite cozy and allows the waiters to be very accessible. The best part about the dessert is the chef himself comes out to check on your experience. The experience is worth every dollar you spend, you have got to try it yourself.

"i usually don't write about places so saturated with egos and center city arrogance but my brunch at parc on sunday was decent and surprisingly acceptable. it was a typical gorgeous phila sunday and my friend and i wanted to eat somewhere fun. so i suggested parc, only because you can sit outside and overlook the park, not so much because of the food or the ambiance. i enjoy the location of the restaurant, i do believe Mr. Starr chose a very good plot of land, however as i mentioned before, i do not like the center city/ NY wannabe, mentality behind this restaurant. Yes, it is kinda expensive and random show-offs do pull up in front with their range rovers and Lamborghini's but this is phila and that extravagance isn't as widely accepted or condoned as it is in NYC. My friend knew the hostess so we skipped the 35 minute for a table outside and sat at a nice clean table on the corner of the park. within minutes we had a waiter who recommended the steak and eggs entree. however my friend wanted eggs benedict and i chose the cheeseburger.  after about 10 minutes 2 men pull up in a loud Ferrari and idle outside devon/parc pretending like they can't find a parking spot and in doing so leave their engine running for 10 minutes. not only is this annoying but i felt like getting up and going over there and telling them that there is a consensus that no one cares about their car/ opulence. AS IF THAT WASN'T EXPECTED.  the food was decent. my cheeseburger was tasty, came with a surplus of fries. my friends eggs were cooked well- she asked for lox instead of the usual ham and the waiter seemed fine with the request.  overall i am happy with the brunch selection. it was a great day to sit outside in center city and until i find maybe a less expensive place to eat brunch near the park, unfortunately parc will have to do.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

My husband ordered the meatball parm sub and when it came out, it was eggplant parm and we had to send it back.  The fries were more like potato wedges (but without any seasoning and not cooked thoroughly), they looked crispy on the outside, but were raw on the inside.  The meatballs, once they came out, were salty and burnt tasting.  I ordered the tuna melt.  The tuna had no veggies or mayo, it was just chopped/minced tuna with cheese on top which I had to cover in ketchup since it was so dry.  My side salad had lettuce with brown spots so was obviously not fresh.  I would not recommend anyone eat here, there are so many restaurants to choose from, I wish we had a better meal on our one afternoon in Santa Barbara.

Thankfully, we only had to wait a few minutes for our table because it was cold where we were waiting as people kept opening the front door to go in and out while letting in a frigid breeze. We were seated in a strange area of the restaurant, sandwiched between the beer fridges and the deli counter. At least it was warm, and it was great that 6 of us were able to be seated together.  We had come from a brewery, so I didn't order a beer, but they had a pretty good selection. I ended up ordering the beer-battered fish sandwich for dinner. It came with fries and was very reasonable at $12. The fries were great -- I finished every last one of them. The sandwich was good, too, but the bun was a little soggy, and the fish tasted a little bland. I would probably order something else next time.

"I feel like Guo Bin is a dying breed of Chinese restaurant. It's one of those old school places with table service that is decorated like a Pagoda exploded. Yes, there's a fish tank. Most Chinese restaurants now are your basic cheap strip mall carry out Chinese OR a smaller more authentic place with a specialized focus. Also, Guo Bin is on the ground level of a building that is a senior living center. I've probably been eating here though since I was in high school. The food is definitely more expensive than the basic cheap strip mall carry out Chinese but you know what? It's way better! On my most recent visit my grandmother and I each ordered a bowl of Hot N Sour soup and then shared the Moo Shu Shrimp. The Hot N Sour soup has that perfect play of vinegar and black pepper. The broth did not have that sickly thick cornstarch taste. It was nice and thin. Moo Shu Shrimp is a mixture of shrimp, scrambled egg, mushroom, veggies, etc. It's wrapped in a pancake laden with plum sauce. Theirs was great! Used to be a pretty common dish but you don't see it everywhere anymore. The service is fair and I'm sure I'll be back for the very nostalgic comfort food and predictable décor.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
Great local mom and pop type of operation.  Skate sharpening is second to none here and custom jerseys are very easily set up with the specialists here at the shed.

It's like a party in your mouth that you don't want to end. Over easy eggs with salsa under a corn tortilla with beans. In house made tortillas were so good, I don't like my tortillas with flour on them (powder) these were not. The salsa was really good as well.

"We just stayed here and had a great time.  Our family really rates this place as a 4.5  Apparently they just reopened a couple of weeks ago after some devastating mudslides.  The place looks beautiful, the staff were wonderful, and we highly recommend it to anyone staying in the area.  Positives: 1.  The best part was the amazing staff.  Everyone was super friendly and effortlessly helpful.  We were greeted by name as we arrived.  No, we aren't anyone special.  I heard the staff do that numerous times.  I might have even been a trifle annoying with all my questions and requests but they never wavered. 2.  Parking is valet only but reasonable (15 dollars a day).  Again , the attendants were very helpful and we were greeted by name.  The service was quick. 3.  The room was pretty close to spotless.  Special kudos out to management and the housekeeping staff.  The room looked great so, of course, I was compelled to go looking for grime.  Sorry, I couldn't help myself.  There was no goopy goop in the bathroom floor corners.  There was no dust on the light fixtures.  The grout and tiles were bright without any sign of dirt on the top.  There was a fresh shower curtain.  Our room smelled of fresh air.  I made myself stop at this point but you get the idea - all good and very pleasant. 4.  For a king sized standard room, the bathroom is small but this is an historical hotel (1928) and was expected.  However, the towels were very fluffy, we had the use of two robes, and there was a no-fog magnified mirror.  Not spectacular but comfortable. 5.  The hotel retains its significant historic charm.  It was financed by Charlie Chaplin as a retreat from Hollywood and the place just oozes old world charm.  There is an incredible old Otis elevator replete with a metal gate and original buttons inside.  I loved getting to step into history like this. 6.  The bed was super comfy and felt luxurious.  The room was small but had an art decor sort of charm. 7.  No coffee maker in the room but there is coffee, tea and water downstairs just off the lobby 24 hours a day.  The coffee was a yummy Kona blend, much better than what you get from individual pods so I was very satisfied.  There was a nice variety of teas along with several varieties of sugar (regular, artificial, honey) along with a variety of creamers.  In the mornings, they put out an array of wrapped pasties and a dispenser of orange juice. 8.  Finally, my DH asked me to mention their work out facilities which he very much appreciated.    Negatives: 1.  As I mentioned above, the bathroom is small.  This only became an issue when I went looking for a place to put my stuff.  There are a couple of shelves, which I appreciated and used.  However, I needed perhaps a hook on the door to hang my clothes.  This seems like it could be a simple fix which would make the room more user friendly. 2.  The website needs to be updated!  It still claims that their restaurants will be opening up in 2017.  I am not too frustrated by this because I know they have been recovering from the mudslides.  However, now that they are open again, they should spend a little energy making sure that the website (their public face) is up-to-date.  In Conclusion: We had a wonderfully relaxing stay here!

Staff at Blackfish is (are?) A++,  as is the quality and execution of the food. The salmon was hyper-fresh and tasty. The risotto was so professionally created... My gripe: The advance menu posted BELUGA LENTILS with the salmon and ROASTED BEET salad for one of the appetizers.  I came with this in mind, almost drooling for them. However, neither came to show. The tradeoff was Basmati rice replacing the lentils (blah !) and tomatoes replacing the beets. Tomatoes were so good but I've been eating them all summer.

"Boy, am I full! I didn't even eat any of the Italian Wedding Soup I ordered as I was just stuffed.  My coworker and I came here after the new grand ""reopening."" LaScala's Fire has been open about a week and used to just be LaScala's. In these COVID-19 times, we were upset when they closed thinking it was for good. Thank God it wasn't!  LaScala's Fire has a very easy to use online ordering website and I used it without any difficulties to place a pick-up order. I love how with certain items they move into sub-menus for extra add-ons or take-aways. The price adjusts accordingly for the add-ons. After placing your order, they give you a time it should be ready and it was!  The Alicia's salad was nothing much in way of the salad itself. Greens, chickpeas, onions, tomatoes, but I added some calamari which upped the game, and the dressing they kept to the side. However, the gigantic sphere of a meatball with a huge amount of ricotta and red sauce was almost a meal in itself. Perfectly cooked with an almost crispy outer rim, juicy inside and so much flavor. Mixed with the ricotta was perfect. I was not the biggest fan of the red sauce, but everyone has their preferences.   The fried calamari came back to work a little on the soggy side, and they were too salty for me. Next time I'll try at the restaurant itself and I bet they'll be better. Most of that came home for someone else in the family to enjoy.  Lastly, dessert was so decadent. The zeppoles were perfectly fried dough balls in powdered sugar with an outstanding cannoli cream over them. Then, to somehow make them even better, a raspberry dipping sauce. OMG.   My coworker really liked her chicken Caesar salad that she added bacon to. Couldn't finish it but did chow down on the nice grilled chicken. Had to save room for the zeppoles!   LaScala's Fire also looked awesome inside in gleaming white and has plenty of seating. The staff were using all COVID-19 precautions. We inquired about a luncheon and they said they are taking things day by day as the rules seem to change by the second in Philadelphia. However, they can accommodate.  The online ordering menu allows for a tip to be added, and you pay with credit. $67 for everything including tax and tip - 2 salads, soup, calamari, and zeppoles!

"8/8/20 excellent experience in the midst of covid. I honestly have no idea how restaurants will weather this. Now at 25% indoor capacity. I'm trying to support them while we are lucky enough to have them. I expect most will go under and not survive.  You have to wear a mask entering and leaving your table. It's ok to sit at your table without a mask. Servers wear masks the whole time. The tables have the chairs up in between to create the 6 feet of ""social distance"".  And create barely an indoor dining capacity.   We sat inside and the multitude of new standards are definitely being followed at the restaurant. A different experience for sure. I am still very thankful that we got to sit in and be waited on. Something I no longer take for granted.  I ordered shrimp corn soft shell tacos. Upgraded to supreme w lettuce, tomato and sour cream sauce. OH. MY. GOD!!!  So delicious! Son got tinga  alambre and was in heaven.  Sons girlfriend ordered 3 tostadas all with different toppings, steak, chorizo, and  I forget the last one. Served w plastic silverware, upon disposable dishes.   Excellent experience. I love El Limon and I surely hope they can  make it through these unprecedented times.      Monica was our wonderful server last night 2/15/19. We were all pretty hungry and my son was treating me to El Limon.  He ordered up the chips and guac & salsa so I decided not to get my standard nachos as my meal.  I enjoyed the nachos very much they were served not really with salsa but a delicious Pico de Gallo chopped tomatoes, onions and fresh cilantro. The portion of guac was enormous and as always absolutely delicious!  I ordered the delicious shrimp burrito w rice and got the refried beans on the side. It was delicious with the tomatillo sauce and the sour cream sauce with crispy lettuce and diced fresh tomatoes. Plenty of tasty shrimp and rice were inside and it satisfied my craving. My son ordered the Mexican Al pastor Sandwich with a fried egg too! It was tasty and the portion was massive. We saw some chopped avocado and he opted fir jalapeños.

We had Parker rolls, mushroom toast, sea bass, scallops, fried chicken, and ribs with a side of broccoli. Our drinks were well balanced and our desserts were the perfect ending. They brought us out candles to wish upon as an extra treat.

We had a fabulous time at this restaurant.  The service was excellent and the atmosphere was very warm and friendly.  I did read the reviews about people complaining about the wait (despite making a reservation) so I took it upon myself to call a half hour prior to my reze to see if they were running on time.  I should have been a rocket scientist!!! I'm so smart!  I would recommend doing that!,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"So this morning (Thursday) my friends and I decided to travel to this place and compensate our funds, the first mistake was the woman's terrible breath at the counter, the second was that my friend ordered a milkshake, received chocolate milk, never got his milkshake after asking twice for it and then saw that both chocolate milk and the milkshake were on the bill, next our waitress was somewhat rude and unfriendly to us, and me working in a restaurant expect nothing but smiles even if they're fake from all staff because that's what brings people back and gets tips, but I guess this dump doesn't like to do so but who cares I'll take my business to a place that doesn't make simple food you can make yourself at your house.

"At first, I was really annoyed because my appointment was at 3:30 and I was still waiting at 4:10pm. It's a good thing Yelp won't allow me to post a review on my mobile device!  If I had ranted in the waiting room, it would have been very premature.  Once I was called back, it was quickly explained that one of the technicians had gone home sick and they were in rough shape with appointments backing up.  Then, when I got to see Dr. Manning, he took such a good deal of time with me and explained things so thoroughly that I couldn't help but be impressed.  They also apologized for the wait and promised that it was unusual.  I believed them!

"I used to think this was a great spot but I will be finding a new place to stay when I come to Reno. Staff is unprofessional and rude.  I needed to use the washing machine at the hotel (spilt something at dinner). I called to make sure they had one and the guy told me where to go. He said NOTHING about the dryer being broke. I put my things in the wash and saw a sign on the dryers that they were broke. When I called him back he seemed irritated and let me know one of them works. I went to use it and both were broke, he basically told me tough luck and that no one could help. I asked if there was another marriot property nearby I might be able to dry my things. No he said, i hung up b/c he was just so rude. Then my husband called back - didnt realize i had already talked to the guy and the guy was like look I am here on my day off. I mean really? To people paying to stay at a hotel you are going to go into your victim sob story about working? Then each morning we woke up we were being charged, $60, next day $80 then another $60 and they kept apologizing saying we are sorry its a glitch! I am so done with this place. I am still trying to get the other charge off as she assured me it would be handled but nope it has not been. When I called today the lady was nice but has no authority to do the refund and no one is around that has that authority. This place needs to get some highly trained courteous staff or they are going under. I came here b/c of the newer facility but Upon arrival our room smelled like cat litter.

"I recommend EVERYONE try The Gallier sandwich. Appropriately named because it is this restaurant's signature dish. It is a fried oyster sandwich that includes pickled turnips and bacon inside a ciabatta bun. The oysters are not fried too much, so you can still taste them but you get that crunchy texture as well. So good! I learned that the turnips were pickled in house, and I also got to meet the lady who created sandwich (she was really funny and nice).  I ate at the bar on a slow night and struck up a nice conversation with the bartender (whose name was also David). I ordered a Bourbon Milk Punch and had one of the best meals here.

"My husband and I stayed at this property in some time last year.  The customer service upon check in was friendly and the rooms were well kept and very clean, but we had a bad experience with the owner of the hotel later that evening in the lounge.  He was very dirty and treated the restaurant and bar staff poorly.  Then, after a few beers, he stumbled around introducing himself as the owner.  He was interupting the guests conversations and literally hanging on people.  Putting his arm around strangers.  That was not the problem.  Later that evening, after we had returned from dinner, we saw him sitting at the bar, chain smoking and gambling; which looked to us as extremely unprofessional.  Then, we looked over to see him relieving himself underneath the bar, while he was sitting there gambling.  My husband and I were completely disgusted and left.  We had made a complaint to the front desk at check in, but it seems this is a family owned hotel, and that was his son.

"We decided to forgo the insane crowds of Sips-happy folks at Zavino, Nodding Head, Oyster House, Ladder 15...and finally stopped into the Happy Rooster. Definitely an institution in my book - my grandfather spent many a happy hour here when he worked at Liberty Place and I have been a couple of times during some booze-filled evenings. As I understand it, it's changed hands a few times recently.   The space is tiny but cozy. We had great service as well. I am surprised about the lack of drafts and the beer list wasn't exactly cheap (most were $7-8) or inspired. I stuck with a glass of house white (also not inexpensive at $8). A cocktail with Stoli was $9 (and tiny).   Complimentary bread was pretty standard. I know that everything is NOT going to be JG Domestic's warm parker house rolls.   The chilled red pepper and tomato soup was absolutely delicious. Seriously, I wanted to order another bowl to take home. Great flavor and a kick!   Beer batter fried pickles. Oh my word. These are bread and butter pickles and frying them was seriously inspired. I love the slices, not the spears, and these are tasty.   This is probably one of the rare times in which I've ordered a burger medium rare and it IS medium rare. It's a big burger - topped with bacon-onion jam and cheddar. I wish the cheddar was a thick slice. It looked like it was sprinkled, which was...odd. Bacon onion jam was pretty baller though.   I tend to forget this place is here, which is sad.

So if you're in a party mood then give this place a 5 star rating.

The sandwich was literally the smallest Media Noche I've ever had and I've been eating Cuban food for a long, long time.  That said, I wasn't hungry at all afterwards, so maybe it's just me wanting more of that tasty sandwich.  The Papa Rellena was perfectly cooked and was wonderfully flavorful with a nice slathering of added hot sauce.  I'm not sure what restaurant this was before, maybe an Ihop or something, but there was plenty of seating.

"This place is awesome! Great food, great service.... small restaurant in a strip mall but you really get a lot of food for the price, and it's very delicious. I have tried their lunch buffet once just to get a feel for the various offerings. My favorite dish is the chicken korma which I continue to order as take-out.The naan bread is fantastic! The rice is delicious too, esp their egg rice. Not sure what the word for that is... but it has eggs in it and it was on their lunch buffet. I didn't quite like the chicken tikka masala as much as other places' but it's still not bad. The korma is so friggin' good though. I get mine with chicken but I would like to try other kinds too. My mouth is watering as I type this... caution - don't write stuff on Yelp when hungry - you might lose your mind!  Oh also, their raita yogurt stuff is pretty good too...it manages to calm the storm that is my stomach after eating even the mildest mild curry. I have issues with spicy food in general so I can't eat Indian food or anything slightly spicy unless I take the proper precautions beforehand. E.g. lots of different types of medicine. But it's so worth it. SOOO worth it. OK time to get some korma, LOL. I would give them a 5th star if they delivered or had some agreement with grubhub to deliver... sometimes I am too exhausted to drive anywhere or incapacitated, so that would be an awesome bonus.

I did have sangria, although I don't have it often and can't say whether it was a good representation. It did the trick, in any case.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Le Meridien is an upscale hotel right in the heart of Philadelphia.  The place is a total hipster hangout; very modern cool ambiance in a very old building.  The rooms were very clean and intimate.  The décor is trendy but not in an over the top way that makes you feels uncomfortable.

We were at this place on a cold day, so my fiancee and I both decided on the ginger honey tea. I was not impressed! The tea was spicy( I realize that it would be slightly spicy, but I did not expect this).

"The cavatelli con broccoli that I ate here was super rich and creamy.  Pretty tasty, as it's hard to mess up a sauce that consists of butter, cream and garlic.  It was the temperature of molten hot lava and I am pretty sure the broccoli was frozen...lots of stalk, not a lot of head.  Boo.  The house salad I ordered was drenched in dressing and was almost enough to convert me to be one of those, ""I'll take it on the side"" types of salad eating peeps.  Iceburg lettuce, yada, yada, yada.  Went here with my stepmom and the ladies on her side of the family for a girl's night out that consisted of dinner and movie going...Rizzo's was a convenient location in relation to the theater, and a non-national chain option (as per request of one of the other ladies).  A better option than Shmapplebees or The Pasta House...but nowhere close to as awesome as other Italian food I've laid taste buds on in the Lou.  The place smelled like smoke when we walked in, which I will never find appetizing, and our server was not too speedy.  He had maybe three tables and was generally absent.

It wasn't busy when I got there and I was seen immediately by Adreas (sp). Who was very meticulous and a real master of his craft. I had an idea of what I wanted, and as I was pulling it up on my phone it dawned on me that no image I could grab from google could compare to knowledge this matured, professional held. So I let him go at it and was glad I did. I felt like it was a real transformation. The rest of the day I've been getting compliments on my confidence, and of course the hair.

"The best part about this steakhouse is its wait staff who work very hard to be attentive and informative about the extensive menu.  The food is just dreadful...this had to be the WORST steakhouse I've ever been to.  I also don't understand the reviews because the food was just awful.  We had to tell ourselves that it was an adventure even if it was an adventure that went horribly wrong.  The restaurant is one of those kitschy places that reminds me a bit of either Disneyland's Haunted House or Clearman's Steak & Stein (though to be fair, Clearman's food is actually decent...just the ambiance).  Very themed with various rooms and then, for the desserts being served upstairs in these wooden pods for each table.  The atmosphere was a novelty but a cute one with decent ambiance for conversations unlike a lot of more modern restaurants that ""boom.""  The food is the main downside.  And if you're paying $300+ for 3 people, 2 of whom don't drink, this is steep when the meal is worse than eating at Denny's.  I haven't been to a Denny's since high school, but at least, I remember the breakfasts being decent.  We literally threw away our left-over filet and Delmonico (ribeye) steaks once we got home - yes, we wanted to spare our server his feelings at how dreadful the food really was.  My biggest beef, no pun intended, is that nothing was seasoned correctly.  The French Onion soup was so salty and runny that other than the cheese layer, wasn't edible.  The toast that came with it was so dry and crunchy.  The salad and the baked potato were the only edible parts of our meal.  Now, onwards to the steaks...how are they dry aged??!!  These were the most bland steaks we've ever had, plus so undercooked.  I kept thinking that they should have used the salt in the French Onion soup on the steaks - some salt and pepper would not have gone amiss.  Also, at most places, I have to order medium rare to nearly rare because it's always slightly overcooked.  Here, the medium rare was basically searing on the outside and then, red on the inside.  I didn't mind this as much as the fact that the meat was so darn bland.  I don't understand how you can make filet taste like a piece of unseasoned meat unless it WAS unseasoned!  It takes a lot to make rib eye tastes bland too!  We were just flabbergasted, but it made for a good after dinner conversation in the car ride home.  I can't say that I've been to the best steakhouses in the country, having only been to Ruth Chris', V Steakhouse in NYC when it was around and Prime Steakhouse in Vegas.  But I have ordered steaks directly from ranches such as KC Cattle Company and venison from Broken Arrow Ranch so I know good meat.    This place is more about the kitschy experience than the food so know what you're getting and you'll be fine.  Personally, I will never return.  Nor can I in good conscience recommend this place for anyone who is a true foodie.  The wait staff that we encountered were all very professional and nice.",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 1.0

"Phenomenal burger, and extraordinary service at the bar!  So I've got this thing going on right now with burgers.  I don't know why because I've got some blazing high uric acid levels these days and I shouldn't even be eating the things.  Maybe I was a lion in my former life.  I just can't stop feeding on red meat.  Anywho, medical and fantastic stories aside, La Chica and I  ventured over to Corey Ave. after a long day of bar hopping along the beach, starting at Crabby Bill's and ending at the Postcard Inn to view the 8:02 PM sunset.  That's a lot of distance to cover in Crocs!  So naturally, we were hungry, and we've heard a lot about this place called Willy's and how good their burgers are.  So curiously, we waltzed in, but there was no hope of ever feeding there in a timely manner.  There was about a 1 hour wait to be seated, and the bartender told me the wait on burgers is about 40 minutes.  Ain't no damn burger worth almost 2 hours of waiting, so we bounced.  That's when we noticed Oyster Shucker across the street.  I'm not much of an Oyster fan, so I was a bit hesitant to enter, but I'm really glad I did.  First off, there was NO WAIT to be seated, and there was 1 person at the bar.  The atmosphere was nice, spacious and well air conditioned, unlike the joint across the street.  We bumped bellies with the bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender, Eric.  Dude was cool as hell, and took care of us the entire time we hung out.  We ordered some PEEL & EAT SKRIMPS, OYSTERS and look oh what they have on the menu, a $10 BURGER!  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a FLAME-GRILLED 10 oz. burger, and it instantly landed in my top 5.  It was that delicious.  While struggling to finish this thing, several people inside the establishment advised me that the burgers across the street are indeed good, but not flame-grilled, so I think I landed at the better burger establishment.

Today I had the prime rib and it was kinda tough (Medium). Wish I ordered something else.   What has been consistently good on the menu is their burgers and buffalo chicken sandwich.  Shocking I know.  From here on out, I'll stick with those for sure!  Blooming onions are always ok, depends on the grease factor between locations.

I'm sad to report this place used to be one of my fave places to eat & drink on Main. The decor & layout is very neat so it's saddening to me that everytime I go the food & service is going down hill. We went with 2 other couples & nobody enjoyed their meal. And all 6 of us ate different items. The only food items that were enjoyed were onion rings & my friends hubby had a salad that he enjoyed . All the sandwiches that came out came with garnishments of rotten lettuce . One of the burgers didn't have chipotle mayo on it & when my friend asked the server about it she said didn't know what was supposed to be on the burger but she would go check. She told her she thought it was a BBQ sauce . The server didn't know the menu at all. When we ordered she had to double check a lot of things because she was unsure. So when she came back she confirmed to my friend it was the chipotle mayo NOT BBQ sauce(totally not similar) and at that point who cares? If server knows a sauce is suppose to be on it but nothing was on it just get the sauce that the customer is asking for verses making the customer wait to walk away & check to come back & then ask if she wants sauce so she walks away again to get it. I ordered the boiled peel n eat shrimp & for the price I couldn't believe 6 regular sized shrimp came out! I almost only orders that but glad I got onion rings because I would have left starving ! And the shrimp didn't taste good in fact I left feeling sick to my stomach & I think it was from the shrimp . Than the server would bring us new drinks but not take away the empty cups so to clear the table we stacked them up at end of table & at one point 7 cups were stacked and sat for 10 minutes! Oh yeah and everybody had fries or onion rings & 3 pple had burgers and she didn't just bring ketchup and mustard to the table. So we had to ask her & she disappeared for a while and came back after almost 5 minutes. I wish we would have complained to her because with all the disappointment in the food & service we shouldn't have had to pay the price we did . The cooks should know not to put rotten lettuce on 3 plates & the burger should have came with the sauce verses her trying to peel apart the burger to spread it herself . And I only ate 2 shrimp and threw away the rest because it tasted bad too! So disappointed. ! I gave it 2 stars because the atmosphere is still great & our drinks were good .

About the same time saying something was ""the bomb"" was actually relevant.  Funky decor.  Eclectic food.  A menu thick enough it would have made Tolstoy proud.  And cheesecake.  Oh, the cheesecake.  Like a culinary colors of Benetton ad, this place was the freaking UN of cheesecake.  And 10 years later, that's exactly what it still is.  The Cheesecake factory hasn't changed; but the world around it has.  The food's still decent.  The cheesecake selection still unfathomable.  And the menu still has it's own zip code.  But it's stuck in a bit of a time warp.  Like the lady you see at Walmart that's darn proud she can still wear her Jordache jeans, the old CF is pretty determined to keep the status quo.  And why not?  It's still almost a two hour wait during busy times.  It's still kinda fun to enjoy the whole dated experience.

Very accommodating to a member of our party's dary and soy allergy.   The million dollar bacon was overcooked and too sweet for our liking.  The dairy free yogurt with fruit was outstanding.   Skillet eggs was very good.   Visiting but if I could I would go back.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Be careful of your credit cards, people. I have never set foot in this location. Somebody working at this Red Robin location in September MANUALLY ENTERED - not one, but TWO - cash advances for $500 each using our company credit card number that was stolen from a retail location in Red Deer. VISA and RCMP are working on the file, but, it's one thing to innocently take a fraudulent card, but when you process a ""cash advance"" at a place of business that doesn't deal in cash advances - either a staff member or a manager is crooked. Taking $500 cash from the float on two different occasions and then balancing the cash after doing so is no accident. That is something that should have been noticed at audit - and the fact that it wasn't, shows that the criminality is higher up the ladder than one would think...Shame on you Red Robin Sherwood Park!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I have been to Maynard's so many times; I'm not sure why I haven't posted a review sooner. It's one of my favorite spots in downtown Tucson. The food is consistently good, the outdoor patio is sweet, the service is always stellar, the Summer wine tastings are fun, and their private rooms are perfect for business meetings. Whatever the occasion and mood, Maynard's has you covered!  Their menu is always different each time I go and the food never disappoints. The presentation is also beautiful.  I've had many of their salads and entrees, and of course, dessert. Trust me, you want to save room for their rich and decadent deserts.   The wine tastings are also really nice as long as you don't mind a crowd. Get there early if you want to find a seat! I don't necessarily recommend a large party unless you plan to stand or get there before it starts to stake out a spot.   It is downtown so there isn't much metered parking. There is valet and I've always found a spot in the parking garage behind Hotel Congress.   If you haven't tried Maynard's yet, go! It's awesome!",Business Category: Grocery,Review Stars: 5.0

"One of my few complaints about the New Orleans food scene has been its lack of a decent Japanese ramen place. So last night when a friend and I stumbled upon this place on our way to R Bar, I had to stop and try it. We walked in right at 7 and were the only customers in the place for a while. When a server came over to take our order she barely seemed to speak a lick of English.   And then...HOLY SHIT!  The ramen we were served (we both ordered the curry ramen) was nothing less than sex served in a bowl. I wanted to bathe in it. At numerous points my friend and I looked at each other in wonderment, expressing mild disbelief that what we were consuming could be so fucking good. I started feeling overcome with sadness as I inched closer to the bottom of the bowl because it meant that the best meal I'd had in some time was nearing the end. I woke up this morning craving Ichi's ramen for breakfast.   Bottom line: this place is the real deal. I feel like a man who's been wandering the desert dying of thirst who's finally stumbled upon a reservoir of fresh water. New Orleans is now an even better place to eat because of Ichi's existence.

"If I could give this hotel 0 stars, I would. Do not stay here. I left a backpack (I know shame on me) but when I called barely 24 hours after checking out asking about the backpack, it of course wasn't found. The backpack was a 200 dollar backpack, and it had a pair of wireless Beats by Dre headphones in it, so of course it wasn't found (silly me for asking).  The house keeping staff decided to only clean up half of the room; what was wrong with the other half is beyond me. The hotel room was extremely dirty, the bathroom shower had black hair in it (prior to any of us using it). The A/C unit wouldn't stay cold, and our room was very stuffy. Our door wouldn't open until you threw your shoulder and some body weight into it. Their outlet/ electricity system was terrifying.   Yes, this hotel it old. But that isn't an excuse for cleanliness and functionality. It is also disappointing that this world has less and less honest people!

"I was very excited last year when I heard that Twin Peaks was planning on building FIVE locations in the NOLA area. My first Twin Peaks experience was in Baton Rouge last year. I really liked the atmosphere and staff at that location. Unfortunately the staff that they hired for the Metairie location didn't give me the same level of service. I'm talking about service that is downright unattentive. Some of the servers there sit around and talk amongst themselves while you sit there waiting for service.  The food here has been hit or miss lately. I really enjoy their pot roast, heaping plate of pulled pork nachos, and Smokehouse Buger. Those three dishes are pretty consistent. I've also had some dishes that were just bland to me (fish tacos and flat iron steak).  The beers are huge and always ice cold!

We started with the chicken wing appetizer which looks like a meal in itself.  It comes with the sauce on the side and a plate full of vegetables.  We really liked the flavor of the sauce it came with and the wings themselves were super crunchy.  My boyfriend had the lemongrass chili Wok entree and he liked it more than he thought he was going to.  I had the seafood pho.  It was good, but I was slightly disappointed in my own personal choice.  I wanted to try something new, but after having been craving pho for so long I should have stuck with a beef option that I know would have fully satisfied it.

I've been using natural soaps, oils, and shea butter for a few years. The soap here is raw, the shea butter is also raw the most varied I've seen, and the oils are the most exotic. The woman who works the counter is quite knowledgeable of the scents even down to the basenotes.

We sat at the table by the window and there was an overhead light that was not on when we sat. the light came on out of no where and it was so bright it was painful. So we unscrewed the bulb and an employee/owner maybe... Aggressively told us to screw the bulb back in after we had already been there for an hour with the light out. We screwed the light in and it was so uncomfortable we unscrewed it again and he yelled over the bar and his patrons to screw it back In because it was his bar and his rules.

When the food got to me the burger was cold. And not even like it had been sitting out too long. Just was Luke warm to cool. Really disappointing. Imagine making velvets cheese dip and when it starts to cool the cheese starts to clump, well that's how it was when the burger got to my table.

"Four of us met at Solaris Grille on a Sunday around 7 PM. We were seated quickly, without reservations; it wasn't crowded. This place is a casual one, with an outdoor garden cafe, and indoor seating, including a private party room. Sunday brunch is served here. By the bar, a TV blared. Our table sported real (not plastic) flowers.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers, asked our hostess for a pitcher of water, and got to work. For starters, we shared a plate of Johnny Mananas nachos ($9) without shrimp or chicken. Covered in melted Monterey Jack, with jalapenos, olives, pinto beans, guacamole, sour cream, and salsa, they turned cold and coagulated quickly. Bread (from Conshohocken, according to the hostess) was okay. We shared a plate of jumbo coconut shrimp ($10), dipped in beer batter, rolled in coconut flakes, and deep fried. The orange marmalade sauce on the side was a bit strong, but added some flavor. Not bad.  My Black Angus burger ($9), according to the menu, was ""seasoned with herbs and spices and smothered in your choice of cheese"" (I got American) but it tasted blah, a plain burger devoid of personality, unlike the shrimp. The Solar wings ($8), a dry rub, were even more depressing than the burger, the chicken flavorless and dry, the vegetables and blue cheese sauce powerless to influence us.  A friend had a drink that was tarter than expected. She let our waiter know, and got a free replacement, surprising but appreciated. In general, we had to find our waiter, and they seemed understaffed, even for an empty house. Food-wise, the shrimp were Solaris Grille's only saving grace.

"I came here with a party of 6 - around 10:30 for a late dinner. The server, was nice enough but horrible executing our table. Took about 10 minutes to get our beers (only two were ordered) and then after she dropped the food off I had to walk to the back of the restaurant an get someone's attention for the check and a to go box. I know this isn't a high end bar or grill but our bill was a little over 100 and she could've had a 25/30% tip because that's how we tip but she got a well deserved 10 dollars.

"By far the best selection in town and great service.  As for the first reviewer, they do not like to keep their humidity at 80RH, the ideal humidity for cigars is 71-72RH.  At 80 RH you would have mold on everything.  The problem is we live in a super dry climate in AB and the minute you open the door to the Humidors you let out a lot of humidity by almost 10RH or more, a walk in Humidors has to have a higher level of RH than a cabinet.  If the hygrometers read 80RH, it could be misreading or early in the morning after humidifiers have been running all night. Having said that, check out their Aficiando featured cigars that are unique to them and the Special edition cubans. Everything is in great shape, they really look after their cigars unlike most convenience style smoke shops.   By far the best in town, a must stop for USA tourists.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 5.0

"This place is a gem!  It's rare to find a place that truly cares about its customers.  I have eaten here both in this location, and the location around the corner before they grew.  They are a family-owned establishment named after their dogs, Ralph & Ava.  Speaking of that, they love it when you bring your dogs to dine outside!  Their soups are awesome.  My favorites are the creamy spinach soup and the potato soup.  The salad bar is pretty good too and includes romaine lettuce and spinach.  None of that iceberg crap.  There is always a hearty selection of entrees.  Often they get fancy schmancy cakes from Sugar Mama's (a bakery across the street).  Or indulge on a brownie sundae complete with sprinkles on top.  The beer selection is probably the best in Morgan County.  Lots of craft choices, some non-craft choices, and I think about four different beers on tap.  There is a beautiful bar to belly up to, or enjoy a cocktail at your table.  I highly recommend trying a liquid marijuana (aka liquid leprechaun).  It's green, fruity, tropical goodness!  I come here at least once a week for trivia.  If there have ever been any problems with anything, the owners have always wanted to know and have been attentive to our concerns.  That doesn't happen often, but no place is perfect.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 5.0

"This may be my go to for Chinese in the New Tampa / Wesley Chapel area.  I always go for trying my staples before venturing out too far on the menu so I tried the won ton soup, beef with broccoli, and an egg roll. All were very good. The brown sauce on the main dish was thick and savory, the meat was a good cut without any fat or chewy bits that usually ruin that dish. The egg roll may be a frozen prepped egg roll, but it still came out better than anything I can make at home.  I fed 6 people (3 adults and 3 kids) for around $35 and still have lots of leftovers so I can recommend this place for a quick and relatively inexpensive meal.  I also must note that they use my favorite to go containers which are quickly replacing my leftovers containers.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I have been shopping at Costco for as long as I can remember...  I would go with my parents when I was younger and ride the flat cart as they stocked up on food and other items that we needed and couldn't get at the stores where we lived at the time.   And the fact that you can basically eat lunch just from the samples was the best part. Even now we end up buying the stuff we sample if we love it. My kids love to walk around and try the different foods.  We prefer the meat that is offered at Costco. It seams like there is a little bit more care when it comes to quality with their meats. We also love their large muffins. They are so good and we love the ones that come through the different holidays. The apple and pumpkin ones are amazing but poppy seed and chocolate-chocolate chip are standard favs in our house.  All the staff is super friendly.

From the barely polite cashier to whoever made the sandwich, I could definitely tell not one person gave a damn. That's on management. I guess they don't give a damn either. Hell, Arby's cheesesteak is better! You'll see in the picture. The fact that the sandwich and a regular drink cost over $10 is just adding insult to injury.

"Ok, so this was my first time visiting, and as someone who prides themselves on being a local beer connoisseur, I am not entirely certain why this took me so long!  Atmosphere: I normally start with food, but I just enjoyed this atmosphere so entirely much that I'm starting here. This place has a relaxed, industrial, rustic, laid back sophistication that I haven't experienced in many other restaurants. It is the perfect juxtaposition of each of these elements.   It is family friendly- they brought out a roll of pizza dough for my kids to play with. Genius!   I had the Amber IPA (another juxtaposition really) and it was awesomely refreshing and perfectly balanced.  We also ordered breadsticks and pizza, which I must say rivaled jockamos in deliciousness, and that is saying something.   This is a great place to get a beer if your hip and cool and super edgy adult, great place to take the kids of your a khaki wearing pony tail sprouting vanilla soccer mom, great place to take your buds if you're just down to earth like good food and good drinks sort.

"Not sure why there are so many negative reviews as i had a great experience with Lenox. I wanted to get my friend Sondra S., a christmas gift that was beautiful and unique. I looked at the Lenox website because recently I had gotten some advertisements from them thru the mail... and i found Disney Christmas ornaments. They were beautiful and I could even have one personalized. Since I know she loves Disney, I decided this was the gift. I got her a Minnie Mouse ornament with her name on it, and also an older 2020 Mickey Mouse Ornament just to accompany it.   While buying these two ornaments, I bought two for myself. I got a nutcracker ornament since one of my trees is themed from that ballet, and the other was a beautiful snowflake ornament for my ice/snow themed tree.   When i got the ornaments, they were absolutely beautiful. I kept mine and then shipped the ones for my friend to her. She absolutely loved her gift! I made a friend happy!

"The Nashville Shakespeare Festival, or Shakespeare in the Park as it is known locally, is a free event held in Centennial Park every summer.  It's a great opportunity to see live performances of some of Willy Shakes' finest work, and it's a lovely place to take a date or have a picnic.  The performers stage a different production each year, and they always have a unique take on Shakespeare's classic works.  Sometimes they'll do a modern interpretation, and other times it will be closer to a conventional performance.  The actors are typically quite talented, and as long as you show a bit early you'll probably be able to get a spot near the stage.  The best thing about Shakespeare in the Park is that it usually runs for several weeks.  This year, the performers will be staging ""Coriolanus"" from August 14 through September 7 on Thursdays-Sundays.  There are usually plenty of vendors in the park, so you can get yourself a snack or some ice cream before checking out the production.  It's great for families and one of Nashville's neatest traditions.",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 5.0
"1. Of the few salvage stores in Philly, this is the only one I consider to have true architectural salvage of any mass.  The rest just have a lot of doors and small hardware and shutters.  This place has more massive pieces, whole parts of rooms or old establishments.  It is really the only go-to place in the city for shopping for salvaged construction materials for a big renovation.  Their prices are ridiculous, as many salvage places tend to be.  Par for the course.  2. The service used to be bad but I have hope.  Last weekend I had a great customer service experience looking for a vintage bathroom sink and was sort of surprised.  The guy working there seemed familiar but I couldn't place him.  Then I found out he used to work at Philadelphia Salvage.  A real loss for Philly Salvage and a real gain for Provenance.

"We ate here while on a recent trip, due to being highly recommended by the locals. They are known for their large oysters so we decided to give them a go. My husband did not want to have the oysters. They were large- which for oyster lovers, I'm sure is a big selling point!   However, they were incredibly chewy and way too cheesy to eat ""traditionally."" Had one and decided it was best to forgo another. We then ordered the shrimp pasta which allegedly came in either a tomato based sauce or a Alfredo sauce.   Our waitress was quick to take our order and seldom appeared to fill our glasses or ask how the food was. The pasta was disappointingly bland and neither of us understood the hype.   Oysters were large. Everything else in general lacked flavor. Also lacking was kindness from staff. Both our waitress and the hostess seemed stand-offish and frankly, quite rude.

"I have been going to this Superstore for a very long time.  Back in the day I shopped there exclusively for canned, packaged and prepared foods.  Their vegetables section was not very good.  Now though they have improved quite a lot across the board.  Their produce now is quite good and I like that they often have some items that are hard to find at other stores.  This place can be quite hectic on weekends and after work.  I am fortunate that I can often find time during the weekday for a shopping run if I need it.  If you can find an ""off"" time to do your shopping here you will have a much better experience.  One thing they have vastly improved on is that they have a lot of cashiers on during their busy periods.    If you have PC Financial account or MasterCard you can fill up at the gas bar and get 7 cents/litre back in grocery coupons! It's a pretty good deal if you are going to shop there afterwards.

"When I first dined here I was so confused at the 3 stars they had. But after dining here a few times it makes sense. I was brought here by a friend over 2 years ago. I got the carnitas tacos and they were phenomenal. Honestly some of the best I've had and I've been to Mexico several times. The margaritas were also great the passion fruit, guava and when in season the watermelon being my faves. The service was great and the complimentary chips and salsa didn't hurt.   I was happy to make Cantina apart of my weekly rotation from that initial experiences. However fast forward to 2 years later and tonight has solidified it for me; IM NEVER GOING BACK. So over the 2 years I've been coming here consistency has been the biggest problem. At times I would get the carnitas tacos and it would be dried out  and bland. The guacamole all too often lacks salt and the margaritas are hit or miss. Now margaritas I can definitely blame the bartenders. Some are better than others. Some bartenders put way too much sour mix or not enough of the fruit purée and yes even sometimes too much tequila and the drink isn't balanced.   In addition to the carnitas tacos I absolutely loved the garlic shrimp. The sauce it comes in reminds me of the broth you get when you order mussels (shallots, garlic,white wine a little lemon for acidity). It's absolutely divine and they give you grilled bread with it. I always order extra bread and I ALWAYS don't stop until every drop of that broth is gone. But sadly they even ruined that for me. The coconut shrimp is good very similar to the ones from red lobster.  I haven't came here in 3 months but I was hungry. Since they kitchen close at 1am and it was midnight and slim pickings for eating in the area, my cousin and I made our way here. We ordered garlic shrimp, carnitas and chorizo tacos. The carnitas tacos was dried out and bland and the guacamole was bland. Big surprise. I sent the garlic shrimp back. Instead of the beautiful opaque garlicky goodness I'm used to it, the bottom of the bowl was filled with oil that appeared to have burnt fresh garlic in it. The shrimp was cold and bland. The bread was cool but with no sauce to dip it in what's the point. I'm sorry I absolutely wasn't paying for that monstrosity. As if the mediocre food wasn't bad enough when I got the check I seen that we were charged $4 to add guacamole to each orders of tacos. The last time I was here it cost $1 to add guacamole to tacos. I was extremely pissed. The guacamole portion was barely enough for 1 taco let alone 3 and they had the nerve to raise the price. I also noticed that they tossed the price of other things such as the introduction to tequila flight. At this point I'm over it, I heard they are other great taco spots in Philadelphia and those place shall be getting my money from now on.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Although it was January, Bourbon street was nuts. Probably due to the NFC Championship game on Sunday. I moved a couple blocks out of the crowds and found 9 Roses Cafe. One night I had chicken pho and grilled beef soft bun sliders with cilantro, cucumber, pickled carrots, & daikon. I got take out and went back to the hotel. You would think that Pho is bad take out, as it is soup with delicate ingredients. However, they gave me what looked like a quart of hot broth with a large bowl of rice noodles and chicken, and a bag of basil, bean sprouts, and jalapenos. The chicken was a notch above the typical ingredients used in Asian restaurants. It was clearly fresh chicken breast pulled into chunks, and not frozen chicken lumps that were subsequently ""rethermalized."" I was impressed and enjoyed combining all the ingredients. Fresh basil in broth with hot sauce is so good. The sliders were very tasty, with fresh ingredients and a spicy sauce (on the side). I went back the next night for the chicken curry. Again, I ordered take out. It was HOT when I returned to the hotel, with more steamed vegetables (on the side) than most Asian restaurants (which seem to regard the broccoli etc. as a garnish). The curry was quite spicy, which was a nice surprise as most restaurants dumb-down the spices. Overall, I was very pleased with the low-cost, non-greasy,  elegantly spiced offerings of this uncrowded restaurant.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

The crawfish was well cooked being succulent and not gummy.   The service was very fast and they were very accommodating to myself and my party.  I dinged one star because the rest of my party ordered some gumbo dishes and were not satisfied at all. After trying their dishes myself, I second guessed my original rating. Regardless, I would like to explore their menu further next time in town, prior to giving any kind of recommendation.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Took my girlfriend here. Karyn did a good job and was very friendly. The massage was very strong and relaxing. The pedicure didn't hurt at all and Karyn did everything with a smile on her face.

"I came here for dinner with my girlfriend to celebrate a special occasion at the end of last year. One of my goals has been to visit all of the big-name restaurants in Philly, and Buddakan had been on my list for a long time. We ended up getting a very spacious table for 4 for the 2 of us, and the servers were very knowledgeable and helpful in making sure we got settled in.  Given that my last experience at a big-name Asian-style restaurant (Morimoto's) didn't go as well as I had hoped, I didn't get my hopes up too high beforehand. That being said, wow, did the food blow me away here. We shared the lobster fried rice as an appetizer...that is a gigantic plate of rice that you get served. It probably would have been enough to fill us both on a regular day, and there were definitely leftovers to be taken home. The small chunks of lobster made the fried rice taste better than the typical iteration of the dish, but that wasn't what made the meal. For entrees, we got the char grilled aged beef and the chilean sea bass. The sea bass was very buttery and well-done, and the mushrooms on the side was a very delicious addition. The beef simply blew me away, though. It may not be a steakhouse, but the tender strips of beef, marinated lightly enough to add a light soy flavor without being too salty, was pure heaven. We ended the meal with the chocolate bento box, which had delicious choices in virtually every box.  Buddakan's a lively place, and the large open area in the restaurant - compounded by the giant Buddha statue - make it feel very large and open. It's a fantastic place for a romantic dinner or for a gathering with a group of friends, but you'll definitely enjoy the food here. It did not disappoint.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Loved this place. Great addition to Midtown! So clean. Friendly staff. I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but the surprise price jump at the end lost a star. It says $40 for a mani/pedi. I know there is an up-charge to change mani to gel and French but $30 more?! I'm big on massage and the foot massage was great but only got half the hand massage due to too much talking (half my fault, maybe a third ;P) I wouldn't take away a star for that. Or for the fact that my thumb nails are both crooked because I didn't say anything. (Even though the technician saw it and shrugged it off when she mentioned it. I didn't ask her to fix it. ) this photo is over 3 weeks after my mani!!! Puppy for attention of course. My short short gel black French has stood up against gardening, bartending and toddlers. Amazing quality. So again, this place is recommended because over all this was a great experience. (I am very picky and would rather do my own nails but lack the time and need the pampering) If you can afford to pay anything for your mani and pedi you're good to go but for everyone who may be a mom or live paycheck to paycheck .. Maybe just double check on price.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 4.0

They let me know of other issues with my car and which ones are most serious and which can wait. They never tried to up-sell me or get me to make unnecessary repairs. They even fixed a hanging piece of plastic on my bumper for free! The owner even offered to give me a ride to work when my ride was late.  You can't beat the quality of the repairs and service here.

"I recently watched a tv special about Susanna Foo, her son and this restaurant and was dying to try it as Asian food is my favorite. The location is prime on Sansom, the decor is beautiful, the customer service of the staff is some of the best I've experienced and the food was delicious.   We ordered the dumpling sampler and pork belly to start, both we ate in under five minutes they were that good. The dumpling sampler was perfect to share between two people (six decent sized dumplings each). We shared the soft shell crab entree which was also a decent portion size and probably the best soft shell crab I've had. For dessert we had the pineapple upside down cake and the restaurant was nice enough to do a candle and write Happy Birthday on it for the occasion and even gifted us a small box of chocolates.   If you're thinking of taking someone here for their Birthday I highly recommend it and call ahead to let them know. I will definitely be coming back!",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 5.0

"They definitely need to work on their communication! I made an appt for an annual exam. Came in and was told I don't need an annual yet, which is fine. I still needed a rx refill though which the lady easily filled out on her computer and then asked if I wanted an std screening since I'm here and put me in a room to wait for the NP.   Now, I know this kind of screening only needs a urine sample and I wasn't told to do anything but sit here and wait. 25 mins later I come out of the room to go inquire on my wait time and some other staff person looks at my chart and says I have to be assessed in order for my rx to be filled and should be seen shortly. No one communicated this to me! In the end, I waited 50 mins to be asked two questions and the NP didn't even know I was supposed to get an std screening. She also double checked the computer to put my rx in and said it was all set.   But then!  Another note about their lack of communication.....two days later I went to the pharmacy they assigned me to pick up my rx and what do you know!  It's not in the system. Now I have to waste more time calling them back to get my rx resent to the pharmacy and hope they do it right this time.

Manny recommended to us someone who installed and laid beautiful pavers (which were hand chosen by us and Manny went out of his way to find where they could be purchased). Our entire driveway was redone and steps were added to open up our space. His prices are very fair for the quality of material and labor.

The bread was freshly baked and delicious, and was included in my order of Fahsah (stewed shredded lamb). Extra bread can also be ordered separately for $2. The stewed lamb was very tender and served bubbling hot in a clay pot that kept it warm through my entire meal. Combined with the soft, warm bread, it was an amazing combination.   The Lamb Haneeth consists of slow-roated lamb, rice, and mixed veggies. The lamb was melt-in-your-mouth tender and fell right off the bone. The veggies were beautifully seasoned and went very well with the rice and lamb. It was definitely one of the better-prepared lamb dishes I've had in a while.

"Never really heard about this restaurant, until I got invited for a bachelorette party here, a few weeks ago. I didn't order anything since we are going somewhere else for dinner, this is just a place for us to hang out, grab few drinks and gather everyone before heading out for a show. Two of my friends bought a bottle of red wine which they split and paid for right away. After we sat down and talked one of them ordered two appetizers for us to share. Before we left my friend gave her card to pay for the two appetizers, we waited for the card but it wasn't returned right away, everyone was in a hurry and we forgot about the card too. We left and watched the show, then my friend realized, she left her card at Copia.   We went back and try to get her card. To our surprise, there was an extra charge on her bill, so she nicely explained that she didn't order those. We also vowed and explained that we were there and we saw what she ordered. We waited PATIENTLY and NICELY. Reminded them multiple times that we are still waiting in one corner. After almost an hour of being ignored and was rudely answered, we just had it. They really forced us to pay it because ""her employee, swears to GOD that he is 100% sure that my friend ordered the extra wine"", and slammed the bill on the table and that we really have to pay for it. We disputed it nicely at first until they keep pushing and pushing and pushing that we really have to pay. The funny thing is the server that came out that said that we ordered from him was NOT, and again, WAS NOT THE ONE WHO SERVED US.   We told that manager that he was not the one and the server and manager was VERY RUDE to us! Maybe they're thinking we are drunk and they could get away with it, but NO. I only have one drink the entire bachelorette party and we are very sober! After over an hour of discussion, our fun night was destroyed by the rude employees of this restaurant. It turned into a very chaotic night for us.   For us everyone make mistakes, so we could have just let it go, it was just an error and if only it was handled the other way by the Copia managers and employees, it could have ended in a different way. The situation was handled poorly.   So if you all would ever want to try this restaurant, make sure you take evidence of the food and drinks you ordered, because they finally made changes on my friend's bill after we asked for them to review the camera of where we were seated and see if we really had those items that was charged extra on us. We were telling the truth and was mistreated unfairly by them. I can't even explain the craziness of how they treated us. Being told and made us feel like a liar was unacceptable!

Me and my friend made an appointment to come in for the makeover with a mandatory 60 dollar purchase deal for a night out and also so my friend could learn a couple techniques she had been wanting to do.

At the risk of sounding like a jerk, I made an appointment because I have a time frame and the other workers staffed should have been capable of helping other customers without any delegation. By the end not only was I unhappy with this, I was also unhappy with the look. She over drew my lips and the outline was really stark compared to the lipstick and didn't look like the reference picture. The only thing that resembled the picture were the eyebrows. The eyes were smoky but didn't have the color or the shimmer from the picture.   When she finished I asked for a list of the products used so I could make my 60 dollar purchase. I'd intended to buy more than that, whatever was needed to replicate the look, but that's when I was told it was NOT a 60 dollar purchase necessary for the face, the face alone was 60 dollars. I was shocked because this is not what was confirmed over the phone when we made the appointment, and not my or my friends past experience. Instead she explained it away as ""we are busy""  and also ""only the store in the mall does that."" My other friend who had made her appointment for 3:30 immediately canceled, so she didn't get the coaching she wanted and resolved to buy the products she thought she needed so me and our third party member could help her make the look. The third party member we had with us said she would hop in to fill the appointment.  I was visibly angry with the misinformation about the makeover and gently tried to protest as to not make a scene at the counter. I had intended to spend whatever the amount was for the products to get my look, which was definitely over the 60 dollars, but I was angry and left with nothing but a pretty face that wasn't what I asked for because I had to get out of there before I felt like crying from being let down. I told my friend who was waiting for the makeover that were were going to get coffee. She noticed I was very upset and on the verge of tears.  She later met us at the coffee place across the way because she had waited too long to be helped for the SCHEDULED appointment, and she had also returned the makeup she previously bought because the experience as a whole put a bad taste in her mouth. All three of us left without the experience we expected or the products we wanted based on the misinformation we were given when making our appointments.   Included is the picture reference I brought and the pictures of my face to compare.   I can't believe this happened. This was NOT the Mac experience I had at my wedding at all. I won't be making any more recommendations, trips or purchases to Mac.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 1.0

"Where do I start? We've been a fan of this Hooters for many years, sixteen years for sure.  Visit last week was the final however. We eat out frequently (about 7 meals a week) for years when the girls were little every Thursday night the eight of us (four grand parents, parents, and two girls) would meet at Hooters for dinner.  A few years ago when everyone got very busy my wife and I continued the practice.  Then things started to change.  First no French dressing for our salad.  Then the Blue cheese dressing became just a watery sloppy kind of gruel. Service got rather sporadic but seldom really bad. We cut back on our attendance substantially  but each time we went it seemed small changes had occurred that were unpleasant.. Last week was nothing exceptional except the food in total was bad.  They were out of several of the salad dressings we requested, the Blue cheese dressing was very watered down, the fries had been re-fried at least once, the wings were dried out and had been dipped several times also.   It is apparent to me that this Hooters has been sold in the last few years to someone who believes that the way to make money in this business is to skimp in the kitchen.  Let the accountants direct the activity.   I think that without a change in ownership or general manager this one is not worth the effort.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 1.0

"I have no idea why there are any positive reviews of this place! Salad was alright but the salmon ""entree"" what a joke! Smallest piece of salmon Ive EVER been served as an entree dish! Im not in any way shape or form exaggerating either! There were a few shredded pieces of zucchini and flavorless unseasoned carrot puree. I was really excited  about the spaetzle as I have rarely come across it outside of a few genuine German pubs. I normally love it but their version of this was also a big fail. Again flavorless too large of pieces of supposed ""spaetzle"" dough..well not entirely flavorless as it tasted reminiscent of cheap cooking oil but was very dry.. In order to make it edible(since i was hungry) i melted some real butter and poured it over them. I added freshly ground salt and pepper also to give everything a bit of flavor as well(if the dish is top notch and properly seasoned..this is NEVER necessary...so yah..not top notch:/) i also asked for my salmon to be cooked to medium and it was way overcooked to well done. The tiny piece of salmon was Im guessing about 2 oz maybe 2.5. That is an appetizer portion ANYWHERE else! I recommend you to instead give pretty much anywhere else a go in the area!

I've seen all types of people enjoying this place from hipsters, to punk kids, to grandmas, really.  Please note this is a smoking establishment, so that may be a turn off for some.   I really enjoyed a burger stuffed with blue cheese and bacon and also the corn fritters! There are a few other great looking stuffed burgers on the menu that I also look forward to trying. The stuffed burgers do take a little more time to prepare, so grab an appeizer while you're waiting.  Great variety of craft beers and also cheep beers. Grab a $2 PBR, or a 40 oz of King Cobra, or beers from Flat 12, Founders and more! A full bar is also available with premium bourbons, scotches, etc.  If you're seeking a joint to grab a burger and brew without any attitude from guys that really enjoy what they do, give this place a shot. This will be one of those places where lots of worlds collide, but trust me that's a good thing!  Just had to make a quick update to this review. I returned last night and had the Deutschland Damon. Wow! Seriously... who needs a reuben when you can have one of these! The Deutschland is ground corned beef, stuffed with sauerkraut and swiss cheese on a rye bun.

"I love the attitude of the stylists here--which is to say, there is none (no attitude, that is).  I'm kind of low-maintenance with my beauty rituals, but also like to look nice, as any girl does, and all the employees here are wonderful, tactful, and have never looked down their nose at me--they treat their clients with respect.  I came here for my bridal styling and makeup a year ago, as well as my bridal party did, and they treated us very well here, listened to exactly what we wanted, and did a fabulous job.  And whoever is working there and isn't wonderful doesn't belong there (there was only one woman, who I hope is no longer working there--this was a year ago--who worked at the front desk and was NOT friendly, but seemed out of place, because everyone else was friendly).  To say that stylists handle their tasks ""gracefully"" and ""wonderfully"" as Stephanie Z. says in her review of L'Etoile, is so true!  I really hope Salon L'Etoile doesn't change its wonderfulness, and that it only improves with time, like a fine wine.  All the women in my family are converts to this salon and go here--my mom, my aunt, and my sisters.  it's reasonably priced, with wonderful staff, and up on trends.

I want to start out by saying the waiter was very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately my fiancee and I went to split a chicken parm and the meat in the middle was completely raw.

"This is one of Emeril Lagasse's Restaurant serving small plates with some Asian influence flavors.  We came to Meril for lunch.  We didn't have reservations, and had no problem getting seated.  Like his original restaurant, its an open kitchen concept where you can see the goings on behind the scenes.    Ordered: the FRIED CHICKEN SALAD (highly recommend).  The salad came with three generous strips of fried chicken and was delicious.  I could have eaten another order by myself.  The chicken was fried perfectly (not greasy).  The batter was light and crispy and exactly what fried chicken should be.  The ranch dressing also isn't a typical ranch, which I really enjoyed.  The MUFFALETTA FLATBREAD (recommend).  It comes on a narrow wooden board, and it has all the toppings of a muffaletta. The crust is crispy and thin. If you like flatbread, you can't go wrong...there's not much more to say.  The CANDIED PORK RIBS (not recommended unless you like 5-spice).  The meat was soft and tender.  And although it says ""candied"" it's far from sweet.  The five spice actually over powers the entire dish and that's all I could taste, really subtracting from the dish.  The FETTUCCINE NERO (I wouldn't order again...but hey that's me).  The pasta is cooked perfectly.  There crab wasn't overabundant, nor was it lacking.  There was mainly small bits of crab, than ""jumbo lumps.""  But, the problem with this dish...is the lack of flavor.  Everything on this dish seemed muted.  There was no heat, no acid, no seasoning.  It tasted like fettuccine in butter and olive oil with pieces of crab and a lot of almond slivers.  This dish definitely needed something extra...  To drink, the Rosa Sangria was light and refreshing.  Very tasty.  I would definitely go back to Meril's for the fried chicken salad, as well as to order two items that we wanted, but unfortunately was sold out.  The Alligator Hot Sausage and the Braised Pork Belly (argo the substitutions of the candied pork ribs and the fettuccine nero.)  Overall, The space is lovely.  The food was all well cooked.

This place still gets 3 stars and can rise as high as 4 stars from time to time when the sauce isn't quite as chunky.

We arrived at this ""hole in the wall"" that I have driven past for years because of the great overall reviews.  The outside is nothing to brag about; it used to be a Long John Silvers about 20 years ago and has been many things over the years.  The inside is also nothing special.  Some of the tables are too close together so you are always bumping chairs with customers as food is passed over your head.  We ordered a TON of sushi and specialty rolls.  Because of the size of the order it took awhile.  My son that doesn't like sushi ordered the BBQ Eel and loved it (BTW).  The sushi arrived on HUGE platters and we dove in.    Everything was flavorful and was enjoyed immensely.  The rice was full of flavors that I couldn't ID.  I usually can't taste the rice, but here I could.  The portions of fish were not skimpy and the rolls had a very ""fresh"" taste to them.  The wait staff was a little slow but the place was packed.  Refills on drinks were not as quick as we would have liked either.  But she earned a fat tip because she did take great care of us when we could get her to the table.

The food came out cold and overcooked as well...nothing about the experience went well. The waitress who was helping was polite however, I feel bad for her because she got barely any assistance....MANAGMENT should be ashamed of the way the staff acted and how their managing the operation!!!

"Compared to other indian restaurants in the area, Bangles is definitely what you'd call suburban-classy. They've got pretty decor and dimmed mood lighting but hefty prices to match. We ordered the Dahi Puri appetizer, the Baluchi Murgh Tikka tandoor, and the Paneer Makhani entree. The appetizer was great, we all loved it. However, at $1 a tiny puri it didn't seem worth the price at all. Which basically seemed to be the theme of the night: good, tasty food at not-worth-it prices. The Baluchi Murgh Tikka tandoor was spicy and cooked well. The only thing we did not like at all was the Paneer Makhani which tasted like thickened tomato soup with some added paneer chunks. However, they give you a really nice sized portion of the curry/subji which I would say can be split between 2-3 people. Still pretty expensive at $14 though. The naan, however, is fantastic and worth it. If you don't mind paying a little extra for your food, then come here for a nice meal.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"This restaurant is the first Thai spot I have tried in town, and overall it was a good experience. Good atmosphere, friendly people...food was okay. Like a previous reviewer said, I don't think they are trying to deliver totally authentic Thai cuisine. I ordered the Thai Fried Rice and my husband ordered the Paht Thai. The paht thai was good but it was definitely the americanized version (I really don't like it when restaurants make it with a tomato/ketchup base). My thai fried rice was decent; I felt like it was a little lacking in flavor. I saved half and ate the rest for lunch the next day with my own fried egg on top...definetly better the second time. I also think the dishes are a little pricey but on par with restaurants in the area.   Worth the trip is you are looking for good food and atmosphere (and ice cream next door)...don't make the trip if you are looking for really authentic thai food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

The salsa was really hot, so I asked for a little mild so I could mix it. I got a side of tomato sauce ( no lie).

Used to be a good location. I don't know if corporate took over or something changed but a couple months ago things went downhill.  they revised their pharmacy hours from 24 hour pick up to closing at 10 o'clock during the week and at 5 o'clock on Saturday and Sunday. That was the main reason I came here. Hugely convenient to offer that to people. Not only did they cut back on 24 hours but have closed at 5 PM. Big mistake. Losing a ton of business as a result I'm sure.   Also inventory has not been kept up with since the change and things are either not restocked or completely out of stock regularly.   Hope they get back to Old form and rethink the pharmacy hours. I'll be going elsewhere if they don't.,Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 2.0
"February 1, 2014 Saturday - lunch 12:45 PM 2 adults  Atmosphere - 5 stars Food - 5 stars Service - 5 stars   Background - I have been waiting to go here for a long time.   Atmosphere - A small place in an old building.  Wood is everywhere, making for a warm feel.  The tables are very close to each other so it is hard not to talk to your neighbors about the food, which to me just adds to the charm of the place.  When we walked in there were only two other tables were being used and one person at the bar.  I was actually surprised that the place was so empty.  When we left the place was packed, which was what I expected when we got there.    Food   Drinks - Just water for me.  They give you a carafe of water for your mason jar also known as your water glass.    Appetizer - skipped this.    My Main Course - You had me at elk, yeah I went there with a Jerry MaGuire reference.  I had the Elk burger.  I have never had an elk burger before.  I asked what the chef recommend when I was asked what his preference was how to cook the burger.  It was finely ground and the burger had a texture like a sausage patty.   Gruyere for the cheese on the burger, I love how this cheese melts and clings to things.    Dessert - stuffed with quality food.  Service - Our waiter worked his butt off as he had the entire front of the house and was the bartender for most of our time we were there.      Future - Please please please I want to come back!",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 5.0
"The food was just ok. I started with the lobster bisque (which ended up being the best thing), and it was good; creamy with a hint of spice. The entree however was really disappointing. The filet mignon was overcooked (asked for medium rare but received medium), and was lukewarm verging on cold when it came out. The lobster tail was also disappointing considering it rendered a pretty significant upcharge. The desserts were okay, too; I liked the carrot cake, but the fruit with chantilly cream was a) a tiny portion and b) literally a few berries with whipped cream on top. Definitely not something I'd pay $13 for. Overall, the service was good and I had a good time given that I was there with my boyfriend, but I don't think I would return given the quality of the food and the high prices.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 3.0
"My fiance and I had a great time at The Saint James. We were greeted with a smile and promptly seated for our reservation. The restaurant was busy, but not crowded. As more people arrived, the noise level did increase. Our waitress, Sara, told us that the owners recognize that the restaurant is loud and are working on the acoustics. It was not any louder than many of the best Center City restaurants.   Our waitress, Sara, was very friendly and had a good sense of humor. We were brought water and bread right away. The bread was amazing! It kind of tasted like a delicious soft, buttery, pretzel. She came around with water exactly when we needed a refill.  We ordered the meatball flatbread as an appetizer. It was very good. The bread is quite flat and thin, but the meatballs made up for that. A good appetizer for two people.  My fiance had the brisket and gnocchi. His dish was extremely flavorful and the portion size was good - not too big or too small.   I had the cheeseburger. My burger was delicious! I ordered it medium, but it came out medium-well. It was still super juicy and delicious though, so I did not complain about it. The fries that came with the burger were good, but nothing special. I think that someone previously noted that the fries tasted like McDonalds fries... and they kind of did... but who doesn't love McDonalds fries??? I think they could improve these a little with some kind of seasoning.   The decor of the restaurant was very nice. Simple and classic. The atmosphere was not stuffy, and the service was great. We will come back again.   The prior yelp reviews do not do The Saint James justice. It is undeniable that there may have been some issues when the restaurant first opened, but that is to be expected. All of the specials are now available, on their corresponding night of the week.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

The food was nicely packaged such that it was nice and  hot even after i got home 25 minutes later.

"We decided to try this place on a whim, based on other Yelp reviews. I was pretty happy with what we found. We started out with an order of edamame and Taiwanese salt baked chicken. The edamame come out hot, and are well salted. Pretty standard. The salt baked chicken was  excellent. Large portion, so even if you're hungry, you can share.   I had a spicy pork ramen for my main, and it was one of the best bowls of ramen I've had in a long time. Good bit of spice, but not so hot that it's overwhelming. Great flavor to the broth. The pork was delicious and tender, and the noodles were plentiful and good. My wife ordered the teriyaki box, and was unimpressed. The chicken was very dry, and the teriyaki sauce tasted like it was from a jar. Everything else in the box was good though.  All in all, I thought Bubblefish was a home run. My wife would probably try something different, and stay away from the teriyaki box.  I'd definitely go back again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Not all bad but not a stand out either.  That sums up my experience with the relatively new Shake Shack on Fashion Center Blvd., near the Christiana Mall. The location is prime near all of the brand new shopping establishments and there is ample parking.  The inside is casual but a step up from other fast food restaurants. If you have never been to a Shake Shack, know that the menu is tailored and there isn't a wide variety of sides or a ton of crazy ice cream flavors. That being said, as I vegetarian I LOVED the shroom burger option and the veggie dog option. I chose the Shroom Burger and it was very flavorful and unique!   Dining here comes with a higher price tag than other fast food options and for that reason some things should be elevated and stand out in comparison. While the service was fair and adequate, it would be nice if the staff explained or asked if patrons want things like lettuce, tomato & condiments on the burgers. Higher customer service would be go a long way in differentiating between lower priced options. All of our food was not hot/warm, the fries were mediocre but could have tasted better if they were served warm. The drinks did not all have adequate ice. These are the simple things that are easy fixes.  My meat eating dining companions all agreed that the burgers had great flavor and in comparison to other burger joints, they didn't notice a huge difference in size. The burgers and concretes come in single or double options.  Shakes and fries come in one size only.  The portions compared to the prices are not great.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Wegmans will forever be my favorite grocery store. I appreciate the company as a whole and commend them on their corporate philosophy. They were voted one of the top companies to work for and it shows.   This location is great. It is attached to the Montgomeryville Mall, so there is lots of parking. It has most of the departments you would find in the average Wegmans, besides a beer shop.  I have noticed that this location never seems to be too crowded, which is a plus for me. I have been to other locations where you can barely navigate the store with a cart because it was so crowded. I have never had that experience at the Montgomeryille location.  The food is always very fresh here. They have a wide variety of regular, organic and locally grown produce. They also have a section for gluten free foods, which makes shopping easier for those with a gluten intolerance.   The staff is great, as you will find at most Wegmans. They are constantly restocking the shelves and are helpful when you ask questions.  Wegmans can be a little pricey as compared to other grocery stores, but for the quality it really is worth it.

"I have heard mixed reviews about this place so I was a little hesitant to try it, but a friend invited me so... We went for lunch and our service was great. He was very on top of things, kept our drinks refilled, made suggestions, etc. I ordered the shrimp steamer basket. When I asked how hot a 3 was (the scale is 1-5), he told me that it was habanero. So, I ordered garlic with a 3. Well, the garlic flavor was definitely there and good but there was almost no spice at all. I am not sure if this is normal or if I just got a really mild batch. The shrimp was slightly overcooked, but that is easy to do in these steamer bags. The corn was way overcooked, but the potatoes were good. My friend ordered a crabcake and was slightly disappointed. She said the flavor was good but the crust was really thick and it was fried, which she did not expect. It was close to $40 for my basket, corn, potatoes, and a drink with the tip, so it is definitely not a cheap lunch.

"My wife and I went to Doghouse on Monday night. We both ordered the doghouse burger and sweet potato fries. When we walked in I was surprised to see how uncomfortably empty this place was. I must say the guys who work at Doghouse go over the top when it comes to customer service. They were extremely friendly! Now for a place that refers to itself as ""gourmet"" they did not impress me when it came to the burger. Gourmet would imply to me the use of gourmet cheeses, brioche bun or gourmet toppings. No ""gourmet"" factor to the burger!  The burger was thick and juicy, and the bun was good. Overall the burger didn't impress me. The burgers on the menu all seemed similar. The sweet potato fries were good. Some of the sweet potato fries were too thick, mushy and not appealing. I know comparing this place to Five Guys would not be fair because they are two very different style burger joints.

It started with the waitress flinging the menus on the table then walking off without saying anything...not I'll be right back, not welcome to Pizza Florence, not can I get you something to drink. The woman sitting at the next table looked at me and laughed as I watched the waitress walk away and said the same thing had just happened to them. We ordered an appetizer and a pizza and she brought both out at the same time. Apparently she doesn't get that appetizers should come out before the entree. The marinara sauce that was brought out with the appetizer was ice cold so we asked for another one that's been warmed up. The 2nd one came out just as cold as the 1st one. Not once did she check on us. Anytime we needed a refill on our drinks we had to track her down.

"My husband and I were regulars at this restaurant many years ago.  Loved the bartenders who learned our names immediately and were always welcoming.  The owners on the other hand made no attempt to get to know us and were as friendly to us after many many visits as they were at our first visit.  In other words...not at all !!!  My husband decided that he could not frequent a restaurant who treated their regulars like that and would not return.  I will say though, that they had regulars that they did fawn all over, but for whatever reason I guess we just never measured up.  This weekend, my sister was in town and we decided to eat there.  We asked to be seated at a booth and made it clear to our waiter that we were not in a rush and would be taking our time.  We ordered a drink and were in the middle of our appetizer when we had a friend call and ask if they could come over and join us.  As soon as our waiter found out we had another guest coming, the owner was at our table telling us very rudely that we are not allowed to do that and he does not seat tables until all guests have arrived and we were totally ruining the flow of his restaurant.  Keep in mind that we had not even order our main course yet.  At that point we asked for our check and left, but not before his wife came over to also ask if we had a third person joining us, as I anticipate she too was going to tell us this was not acceptable.  My sister and I both made a point of telling the owner in front of all the waiting guests that we have never been treated so poorly in a restaurant before .  He then tells us that ""he had no idea what was going on"" whatever that means.  Very strange couple.  Do not understand how you treat paying customers like that.

What do you have to lose by eating a massive amount of food and drinking your friends under the table besides your dignity? Nothing, that's what.

We'd had a bad experience with an Arby's -- drive up employees with no gloves, no masks, lots of touching of our food containers. Well, this Chick FilA off Ina was the safest most comforting fast food yet. Getting in the very busy double lines for drive thru we were greeted by a friendly, masked, gloved, sunglasses young man with a tablet who shared a paper menu and took our order for deluxe sandwiches and drinks. I only had to slide my card in his machine. No touching. We were then directed by another fully protected worker whose sole job was keeping cars merging into one line for the protected expediter who posed for a picture as we turned the corner. Still another fully protected worker brought us a tray with our order, which she held close to the window as I lifted each bag and drink into our car. As an over 70 cancer patient I deeply appreciated the Chick filA concern for their workers as well as my safety. Great job. I hope all the other fast food places take note .

"I don't get all the great reviews of this place.  It's just okay....at least for breakfast, which is all we tried.  This place has zero ambiance; it's just an ordinary, generic room that has no personality.  There is no outdoor seating either.  The food was so ordinary, no better or worse than a hotel coffee shop.  I had the eggs benedict and it almost turned me off on benedict for a bit.  The sauce was heavy and bland and they topped it with dried herbs.  If you're going to put herbs on top, please use fresh.  The big flakes of dried herbs on a benedict doesn't not work, and kept getting caught in the back of my throat.   The potatoes were pretty good and the fruit was fresh, though heavy on sliced banana.  If you want a great breakfast, do yourself a favor and go down the street about a block to Jeannine's American Bakery....SO much better, both food and atmosphere!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"If you are truly trying to get a feel for New Orleans, particularly the French Quarter, then the Olivier House is the place to go. The location is perfect. (One block from Bourbon st. so you can escape the noise but remain close to the action). Great food locations within easy walking distance.    The service from the staff is among the best I have ever had. Sometimes I wondered when any of them had time to sleep!  The Hotel itself is the most impressive part. It has a beautiful yet typical French Quarter exterior, and a confusing yet enchanting interior. Each room is unique, so no stay should be the same. The rooms were easy to cool down, elegant yet comfortable.   I will not even look at other locations the next time I come to New Orleans.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 5.0
BLUF:  Fancy mexican food.  Not bad.    The atmosphere is a little on the business young professional side; felt a little stuffy for mexican food in my opinion.  Service was fine but ate at the bar.  I'm an idiot and got chicken mole enchilladas and I don't care too much for mole.  It was good but the mole overpowers everything and that is all you can taste.  Good mole I guess.

"A good find for the price! A lot of nail salons around the area are pricey, which is ok but for me i needed something cheap and fast. I sucked it up and went here because i know it's not as busy. I'm glad i came here! First off, they had a sale on their spa pedis! It was 5 dollars off and i got a whole spa experience and it felt amazing! The man who worked on me and the lady who worked on my mother where very kind and made sure we were comfortable the entire time. They offered gel, but i politely declined because like i said, i just needed fast and cheap service. But the quality and experience was amazing for the price i paid.  The place was rather clean, but could use a makeover lol. It's a little outdated but the large t.v's gave my mother and i something to do! In sanitary standards, it was good!

"So we were in the Society Hill neighborhood again last night and my wife suggested that we give Stella another try. My experience was a little better this time, perhaps because I knew what to expect from the crust: well-above average American style doughy crust (a different creature all-together from true Italian style crust, which I was hoping for on our first visit).  This time I had the Piccante (spicy ham) and my wife had the Tartuffo (truffle and egg). I have to say, both were very tasty. The Piccante was indeed delightfully piccante and the egg/truffle pizza brought some serious rich, creamy, earthy deliciousness. The quality of the ingredients and my adjusted expectations, along with the general friendliness of our server, and a cheap yet decent glass of table wine led me to upgrade my rating to 4 stars.  As long as there's not much of a wait and you can walk right in, I'd say this place is worth a visit.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"3.5/5  This buffet is one of the better buffets in Reno but unfortunately, we came during the day where they didn't have their seafood out.   We came on a Monday around 12pm. It was $18.99 per person and if you have a senior over 55, you can get 10% off. We waited in a line to pay and then waited in the waiting area until we could be seated.   We were sat after probably 15 minutes after we paid. Personally looking at the buffet, there weren't that many options I was interested in. I always go for their shrimp cocktail, and bless that they were already peeled and deveined. Their Mongolian bbq bar was pretty good but the beef wasn't your typical thin sliced beef. It was more like small cubes of meat. Their pork bbq bao was lacking its signature color. It's slightly similar to the taste but the filling was very mushy.   The dessert bar is always my favorite part of this buffet. It's decked out in all desserts imaginable. Their ice-cream was amazing. I had their mint chocolate, passionfruit, and strawberry. Slightly a little too sweet but still very delicious. Chocolate macaroon was bomb. Fruit tart was decent. If I wasn't too full, I would've gotten more desserts. Delicious.    I would like to thank our waiter Ebi for being a great waiter. He always came to check up on us and provide us exactly with what we needed. We were a party of seven and he never forgot a single item. He always made sure to let us know if we needed anything, he would get it for us.   Hopefully, if we aren't in a rush next time, we can come back during their steak and seafood buffet!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

This will be the most memorable meal during my last visit to NOLA. Every part of my meal was exceptional. The dish I still savor was called the chocolate bomb. I don't see it on the current dessert menu and hope it's just an oversight on my part. This was the most delightful dessert I've ever eaten. The whipped cream was salted caramel and it caught me totally by surprise.

"'Per person' on the bumper cars at $5 each means $10 for a smaller kid to get to ride the bumber cars? Scam! Shame! And Greed!! Atmosphere is nice, food extremely expansive ($6 for a normal hotdog, $13 for something that you would expect to find at a fair; least expensive item we found was $4 for a single churro!). After finally cooling off and trying just to relax and have a nice evening with my 2 boys, the evening ends as the fair is closing and we are on the last ride of the large ferris wheel...and how does our evening end? 1 ride to the top, a pause, and then down to unload. As ALL riders complained, the response was 'that was 3 times around, we're done, it's over'. Total BS...We can all count. And this to save the workers what? They get off 2 minutes earlier, but end the evening for many guests like this?

It seemed a good idea to start with, but the bread was a bit soggy (from the ""au jus""?) and the roast beef could have been a bit more tender.  Would I go back here for the food? Oh heck no.

"I really struggled to decide between 3 and 4 stars, so I'm giving them 3.5 in my book.  Service was better than last time. We were seated by the bar, and Amber was our awesome waitress. We got our drinks and appetizer pretty fast. For being super empty for lunch on weekday, I thought it took awhile for our entrees, but at least we know it's fresh.  We started with Scallops & Polenta. This was the star of our meal. Scallops were cooked perfect and polenta was creamy. But the bacon jam on top was stellar and is what makes this dish a standout.  As for entrees, I ordered the salmon with potatoes and veggies. The salmon was quite sweet. I felt like there needed to be a better balance between sweet and savory, or even spicy. It just tasted like they cooked the salmon and put maple syrup on top. I added salt and pepper and it was better. The mashed potatoes were flavorful, but the zucchini also needed salt and pepper. I usually never add salt at restaurants or at home, so it really needed more seasoning.  My husband ordered the Chicken Flamestone. It has feta, artichokes, and sundried tomatoes. My complaint here is that the artichokes were very vinegary. It should have melded better with the rest of the flavors. Just don't use marinated artichokes, and the dish will be fantastic.  Lastly, this is my second trip to Flamestone where they did not have carrot cake available. Must be popular, but I sadly won't be able to tell you.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 3.0

"I stayed at this hotel for the Outback Bowl. And boy, I wish I would've just stayed in the pirate ship inside Raymond James Stadium. Saying this hotel was just downright awful would be a huge understatement.   First off, the hallways smelled awful, and so did my room at times. But that's just the beginning of my extreme displeasure with my room. The bathroom was just downright dirty, as there was something very disgusting beneath the sink. On top of that, the shower always gave me problems. Either the shower didn't have enough water pressure to start, or if it did, the water was either too cold or too hot. And on top of that, the towels were very dirty.   Then onto the whole room part. On so many occasions, I had to go down to the front desk to get me electronic key reset because the key continued not to read through the lock. And they didn't even ask me for any form of identification when I asked to reset my key. That made me very worried about the state of my belongings because of how easy it was to ask to have a room key reset. In addition to a bad smell, my room was also very cold on some occasions. Nobody even bothered to make my bed or to replace the towels the first day I was there. And there was a hole in the middle of the head in my bed.   Breakfast was extremely subpar. The water and orange juice machines did not work both days I was there, and then, there were no hot breakfast items likes eggs and sausages. The only items were cereal toast and some pastries. Just not a lot of options for breakfast.   If I ever come back to Tampa, I would much rather sleep at the stadium then this hotel.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 1.0

"Hands down the tastiest and most satisfying food I have had since being in St Pete! Had dinner at Callaloo last night with my mom, sister in law and little niece. We started with the Lobster MAC and Cheese... amazing. Rich and creamy with large chunks of Lobster. Afterwards my mom ordered the slow roasted pot roast, I had the sweet peach and onion barbecue ribs and my sis had the southern smoked pasta. The meat was falling of the ribs tender and the sauce was perfectly balanced between sweet and savory. Everything else was delicious as well. The sauce in the pasta was super rich and creamy.... you could tell the butter was not used sparingly. We all shared our entrees to get a taste of each. The evening ended with southern style peach cobbler, which means it's made with a biscuit dough like my grandma used to make. The service was excellent and the cocktails were scrumptious.

"One of my favorite restaurants in New Orleans. If you are a seafood lover, the ""ocean sauce"" will not disappoint (whether it's covering fish or steak!!!). I am usually not a big fan of marinara sauce, but I tried my friend's chicken in marinara and the sauce was the real deal. Very yummy! The staff is friendly and knowledgeable too. It's worth the wait for a table.  Tips:  - Cash only. - Get there earlier & put your name in (no reservations), and then go have a drink at the downstairs bar (can get crowded). - As everyone said the ocean sauce is deee-licious, but the marinara sauce is legit too if you're not into seafood. - Seafood, steak or chicken - didn't matter - everyone was happy. - Warning: As many places in NOLA, the bathrooms can get gross (later into the evening).

"As a child, I've always enjoyed Publix (for the free cookie from the deli) and this location is no different. Yesterday, I ventured into the deli area to take advantage of one of their mouthwatering selections. I settled upon a spinach wrap. The same wrap that was recommend by a Publix employee, weeks prior: spinach wrap with lemon pepper chicken, cucumbers, spinach, carrots, and feta cheese. It is now my favorite wrap. The lady at the deli was not familiar with the lemon pepper chicken wrap but I have the same reaction at most Publix stores, no biggie. And even though the employee had to run all over the store (literally) to get the ingredients for the wrap, not once did she lose her smile. I really appreciate that. Her kindness throughout my experience was exceptional.   This store encumbers all the attributes of the traditional Publix brand: friendly, clean, competitive prices, fresh ingredients (deli, produce, seafood, and bakery), and outstanding customer service. My favorites: the deli for the yummy subs/wraps, and the seafood dept for the fresh selections. Everything at Publix is Fresh, Fresh, Fresh!  No other grocery store offers to take your groceries to your car. And most want you to check yourself out and/or pay for your own grocery bags. Not Publix! This visit was strictly for a wrap but whenever I go grocery shopping, the fresh scents from the bakery and the ambiance always reminds me why I always trust Publix for my grocery shopping needs.   Recommendations:  Going after 5pm io avoid the crowds. It is very busy during the day. Lemon pepper chicken wrap (as described above).",Business Category: Grocery,Review Stars: 4.0
"I kept seeing this place when I went to Value Village, and kept telling myself I would make it in there one day. Several months ago, I made the plunge for lunch, and have never regretted it.   I love anything culinary from the Mediterranean, whether it's Italian, Greek, Lebanese, North African, Southern French, tapas, you name it. I'm convinced my body chemistry at this point is half olive oil.   Want a little taste of heaven, friends? You must try Al Salam. When you enter, the sit down restaurant is on the left, and the take out area is on the right. I wasn't sure how things worked when I first got here, so look like a pro and just sit down, and your lovely waitress will bring you a menu if you want to eat in. The space is nice and bright, surrounded on several sides by windows, and you can watch Al Jazeera on the TV. When I was there last, it was their version of The Newlywed Game.   The wafting smell of freshly baked pitas is enough to drive a girl mad, I tell you. Mad! the ovens in the back stay busy churning out pitas, and they bring the puffy little rascals to your table all hot and ready to eat with whatever you order. Biting into one is like having a little party in your mouth.  The usual standards are there-- wonderfully seasoned and juicy shish, schwarmas, Baba Ghanouj, fattoush salad (with what looked like sumac on top- nice authentic touch), hummus, and a yogurt sauce. The pickled little whatevers that come with it are yummy. I want the recipe!  The right side also has a nifty Mediterranean market, with all sorts of products you might need to duplicate some of these recipes at home, so I have purchased some interesting items there as well.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

At Mettera, there was lots to like. The hotel itself is very classy and modern, and the rooms are spacious, clean, and have all the amenities you'd want for a comfy business trip. The bed was dreamy, with tons of pillows to choose from. There's a work desk with a snazzy ergonomic chair. Loved the big bathroom with extra large towels and robes. These little luxurious make it easy not to miss home.   They offer a complimentary breakfast buffet til 9am & wine hour each evening. I missed both of these perks, but it definitely adds value to the $200-ish/ night rate.   The location is both a blessing and a curse. There's a reason they give you earbuds that read ""say no to Whyte noise."" By day, Whyte Ave is a charming strip of little boutiques and restaurants. By night, Whyte is Edmonton's party neighborhood, and Thursday is the rowdy warm-up for Friday nights on Whyte and the noise ordinance doesn't kick in until 3am (whaaaaat?!) So, if you're staying on a Monday - Weds, you won't notice a thing. But on weekend nights, those earbuds are crucial.

This is the place to take a date, meet friends, go with a group or just sit at the bar and eat.   The prices and portions are just what your wallet and palate ordered.  This is a very trendy, cool busy, noisy joint.  The bar menu couldn't be better and they have some great drink specials, the food menu covers the spectrum from seafood to meats.  The prices are very reasonable (for such a trendy spot), the portions are filling (don't expect to take a doggie bag home) and the flavors are wonderful.  Our table had nice/wine, great/vodka martinis, filet mignon was a perfect selection of beef & well cooked, the K-Bobs were size able and my tuna was fresh and cooked perfect w/a very flavorful sauce.  the salads were crisp & fresh and the starches were nice.  Desert was delicious (mounds jar & apple crisp).  If you want a nice dinner out in the upscale (!) Bellair Bluffs then head over to Marlin Darlin...you going to love it.  Prices are right!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Yes my friends - Mt Lemmon is high enough (9157 ft) to be graced with snow now and again - and there is a sweet ski lift to access the top of the slopes.  And it remains open during the hotter months to serve as a cool ride over the mountain!! I felt like I was in Switzerland - and was almost expecting to see Heidi running bare-footed under my seat...

The wait isn't long. There are no waiters so your on your own for any alcoholic beverages. You have to go to the at with as many ID's as you want drinks. 1ID=1drink.i had ribs, mac&cheese, fried corn and loaded fries. Ribs were dry, Mac lacked flavor, corn was ok. Now the loaded fries, off the chain. Absolutely amazing.

"When I didn't think Cajun cuisine could get any better, I dined at Emeril's and had a great meal to end my trip in New Orleans.  I opted out of the entree and elected to order two medium plates and a side of gumbo.  The rabbit crepes and lamb meatballs were a hit, despite not realizing that the latter was actually the former and vice versa.  Additionally, the presentation was well-executed - the dishes for the entire party arrived at once and was complimented by an assortment of specialty bread and wine.    My first impression when I walked in was that I was dinning in someone's home in the South.

"Our first time staying here and have to say probably the best hotel I've ever been to. We stayed overnight as we were heading to adventure aquarium the next day. The place is spotless, each and every staff member were very polite. The breakfast had a huge variety of foods. Kitchen staff were constantly filling up the items. My 12 year old loved the pool there,  it was clean and he even met some new friends while swimming. I like how the pool hours are until 11:00 pm since most places the pool closes by 9:00pm (even though he was done swimming at 7:00) it is still a nice convenience if we did want to swim later. There is a variety of snacks and health and beauty items to purchase 24/7 if you need them along with soda machines on the floors.

"Wow! I've now been here about 6 times total and I can say this place is amazing. First couple times I tried their pizza which was very good. I would say that the plain cheese pie is a 4/5, but the pizza with toppings and buffalo chicken I had was a 5/5. To be honest I rarely explore the dinner menus at ""pizzeria's"" as I usually stick to the pizza, however reading previous reviews I just had to. I must say that this place has THE BEST Italian dinners!!! I've had the stuffed chicken (special order not on menu *pic on yelp), the crab raviolis and vodka rigatoni. I've been to expensive Italian restaurants that aren't nearly as good as this local pizzeria. They must use top notch ingredients. Those 3 dinners I mentioned all came with hot out of the oven bread and a good soup. I would've expected just a bread that was fresh a couple days ago and just toasted like other shops include. I look forward to exploring the menu more often. This place has now become my local fave. I'm glad that I noticed it when I was headed in to breakfast at Maryanne's right next door a few months back.

"What a disappointing experience . Pulled off the 101 freeway to specifically eat here and one of the ladies with grey hair was so rude to me I'm writing this review immediately. We had the delicious smoked turkey & cranberry and brie sandwich which includes a cranberry fig  confit while I was waiting for my sandwich i was browsing for some of their imported items and the same lady was following me around as if i was going to steal something . I told her ""no I was browsing,  they carry items I can't get locally or from Sur La Table"". When i brought the selections to the counter and asked her to help me open my Twist off soda with the bottle opener hanging there specifically for that purpose she looked at me as if wtf?  So now I'm explaining i have bad hands and twist-offs aren't easy for me . I get outside get a table for my man & I . I re-entered the store and asked for a side of cranberry-fig confit . Don't know what she said because she muttered it under her breathe  then went behind the counter and proceeded to mock/make fun of the way I said 'confit' to the others who were making  sandwiches and several of them joined in making fun of how i said ""confit"".  So here's more explaining , I have a slight speech impediment and wearing a mask sure doesn't make it any easier . Lady you & your staff  need some serious sensitivity training. I'm far from a thief so you certainly don't have to follow me around your precious grocery store . Next time you & your crew decide to mock/make fun of a disabled customer you might want to think about it . Disabled people yelp and have a right to make an ADA complaint .

"We came here on a groupon deal and left pretty disappointed. While the servers were nice enough the service was very very slow. They looked busy so not sure if they were just understaffed (two servers and manager (?) bringing out the food) but it took at least 5 mins to get our first drink and then after our first drink they didn't come back to ask if we wanted another drink even though we stayed for appetizers and dinner. When we asked one of the bartenders for our bill he told us that he wasn't our server so we need to ask the other bartender. Another 10mins goes by until we finally waved her down (not sure why the other bartender could have just gone to the same computer and grabbed the bill). The whole time we were sitting at the bar there was a tray of dirty dishes and left over food behind the bar that was completely untouched for the 1.5 hours we were there.  Finally when we submitted our $60 groupon only $56.75 came off our bill and the only explanation we got is ""I don't know why it does that but that what the computer does"" (so basically too bad for us).   The perogy nachos, sweet potatoes fries and mushroom soup were very good, while the chicken California burger was a bit salty (good amount of avocado though).  In the end the food was pretty good but wouldn't come back because of the service.

"Absolutely terrible experience. The sales associate tried to tell me all they carry is what is in style and if I don't like their frames then I'm out of style (but way better options, including many frames I actually liked, can be found at Trend Eye Care in Northern Liberties. Trend Eye will also treat you better for a better customer service experience). She was also incredibly condescending. They take a very limited option of vision insurance making it difficult to have your glasses covered. And finally they told me the wait for the glasses would be 1-2 weeks (Trend Eye it took just 2 days).  Stay away from this place unless you want to pay more out of pocket for a severely limited frame selection and a terrible shopping and customer service experience where you get insulted and forced to wait an unnecessarily long time for your merchandise.   EDIT: I'm responding to your response Chris. I'm not surprised by it since you seem to always respond with hostility to bad reviews.  It's not that I don't like you. The problem is I didn't like the way your store associate treated me.  I never said you were rude to your customers. I said the customer service representative was condescending and tried to tell me that your store only carries what is in style, and if I don't like any of your frames, I must be out of style. I didn't make that up; my girlfriend witnessed it too. I ran my review of your store by her since she was there and she agreed with what I said. Both she and I are not ones to try to hurt someone's business. (Just look at my other reviews)  The funny thing here is your terrible customer service continues as you can't take ownership of the fact that your store associate was terrible in making me feel uncomfortable about my options and my shopping experience. You should apologize and say you'll try to remedy the situation and prevent it from happening again. I don't know if you're the store manager or just the social media associate, but either way you are proving here how terrible you are at customer service. My only regret about this review, is I can't give you 0 stars.  2nd EDIT: if you're truly sorry and taking it so seriously, then STOP writing this off as someone making a joke, or her simply rubbing me the wrong way. I know what I heard her say, and my girlfriend was there to witness it. If it was meant as a joke, it was highly inappropriate and not funny. Nobody laughed or smiled, including your associate.  I appreciate your apology, but it seems you're apologizing for the wrong reasons.  I'm currently by chance at another business where I am quite friendly with the staff, and showed them your response. They are as shocked as I am. At this point my only hope is that you learn to correct your behavior by the time this review is ""buried"" behind other better ones, so that you don't treat more customers like this. I'm not going to respond anymore. But I wish you and your business and employees well, and I'll hope you all learn some humility and how to treat people better than this.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 1.0

"I dined here recently with a huge party of 14 or 16 . . . as you can imagine, disaster resulted.  *tear I forgot to mention in my last review, but there's a corkage fee for your BYOB, i think $3 per bottle of wine and then $.50 per bottle/can of beer - LAME!  So you don't want to pay for a bar license, but you want to charge your customers money for their desire to have a simple glass of wine, they bought, at your restaurant?  I know this is protocol at many places, but still! So our large group was here for a birthday.  They were able to seat us, but did so in tiers (understandably) as we arrived at different times. The waiter was not very devoted to us, at all.  I suppose he assumed we would be difficult or take forever to order, but he circled us several times - servicing the people around us, but never even paused to ask us if we were ready (we were ready to order at least 25 minutes until he finally came to take our orders). I understand it was Saturday night and they were busy anyway, but they couldn't get it together with regards to ensuring we all received our food in edible condition.  I ordered the Garlic Tofu and by the time it reached its optimal devouring position in front of me, it was pretty cool, no steamy hotness or warmth to it.  Additionally I ordered it HOT and it was completely not spicy at all. At least I received my food.  Two people in our party never received their Chef Special's - some fish entree.  So the poor souls ended up picking at the other people's plates.  Nearly thirty to forty minutes elapsed and one of them decided to inform the waiter (as he paused by our table) that they were no longer interested in their entrees, being that we were all gearing up to go for some birthday celebratory drinks. Now this part was annoying!  The waiter INSISTED, the entrees were about to be ready in five minutes and we just needed to bear with him because the kitchen was swamped and the dishes were already being prepared so could we just be patient.  Uh . . . what? So one of the people who didn't receive their fish entrees, decided to actually pursue our waiter and firmly explain to him that the rest of the 14 people were ready to go AND it was nearly closing time.  He finally agreed to cancel out the fish entrees, but begrudgingly.  I assume he did, we never really checked the bill since we were so rushed to leave.  So yeah, was not really pleased about that whole shebang, but I still like their food above all the other Thai places.  Anyway, that's that!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

The room had a small musty smell, but nothing febreeze didn't cure. The room was spotless and cleaned very well each and every day. My only gripe is that they over charged me, twice. This was mostly because a new employee was being trained (same person whoe overcharged me both times). Since it was a weekend when this occurred I didn't recover my funds until Monday.

"We came in as those asshole 20 minutes before close. Which was kind of a shock to me being most resturants in this area stay open later in the Summer because of how much business they get being close by the River. Anyways that was not the case, so we asked if it would be okay because honestly I was ready to head fast to Bardenay! But they said yes and my husband was persistent.   We did not get horrible service for the circumstance. Some white lady was singing Proud Mary which was weird being it is Asian Cuisine but I ignored the weirdness. Our server... Tim? He was good. I was a little annoyed he said we had to ""order"" by nine. Most places sit up until their closing time. To each their own but what annoyed me the most was this heavy set white lady (possible  busser) storming around with a pissed off look on her face and slamming things around while yelling at other people. That ruined the vibe for me.  We managed to squeeze in an appetizer and meals before nine. The flavor of the lettuce wraps is good but the portion size was way too small. I am dieting and ordered a mojito chicken dish. The chicken was crying for salt. I ate it all but it was so bland. I thought maybe because it was a healthy dish but I trief my son's chow mein with chicken and it tasted bland as well. The vegetables tasted frozen and equally flavorless. However the chow mein noodles were so flavorful I think it pushed my review rating to a three.  My husband's ribeye tasted really good and he said the food was great.

"We kept hearing about this place and finally gave it a try. We placed our order online for a 3:30 pickup. They were 20 minutes late.   We ordered the Pad Thai which was one of their signature dishes. We got an enormous amount of it. Like more than two people would eat. Pretty nice for $15. Sadly, it didn't really taste like much of anything. The chicken was very overcooked and everyone was pretty plain. I think more sauce and less noodles would have helped. It was unremarkable in ever way.  We also got General Tso's Chicken. It was sort of the opposite. Didn't fill the container even half way but had a lot of sauce.  (See the picture.) The taste was OK, but most General's are breaded and fried. This was not and was pretty uninspiring. The jasmine rice was fresh and tasty.  We also got Shrimp Fried Rice which was very good, at least. Also a very large serving. To start we got the dumpling platter appetizer. All were pretty unremarkable and the sauce was iffy.

"I felt a distinct coldness on the part of the owner for being a Groupon user, starting with making the appointment. There were NO available appointments for six weeks when I tried scheduling a facial + massage or just a facial or just a massage online saying I had a Groupon.  When I deselected the ""Groupon User"" check box, however, I was able to make an appointment for the facial within two weeks, so I took it. I was disappointed I had to break up the two services, however. My Groupon included a facial and massage, but I couldn't book my massage at all in a 2-month window.   Upon arrival, I didn't realize I was dealing with the owner, and she was downright snooty. She was impatient (despite there being no other customers) and actually looked me up and down with pursed lips!  (I was in jeans, a white top, and a new J.Jill sweater -- not dressed like a bum).  When I asked if we could schedule my massage, she said she had cancellations that day and could take me, which I hadn't planned for. I rearranged my schedule and took the massage appt. Both services (facial and massage) were outstanding. I get massages monthly, and sometimes bi-weekly, and it was  excellent. The facial was very thorough and effective, too. I highly recommend both.  When it came time to check out, Devon made a point of showing me a list of recommended gratuity amounts, which I found tacky and insulting. I had already tipped the massage therapist $25, and I was holding a $20 to give the skincare tech for the facial. I'm not sure if she thought I was going to split the $20 between them or what, but frankly, what I tip is between me and the person who provided the service. She then showed me the products that I had discussed with the skincare tech that I needed, and it wasn't until I purchased the products that Devon warmed to me. All told, between the Groupon, the products, the body scrub, and the tips, I spent over $300, and I certainly didn't deserve so much attitude.  I feel badly for giving a mediocre recommendation because the massage therapist and skincare technician were excellent, but they need to work at a place that welcomes their clients... even the Groupon users!",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 3.0

Well today I went there to pick up some brisket and some ribs for my Super Bowl get together when I decided to try one of their hamburgers.

The interior and décor are modern, stylish, and will accommodate parties of all sizes.

I tried four different styles of beer.  All were pleasantly tasty and represented the style well.  The food. . .well, I wouldn't come here for the food.  The menu is eclectic, but the app's we ordered just weren't that good.  The smoked wings were subsequently under-fried.  The tres dip app seemed to be a conglomeration of commercially purchased chips, salsa and guac, paired with home-made ceviche.  They seemed to have a few service kinks to work out as well.

"You can never really go wrong with Bern's Steak House they've been around forever and there's a reason why, their food is exceptional, staff is very friendly/knowledgeable, and the atmosphere is very beautiful.  We ate there with our daughter and her family and although they are known for their steaks they also have a great selection of seafood. I ordered a salad and the bleu cheese dressing is one of the best I've had. The French onion soup was great as well cooked perfectly. Berns can be a bit noisy at times and the decor is a bit outdated but the food and exceptional service is worth it, we also engaged in the dessert room which was fantastic as well. Everyone left satisfied and with to go containers, valet service is prompt. Berns is really the top notch premiere steakhouse in Tampa Bay. I'd say if you're visiting and want really good food Berns is it. Side note- Much of their food comes from their farm so know that you are putting quality healthy choices on your plate.

"My boyfriend and I go here regularly for sushi - probably once every two months at least for the last year and a half. This and watari are our go to places for sushi. We're big sushi lovers. When I used to live in Vancouver, I'd do shabusen almost biweekly   I've gone a couple of times where the sashimi didn't taste very fresh or they didn't thaw it out enough and pieces were still kind of frozen... but for the most part their sashimi tastes awesome. I also love that they have mackerel as a sashimi option - watari does not.   We've gone a couple of times during rush hour and have always been seated rather quickly. If you go after 7:30, the place is usually dead and you have a nice quiet restaurant. If they're busy, they do sometimes forget some things you order on your slip. Just ask and they'll tell you if it's still coming - easy to reorder if there was any confusion! The girls that work there are usually really nice, too.  Parking can kind of be a pain when it's busy - like 6 of the 15 or so parking spots there belong to the laundromat next door and they're always watching to see if sushi goers are parking in their spots. There often lots of sketchy people in this area too since it's just off whyte and there's a 711 next door.  Because we go here so often, I never take pictures",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Maybe that's why I stick with appetizers here because it's the first page. That I can handle.  I do enjoy the atmosphere on a nice evening with their enormous patio area complete with cushions and a fire for those slightly chilling evenings. The place is great for a sports bar. They have tvs literally everywhere possible....including bathrooms. So I see why it does the business considering all the sporting events Indy hosts.

I liked how the batter wasn't too thick and you could tell that they used fresh ingredients. Also, the platter comes with hush puppies, which were amazing!!! I knew I had to try alligator before leaving NOLA, and to my surprise, it tasted a lot like chicken. I got the blackened one since our other dish was fried, but it ended up being a good choice!

"I started with a cucumber salad.  The substance around the seeds in a cucumber has a lot of water and if this substance/seeds is not removed when cucumber is used in a salad, this extra water has a tendency to dilute the salad dressing.  And this is what happened with my salad, ultimately turning it into quite a bland way to start dinner.  Next was the lamb.  The raviolis were flavorful, fresh made, and delightful.  The strips of lamb that accompanied the ravioli were tough and under-seasoned - seemingly poor quality lamb at $30 for the entree.......  Thankfully, the mint  pesto helped to offset some of this.  The fennel used in the entree was not prepared properly and was too tough to bite.  Overall, a lot of money for what I view as basic cooking mistakes.  Not clamoring to head back soon, but plenty of other folks are, so my lack of patronage will be inconsequential.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I really like this place, and it makes me sad to give it a low rating. The food is always very good, and I love the way the restaurant is perched up on a hill overlooking town. I always enjoy the Lomo Adobado.  The service here fluctuates wildly. Last Wednesday night, I brought a group of 10 in for a quick meal (we had reservations and a meeting to get to) - and the server was superb. All checks were correctly split, even as we complicated matters by wanting to cover 2 of the diners between all of us. A wonderful experience, and everyone was happy.   The Monday previous, I came in for lunch with 2 professional colleagues - one who had never been to Tucson, and I was trying to show him how great our little town is. Epic fail. Fifteen minutes before we could place an order. 45 more minutes before lunch arrived. We were starving when we got the food, but had to ask for silverware. Napkins arrived, still no silverware. Food was delish when we finally got to eat it. But we had to wait forever for the check and I never did get my to-go box. Lunch took 2 hours. Waiter seemed completely, pardon the pun, out to lunch.  I mentioned it to the bartender when I returned with a party of 10, and he could have given two shits less. He just shrugged and said, ""well, lunch is our busiest time.""

"I loved this place upon my 1st visit and I've actually never been inside the restaurant.  My mom and uncle were in town from Indiana and wanted a seafood platter ( she get's one every single time she comes to Nola and eats like 3 shrimp), i had my 2 tween daughters and we were dressed very casual.  So Katie's fit our scenario.  We got here at 4:30 on a Saturday not having had lunch and were immediately seated outside as we requested.  We started off with the chargrilled oysters as my mom told her brother all about them.  I of course told him cautiously ""the best are at Drago's so I'm not sure if these will measure up"" WRONG!  Shocked as I was they were almost as good if not as good.  Absolutely delish and the oysters were big!  My mom and uncle each got their own seafood platters with the extra softshell crab.  The crabs seemed a little small to me but that could be because of the late season.  Everything was fried to perfection. ( i know cuz I had to eat part of mom's.....smh).  I got the lasagna.  The lasagna is cooked individually in little casserole bowls that they serve it in.  A little too salty but tasty none the less.  My daughters got a grilled shrimp platter and fettucine alfredo and seemed satisfied.  I love how it's right in a neighborhood.  The next door neighbors were bbq'ing right by us.  It felt like we were just hanging out and the waiter was a buddy just bringing us food.  We got there so early that there wasn't a crowd but i hear it gets packed.

My Asian friend got his haircut here by Laura Sumner and it was one of the worst haircuts he's ever had. Maybe the lady didn't know how to cut Asian hair--apparently she tried to style it like a 50s style greaser (think James Dean) which was completely bizarre. The final touch was to randomly hack at great chunks of hair (to blend the cut?) but it just made Jia haircut look really sloppy and uneven. You can tell from his bangs now (a couple weeks after the cut) which vary in length by an inch!  I got my hair cut here around Aug 2009 and it was underwhelming. An older man cut my hair; I don't know what his name was but he was nice enough. But I asked for a simple layering of my mid-length wavy hair and he tried his best.

The service is slow, but I think it's intentional so sad to let patrons linger; the couple next to me said they were in a hurry and the service picked up. I should have gone to Acme next door.

There was clearly not enough room on the table for it and very little effort was made to clear dishes away as we finished. This restaurant is described as family friendly, but on seeing our family, the wait staff seemed to want to make our dining experience as deliberately difficult as possible. We did not complain.

"The only reason I am giving one star is because of Bonnie in customer service dept. Other than that the ENTIRE experience was a nightmare.  Our sales person told us what was necessary to make her sale, knowing that the item was not in stock even though we specifically asked. We did not learn this fact until it was time for the sectional to be delivered and we never received a call about delivery. We took the initiative to call and that is when we were told only half of the sectional was in stock. Then we had a 3 piece wall unit delivered. The large pieces were put in place and then the parts to secure it were handed off to us and we were told we have to DIY.  Yet another call was made to find out what was going on. We were told that is not normal and they will send a tech out in a week to complete installation and pick up a protection kit we were charged for but never agreed to purchase.  When it came time for the tech to come and complete installation he was an hour late and yet again we had to call to see what was going on. I, the customer had to point out the fact the safety hazard this unstable wall unit presented and they need to be more careful bc this could cause injuries and potential law suits. Not to mention charging items w/o customers consent. Bonnie has done her best to make this unpleasant situation bearable.

"They have done a great job remodeling their hotel into a Vegas-style spa resort.  Once you stay here, there's no need to leave the premises.  They have everything from bars/lounges, shopping, restaurants, coffee shop, gaming (of course), private dining, wedding chapels, airport shuttle, internet, spa, fitness, pools, business center, convention rooms, arcade, waffle cones, night club, and valet.  Our room overlooked the massive resort pools, and the kids had a blast swimming in their heated pools.  Made good use of our jet tub & free kids movie.  Kudos to their Marketing Director who thought of the family fun pack - awesome deal.  Everyone's a winner here, as the parents get to dine/wine in a variety of venues w/ live music and grandparents get to play on numerous penny slots.  When all is said and done, we head back to our rooms & kick back...so relaxing.  One draw back is that their Tuscany Tower is quite a distance from the casino floor, whereas most casinos drop you straight down from hotel room to casino & vice versa.

"Massa's would get a perfect score based on the Cesar salad alone. It's the bar for which all other Cesar dressings has been set. Heavy on the anchovy ... thick ... creamy ... tangy ... it's literally everything! (Drool)  Cesar aside (which truly is remarkable) ... I am afraid we have had a few problems. Issues with cleanliness and the quality of other dishes have fallen short.   I took my hubb there for his first time after raving about the Cesar. And we didn't even get past the drinks before we had to leave as he was on the verge of getting sick. Not once ... but twice the waitress served him water with something truly disgusting floating in it ... but not before he sucked down part of it with the first glass. Oh it was really gross.   I talked him into trying it again, and he mentioned the previous issue to the waiter. The waiter remembered the incident and told him it was because ""the nozzles were being cleaned properly at the time."" So it was some alien combination of mold and residue ... gag. They offered nothing but a shrug to help mediate the fact that he choked down what looked like a science experiment and possibly the cure for cancer. Gag.   He sticks to wine usually if I can drag him there for a salad, as the nozzle damage has been done ... and cannot be trusted, lol. We have tried a couple pastas, a sandwich, and an entree or two. It's all kinda bad honestly. Not terrible, but not goods Just ... eh. The prices are reasonable. The ambiance is strange ... very boudoir, which is nothing like their other locations.

The balcony was a prime spot for people watching.

One of them was even trying to teach my boyfriend how to commission a girl to lift up her shirt. Gross. Honestly, I've never seen so many strangers' boobs in my life.  The highlight of my night was seeing a guy totally faceplant right in the middle of Bourbon. He was trying to show off his air spinning skills to his buddies, but failed. Badly.

On two separate occasions, I have come to Green Eggs Cafe around 10:45-11 on a Sunday to try these allegedly spectacular pancakes. The hostess that works on the weekends is a total moron. Honestly.  After waiting forty-five minutes for a table, (in her defense, she said it would be a 30-45 min wait), we went in to just ask where our name was on the list. The girl greeted my friend by saying, ""Hi, how many?"" The moron had already forgotten who we were, and that we had been outside waiting for nearly an hour. Then, she proceeds to tell us it will be another 30 min as there are 7 parties ahead of us. Ok, fine, we actually waited the additional 30 minutes, and then asked her again to tell us where we were on the list. She said that it shouldn't be long, only two more parties in front of us. She calls out the next two parties, and we are certain that our name will be called next this time. Nope-she calls a table of 5 guys that had come in 20 minutes after my friends and I! Of course, we march in to complain and she stares at us, looks down at the list again as if she has no idea what she did wrong, becomes completely flustered, and still neglected to seat us at the moment. Obviously we left after that.   I don't care how good these pancakes are, I will NEVER ever try to go to this place again.

"The food at lolita is good, but good food should be the norm at a restaurant especially when you are paying around $25+ per entree. There are other things about this restaurant that makes me not want to return:    We arrived at the restaurant around 6pm when it was completely empty, except for 1 table. The servers and hostess clearly saw that we had entered the restaurant, but took all the time in the world to greet us. When we told them that we were a party of four and waiting for 2 more guests, the hostess told us that it was their ""policy"" they could not sit us until all members of the party arrived. So my husband and I stood amongst the empty tables, annoyed with the hostess's attitude.   When we were finally seated and read the menu, we noticed that the restaurant also had a ""policy"" of $18 food minimum per guest. On top of everything else, this restaurant is cash only.  Considering that each entree was $20+, this policy was obviously not that difficult to meet. But what if a customer was not in the mood to order an entree and just wanted an appetizer?

This property is inexcusable. My colleague and I checked in and we got to our rooms only to find it extremely dark. There was one lamp per room and otherwise dimly lit. This was strategic to hide the bed bugs that were crawling  up walls and in bed and on chair. Not only were there bed bugs but at closer look with a flashlight there was mold on walls. The manager on duty was unapologetic at best and we left promptly to find another hotel to stay the night but had to throw our suitcases and belongings away. 4 days later I'm still waiting on the General Manager and Hilton properties to make right on the awful experience.

"Hinkle Fieldhouse is the Basketball arena on the Butler University Campus in Indianapolis,IN.  It was built in 1928 and is one of the oldest  basketball arenas still in use.  It was named for local legend, Paul D. ""Tony"" Hinkle who coached Butler for 41 years.  It also holds a special place in the heart of Basketball crazy Indiana.    Parts of the Indiana State High School Basketball Tournament are held here every year.  It was during one of those State Tournaments that Hoosiers witnessed, ""The Milan Miracle.""  In 1954, Milan H.S., a small High School in Indiana, took on state powerhouse, Munice Central for the state championship and unbelievably won.  The story inspired one of the greatest sports movies ever, ""Hoosiers.""   Today, Hinkle Fieldhouse continues to draw in Basketball crowds for the High School games and to watch the Butler Bulldogs continue to grow as an great team nationally.  Part of that Hoosier magic makes Butler ""the little team that could"" nearly every year in the NCAA  Tournament.  Hinkle Fieldhouse is held in such high esteem, that the Pacers designed their own fieldhouse, Conseco Fieldhouse, after it.  On a personal note, this building holds a lot of memories for me.  I grew up in a house about 2 blocks from Hinkle Fieldhouse.  My parents bought that house from Mr. Hinkle himself. I heard stories from our old neighbor that Tony Hinkle never showed emotion on the court, he never got angry.  But, after a lose his wife would have to sew up the lining of his pants pockets because he ripped them to shreds.  As a kid ,I'd ride my bike around the Fieldhouse and sneak in to watch Butler games.  I met my favorite basketball player, Reggie Miller, there when he was shooting a commercial.  I also saw some of the greatest High School Basketball games ever played there.  If you are a basketball fan and you are in Indianapolis, you have to go check out Hinkle Fieldhouse.  They've done some renovations, but it still looks the same.  ESPN did a documentary on it called, ""Indiana's Basketball Cathedral.""  In a state as crazy about Basketball as Indiana, thats something special.  To me Hinkle FieldHouse is a cathedral.",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 5.0

"I love coming here for brunch- it is definitely a good place, but not sure if it lives up the the hype that comes with its name. They don't take reservations and are cash-only, so be prepared for that. On a weekend, if you come at 11am, you could still be waiting another 1-2 hours before you can get a table, so come EARLY rather than later if you don't like waiting. Alternatively, I came once around 2-3pm on a weekday and it was empty so that's another option if you're not interested in waiting. In terms of the food, things are pretty good  - Kitchen Sink: a MUST-GET. I have to order this every time I come here. It's just amazing and delicious and you will love it, I promise. It has a perfect melding of flavors and textures that all feel so brunchy - Buffalo Mac and Cheese: very good if you're into rich and dense mac and cheese. I love it because it also has a little kick from the buffalo, but sometimes it can be a little too salty or a little too dense for my liking, so I don't get it all the time. - Red Velvet Pancakes: honestly, not really worth the hype. They're not super special. Although they're fun so I would say if you're coming here with a friend, if everyone orders their own entree, they'll let you order a kids/smaller portion of the Red Velvet Pancakes. That should be enough for everyone to get a kick out of it and taste it, but you definitely do not need a full regular adult portions full of these. - French Toasts (I've tried various kinds): also pretty good. Sometimes hit or miss depending on what seasonal ingredients they add to it. More often than not, feels a little dry or a little too sweet, but if you're in the mood for that, then this would definitely satisfy your appetite - fresh squeezed orange juice: YES. get this too",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Mangia is a great place to have in the neighborhood. The environment is open and artistic, without an ounce of contrivance. Whether you're planning a celebratory dinner for 10, cocktails and jazz for the end of a date, or a super-casual midnight beer and slice of pizza, Mangia is there for you. I wouldn't say it exceeds five star culinary standards, but the food is consistent and good. I like that it doesn't try to be something it isn't. This place makes South Grand, period. I recommend ordering the G.O.C. (light on the oil), checking out the excellent draught beer selection (try the English Pale Ale), and going on a night when Dave Stone is playing. And if you live near SG, thank your lucky stars for Mangia.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Man to woman ratio is EXTREMELY high here, so guys, if you're looking to pick up a girl - this is not the place for you.  Unless it's me (I heart centipede... and donkey kong.... and tapper....  you see my point.)  Anyway, no one really seemed to mind that, as the beer list is good and there are video games to be played.    I went on a weekend and despite the ""line"" that there was to get in (took like 2 minutes) it wasn't overly crowded.  After some of the reviews I had fears of lines, and rioting over who is next to play Ms. Pacman.  There are a FEW (3-5) games that have ""lines"" of 1-2 people.    I am going to take it down a star from sheer awesomeness to a 4 star because of the slow bar service.  There seemed to be enough of them working, but they didn't really have a good system... or something.  Each time I went to get a beer I waited whatever was ""too long"" in my book at that moment.

I went to get a bowl of chili which to my surprise was hot I had to wait 15minutes to even get a clean bowl. The only good thing I can say about the chili was its temp, no seasoning & had things in it I was not able to identify. The bourbon chicken which is usually my favorite was so dried out & burnt it was not edible. Staff wise everyone was friendly, especially Nick.

"I didn't know what to think when my girlfriend suggested this place. It's off the beaten path of Fayette Street and the neighborhood isn't the prettiest, but I'm glad I didn't judge a book by its cover! I am glad that she recommended this place. The decor has a rustic farmhouse feel to it! Cute electric lightbulbs add to the charm of the table setting. Lots of rich reclaimed wood shades and very peaceful for Sunday brunch. There is an accordion window that would be nice for the summertime to get some airflow- however there isn't much to see if patrons are sitting on the patio. In the back of the space is an open kitchen with a nice pizza oven. Right inside the door is a nice little bar with a tv for all the people that need to watch the game. The music was a tad bit too loud to have conversation! We were seated right the speaker and I found myself straining to hear my girlfriends. I had the strawberry and procuittio arugula salad. It was nicely dressed, the greens were fresh. I wish that there was bread for the table but we had a nice Peach Bellini to fill the void( albeit pricey for the burbs, but tasty, so I didn't miss it too much. My one gripe was that the food didn't all come to the table at the same time so I had to look at my salad for a couple of minutes before they other food arrived. the waiter was attentive, but didn't refill our water, thankfully he left the bottle on our table so we helped ourselves. He didn't rush us out the door as we were chatting for quite a while. All in all, it gets a solid 3.5 stars. I will be back for the Nutella donuts!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"3.5  It's interesting to re-visit Tin Angel as a bona fide adult. I think most people who have any history with Nashville can share in the above sentiment. Back before the days of celeb chefs and pricey Southern staples, Tin Angel was one of the chief go-tos for anniversaries, brunches, Barrister Balls, etc. So, now that the city has changed around it, I thought it might be cool to revisit what used to be one of my out-out-towner choices.  It holds up pretty well. The beer list won't win over craft beer lovers and the menu isn't as adventurous as some of the other nearby options but Tin Angel is what it is. I enjoy the fact that it's managed to stay true to self in the midst of rapid (and, all around) change. Parking is *still* a hassle (pro-tip: go for the street; not even think about the lot). The restaurant is *still* really dark (this could have advantages). The staff is *still* very nice (save for a bumpy start - no greeting at the hostess stand - the evening was perfectly lovely). These are elements that Tin Angel has held on to and it helps retain the 'fundamentally Nashville' feel it has.  Since I didn't find the sour or fruit beer I was looking for and because my friend didn't want wine, I opted to drink water with my meal. The water here is crisp, very cold and not filled to the brim with ice. My glass never emptied and, personally, it was a nice change of pace to concentrate solely on the flavors of my food and not my beverage. I should try this experiment more often. I wasn't very inspired by the appetizer options but we settled on the bacon-wrapped figs with honey & goat cheese. They were quite tasty but that's the expectation, right? Bacon. Figs. Goat cheese. Honey. The components are all delicious. They should be (and, were) delicious together. Where I think the menu oversold itself was my entree option. I went for the Chicken DaVinci and think that the description was better than the execution. On paper, it sounds lovely: Roasted chicken breast stuffed with prosciutto & provolone   cheese on grilled Parmesan polenta; sun-dried tomato & mushroom Marsala sauce served with roasted broccolini. Heavenly, right? Despite the heavy cheese description, I tasted very little cheese throughout the dish. My chicken breast was small, tough and dry. The broccolini was more wilted than roasted and the accompanying sauce wasn't as bright as I expected it to be. The star of the plate was the polenta. Despite the lack of cheese, it was very nicely prepared and served as the unifying element of the meal. The dish has potential (it sounds lovely) but the execution was just alright. Where Tin Angel won back points (and my overall impression) was dessert. Since we forwent booze, we'd earned dessert. They were both fantastic. We talked about splitting but wound up concentrating on the desserts we chose. My friend spent time with the apple blackberry crisp. Served piping hot and exactly what you'd expect it to taste like, the dish was elevated by the cinnamon ice cream. I would have been very happy with it... had I not been pigging out on the Chocolate & Caramel Indulgence. The dish lived up to its name. I found it to be more on the caramel side but that's quite fine with me. The dessert is a chocolate cake with a milk chocolate, sea salt and caramel center -- served warm with vanilla ice cream. Tin Angel finished strong. Well done.   I might not be back every week but I'll be back. With almost 25 years in existence, Tin Angel's earned the right to have a stumble or two. I think I'll investigate the prix fixe next time.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0

Since we were nearby we decided to stop in anyway. The restaurant was half empty and stayed that way until we left. The hostess made a face like we were an imposition into her quiet night, then in a benevolent gesture granted us a table under a bright light next to the waiters' stand.  Ok, we're in! Bread comes out looking like little fingers. Not much to that and no butter included. Our ravioli dishes were mediocre and overpriced. The $35 lobster pappardelle was a huge letdown. Flavor was fair, but it was mostly a bowl of pasta with little crumbles of ""lobster""meat that I'm pretty sure was nothing more than frozen crawfish, thawed and chopped.

"The ""old"" King George closed a few years ago after serving mediocre food at high prices.  The new restaurant, run by the original owners, is back up and running and what a dramatic improvement over the past.    Because of its history, we just wanted to try some basic entrees along with a salad that was included for an additional $3.00 - we were not disappointed.  The Caesar salad was fresh and very good.  The Fish and Chip entrée brought a very generous portion of nicely fried battered-dipped cod (?) with crispy fries, coleslaw and tartar sauce.  The pan-roasted chicken with brussel  sprouts and maple-glazed sweet potato was delicious, with the chicken being done perfectly.  For the above, with a glass of wine and a beer, the bill, before tip, came to around $50.  There is a large selection of tempting-sounding appetizers and salads, and some entrees coming with half or full portions, so you don't have to spend a lot of money.  Prices for the entrees run from around $13 to a high of around $32.  Most are in the $18 to $23 dollar range.

"I took my two grand daughters in for pedicures and polish on their finger nails. Total was $33 each ($25 pedi, $8 finger polish). On top of that I tipped a full 20%.  The 5 yr old's total time with Tee, the tech servicing her, was less than 20 min. Mya, who did the 8 yr old took longer but her nails were very sloppily done and polish was on her skin and she didn't even clean it off!  I should have said something but the girls were excited and I didn't want to cause a scene. Within 5 hours the polish had come COMPLETELY off of their fingers and about halfway off their toes. I called and told John (I don't know if he is the owner or just works there) about it and he was very nice and said to bring them back and they'd redo their nails. My daughter in law took them back as I couldn't.  They ONLY redid their finger nails. As my DIL watched Tee, who was EXTREMELY rude and jerky with the girls (I can only guess b/c she wasn't getting paid for the redo) was finishing up, my DIL told her that she had only put the top coat on the left hand, not the right.  Tee argued with her that she had. My DIL asked her to do it again and she finished with the 5 yr old, got her supplies and left, without putting the topcoat on. My DIL told John about this and he argued that Tee had put the topcoat on and he saw her do it. How could he see her when he was at the front desk????  So they left and guess what???  Again, within a few hours the polish had chipped off big time!  That was it for me. Today I went in and got Tee and John together and told them who I was. I recapped what had happened with Tee and the topcoat and showed them a picture of the left hand vs right hand. She and John immediately argued and became angry with me that I was questioning them. They argued that she had put it on. I had a picture to prove that the polish had come off the right hand, not the left, the one she put it on, yet again and within a few hours!  They told me my DIL was very rude and I was rude. I said no, they were the ones who were rude and if that's the way they treat their customers, it's a wonder they are still in business. They have lost me, two daughter in laws and a daughter as customers.  The sad thing is, they do not care!  They usher you in and out so that they can get to the next money provider. I really liked the two nail techs I used there but the management and the way they treat a customer when something is wrong, is beyond me. I will never walk through their door again and if you care about customer service, you won't either. I just hate it for my grand daughters because they cried when their polish came off...both times, within five hours.  I hate it for myself because I did like my nail tech.

"I have to say that the people up front usually try to work hard to please people not making a stand in line much I think the store is huge and they have just about everything you could want, but I must say that getting prescriptions here are the biggest nightmare in the universe I've never seen so many people working behind the counter and it moving so slow. I think CVS needs to update the way that they fill prescriptions maybe they need to start putting in those machines where all they do is keep it stocked and they actually did a drop down the prescription in little packets that you then take up front and pay for? I think the pharmacist aren't as nice as they could be and I know that they always seem to have a line they're waiting for prescriptions somebody do something and set us free who wants to spend their life standing in line for a prescription especially if you get more than one a month?",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 3.0

"First, let me say this was the first really bad experience we have had at this restaurant. When we first walked in, it smelled really bad inside. I believe it was the carpet and it is in dire need of steam cleaning to freshen it up. From where we were sitting, it was obvious the carpet needed a good vacuuming also, especially under the booth seats. Okay, enough on the cleanliness... let's move on to the food. It didn't get any better...  my husband ordered the salmon with tomato vinegarette topping with a side of broccoli. They used to have fresh broccoli, but apparently now it comes frozen and they sautéed it... fresh is so much better... and the topping on the salmon... was COLD!  When we asked, we were told it was supposed to be cold... but there was so much cold dressing and tomatoes that the salmon wasn't even warm...  contrary to my chicken parmesan which was dark brown (burned) around the edges and the burned cheese made it look like it had a disease.  I will say my side of spaghetti was relatively good, not much sauce though, but it was hot but not burned!  Needless to say, the entire lunchtime meal was totally the worst we've had in a long time and extremely disappointing for Carrabas. We are not the type of people to try to get something for nothing, so when the waiter offered to comp the meal, we said no, as we did eat the salads and the bread. When the check came, he had taken the salmon meal off, and my husband insisted to put it back on the bill, which he reluctantly did. We paid the bill in full and left the waiter a substantial tip; after all, it wasn't his fault the food wasn't cooked properly. It will be a long time before we frequent that establishment again...",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"First time visit on April 25th. This three year young Japanese restaurant is very upscale inside with black table cloths. Tables are arranged for two to four seating apparently expecting a lot of couples. Top 40 music is the background. The two female servers I met were friendly and professional.  The luncheon offers some reasonably priced items. I chose shrimp and vegetable tempura which included white sticky rice and a choice of salad with ginger dressing or Miso soup. The ginger dressing made the salad since the lettuce  was ordinary iceberg. They need to inspire it with shredded carrots, radish and some bean sprouts. Perhaps some sesame seeds.  Teriyaki batter was tasty and was fried just the right amount. Vegetables included sweet potato, broccoli, a stalk of asparagus and an onion ring which tied them all together. Fresh mushrooms would have been a nice addition.  The entree including hot Jasmine tea came to $12. Reasonable these days when the standard price for most lunches ranges from $15-20 easily. Very enjoyable!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I did the Egmont key excursion a couple of weeks ago and thought it was great value for money.  The crew were excellent, the captain was personable and funny and the first mate was extremely helpful and informative.  The tour is about 4 hours but they are flexible with taking a little extra time if there are dolphins, or other interesting marine life, to be seen. On our trip we saw enormous Tarpons jumping out of the water and a few Dolphins.  Egmont Key is very pretty but the first hour to explore was a little boring so I'd suggest taking your towel and going to the beach to enjoyt the pristine sand and crystal clear water. The Snorkeling part of the tour was good but not spectacular. The staff were really helpful and gave us a lot of info and a safety briefing but the current was quite strong the day we went and the water was not too clear. If you have your own snorkel gear, I would recommend bringing it as the boat's gear is the standard tour gear and is just adequate.   Overall, the trip was really enjoyable and well worth the money.

For my entree I had the Farfalle Frutti di Mare (Mussels, shrimp, and sea scallops sautéed with garlic and white wine over bowtie pasta). Simply amazing. I wanted to keep eating even though I was full. My husband had the special, which was a stuffed pork chops that was equally amazing. My eight year old had a ravioli plate. After he was done, he exclaimed it was his new favorite place. Now everything is extremely fresh and made to order including the table side Italian loaf.

"Gone is the ho-hum bog standard  Mexican eats on State Street, Chilango's has remodeled their restaurant and menu and I love it!  The place is now a proper sit-down restaurant with wait service, still in an comfortable intimate setting, with good sellable art on the walls and a menu that highlights tapas, interesting flavors, spiceful spices and fresh ingredients.   We started with bacon wrapped dates, cleverly titled ""cheap date."" Har har. I got the seared ahi, served very rare, on a bed of cilantro rice, and topped with sauteed chiles ($15). The sauteed jalapeno had a good flavor with only a little bite to it. I shared my dish and got to steal some morsels of chicken mole enchiladas. Those were very rich and creamy, and also came with rice and black beans ($14, I think?). Also ordered was an axiote seasoned chicken burrito served wet with a mole sauce, $8 ot $10 depending on if this one came from the menu or the specials.  They have local Telegraph beer on tap and the summer Wheat Ale, which is normally not my favorite from Telegraph's line, was perfectly pulled and a delight to drink.  The food was very good, much better than the tostada bowls and nachos of the old Chilango's. The interior is also much improved, with more class and elegance to it. This is now a place one can dine at with a date or good friends you enjoy some quality chatter with.  I've uploaded pictures of some of our food and interior. The latter is very fuzzy, but still gives a taste of what the place is like now. They've done a good job decorating with lots of Ikea gear.

I understand having a few for taste, but there were so much that I couldn't get the cilantro taste out of my mouth. The ""hamburger"" bun was cold and hard. The taste wasn't bad, and I wish the kitchen could have toast it or grill it a bit.  Service was not there yet.

No funky smell, a few seats open, cool big red and black fish art on the wall and some really cool big like drift wood tables.  There even some tables where you can sit on pillows and eat the traditional thai way!   I had the Hunters Club roll, Wonton Soup and just a simple Spicy Tuna. I love a menu with complete 4 x 6 photos of each specialty roll. I want to see what to expect and if it has too much fish on it or not. I'm all about menus with more photos and less reading. Very cool /different kind of menu. The sushi chef was all smiles and asked how the rolls were. Good. In the bar/where you can see the raw fish I saw some eggs. Quail eggs. The Chef asks if I'd like to try some for free - he went on tell me they use it some thai items. I learned something new!   The service was fast, and friendly. Cool atmosphere and I'd say the sushi is good. Not great but good. Parking wasn't a problem for me, but it is somewhat limited.  The prices were average. $5 for basic roll, $8-$11 for specialty, and my cup of soup was $2.50   I also looked for anyone eating thai dishes, and I couldn't see anyone.

"We visited during Fan Fair (now known as CMA Fest) in June. The company that hosted us booked several rooms for the weekend. Our room was in the main tower (the one where the lobby elevators are). We had a nice sized room and king bed, refrigerator, couch and table. It was the perfect size for us. I liked the way the room was laid out as you rounded the corner from the front door or bathroom the bed was on that wall facing the window (not like most hotel rooms with the window to the side of the bed). The room also had black out curtains (a must if you are painting the town red every night which we did).   They have valet (I'm not sure if there are other options we just used the valet and never needed the car again until we left). They have starbucks in the lobby as well as a bar and breakfast food (for cost). The lobby area and restaurant / bar area are all in one space which is nice when you are waiting for others and want to grab a quick drink.   Everyone we encountered was extremely helpful. The pool area was something we looked forward to but due to the fact it was not monitored the attire and rowdy atmosphere created by those there before us was not something we wanted to join in on so we skipped it.   The location of this hotel cannot be beat. You are close enough to downtown to catch an uber and be there in minutes without a huge expense. There are several restaurants and bars within walking distance (some that stay open late if you are looking to extend your night into the mornng hours).   I would say the only downside to this hotel was our view. When we checked in we thought great a view of a nearby restaurant...but not really. When we looked down the view we had was the restaurants garbage containers...and that meant garbage trucks early in the morning, noise being made late at night when they were throwing out the garbage etc etc. Our friends were in a different tower and their view was of a wall. Not great. But otherwise I have no complaints!",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 4.0

The drive-through was open but we had no vehicle and had walked a mile.  I returned the following day and service was extremely slow.  No surprise there.

"I just drove from the Bay Area out to Black Hole to have my nipple pierced, as piercers in California can't work due to COVID. I had a great experience. It is not the cheapest shop you can go to but in my experience you definitely get what you pay for with body mods! I had Jessica as my piercer and she was a dream. Put me as much at ease as she could have. And the piercing didn't hurt, it was just pressure! My ONLY complaint was that the person at the jewelry counter said the basic jewelry was steel. I had called prior and asked and knew it was actually titanium, and my piercer wrote that it was titanium on my aftercare card. So I'm happy about that, but I do wish the person at the counter had been more knowledgeable. That's really my only complaint, though! The person at the welcome kiosk was also nice.

"Not really sure what's going on here - (or going down). It is obviously nice to have a local neighborhood store; but this particular store has pretty much become the ""supplemental store"". It has just enough name brand groceries to still be a Schnucks store. Most of the products are either generic brands, or schnucks brands. I would take exception with this analysis given the current times we are in with covid and assuming that perhaps suppliers are not necessarily adequately stock to fill the shelves. However, when visiting the store location on Clayton Rd. ; not only is it a significantly aesthetically nicer location, it is also better stocked with what seems to be an over-abundance of higher quality name brand groceries. (if i'm spending my money, I want what I want and it's not Schnucks brand products) Sorry not Sorry. The prices are no less at the Lindell Blvd. location and most often the particular products I am seeking are not available. I have to drive a little further (hopping onto the highway for a 10-15 drive opposed to 4-5 minute drive). But i'd just as soon as spend the extra gas money and drive a further distance than to continue to shop at what feels like another local inner city Schnucks location on the verge of closing.",Business Category: Grocery,Review Stars: 2.0

"My overall opinion of this place is that the food is very mediocre and over priced for what you're getting. I think the only thing on this menu that is tolerable is the Prime Rib Philly but you can expect to pay extra for that. Their rolls (or scones as they call them) are freaking delicious. You can eat your money's worth in those alone. If they're nice enough they might bring you soft butter so you can actually spread it on the rolls. Some people really enjoy places like this and many have had a great experience here. I think my in-laws and grandparents would absolutely love this place. I, however, won't be back and I won't be taking any guests here ever.  Some good things to say: I thought the service was excellent. My waitress was very kind and friendly and it was obvious that she knew how to do her job and did it well. Actually, every staff member I encountered was friendly and helpful. That's always nice.

"Mole Y Abuela Rooftop Tapas Bar & Restaurant overtook the former Fly Bar Tapas Restaurant space on North Franklin Street in Downtown Tampa and manages to offer even smaller portion sizes in their tapas than their predecessor, Fly Bar. The restaurant redesign features exposed brick, light colored wood, more comfy booths, and tons of cacti hanging all over the place.  The rooftop bar area got a much needed upgrade with better comfy padded seating, and a larger ceiling added to the center bar to provide additional shade from the sun on the rooftop bar.   Happy Hour is 5-7PM Monday through Friday and 3-6PM on Weekends and includes $4 select tapas, $3 Corona drafts, $7 Frose, $7 Frozen Mole Margaritas, and half off spirits, domestic drafts, and wine by the glass.   Happy hour tapas rated:  - Eggs Diablo includes just 3 deviled eggs topped with 1 tiny baby shrimp each  1/10   - Chicharonnes are just greasy pork rinds 1/10 - Bacon wrapped dates includes just 4 tiny dates 2/10  - Stuffed peppers includes just 2 tiny peppers 2/10  - Pappas Bravas include a large tasty portion of rosemary salted potatoes with garlic and brava aioli 9/10  Other tapas rated:  - Shrimp Escabeche includes just 3 shrimp for $12 4/10 - Jamon & Queso Croquettes includes just 3 tiny pieces for $8  6/10  - Lamb & Pork meatballs includes just 5 meatballs for $13 and the meatballs came out a bit dry and have a strange after-taste 4/10  Even the Entree, Gambas de Ajillo provides a portion size that is 1/4th the portion size of most appetizers includes just 3 sautéed shrimp for $15 with bread. 4/10   I can't recommend coming to Mole y Abuela if you are even remotely hungry at all. Ordering any food outside of happy hour will cost you a bundle as portion sizes of the tapas and entrees are so laughably small, you'll more than likely leave hungry. However, I'd recommend coming to Mole Y Abuela as a good spot with a chill vibe for drinks during happy hour. If you do order any food, I most highly recommend the pappas bravas! I also recommend checking out the rooftop area which offers some nice views of Downtown Tampa. For a rooftop with a better selection of custom craft cocktails I recommend the M Bird Tapas Bar at Armature works. Although portion sizes of their tapas are small there as well, they're still much larger than here. For generous portion sizes of seafood, sushi, and Italian with a great view of downtown, I recommend Jackson Bistro.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I wanted to love this restaurant it is charming and I love all that is French. Sadly, the owner was so mean, rude and unapologetic, that she literally made me cry. The steak that my sons and husband ordered was tough! When we asked to send it back, we were advised that we would have to wait 40 minutes. It had taken close to an hour to get our dinner and they were too hungry to wait another 40 minutes. I had worked with the staff to order surprise desserts for my husbands 50th birthday and they never brought them. When I went to see the manager; who actually is the owner; she raised her voice at me and told me that I never ordered the desserts. I did! The food was average, the attitude was unapologetically rude, distasteful and ruined my husband's 50th birthday. There are fabulous experiences to be had dining in Philadelphia.

"I counted 6 distinct areas in this funky bar and only 3 TVs.  Each area has just a little bit different attitude.  The first two shares a U-shaped bar with one side having booths and tables and the flip side being open dance floor for a house/electronica band that night.  The third front area was a all black (including plastic ceiling)  & raised band stage.  I will be back to review the sound because it did actually have speakers built into the stage and I want to know what it sounds like.  For a band with a small following this would be a great place watch the show.  The outside is smoking and is 3 different ideas.  The first is a covered (reminds me of a military aircraft hanger) area with a some indoor furniture.  The next is a descent sized patio where the smokers hang out.  The most interesting is the one that reminds me of park playground with large pebbles to play/fall on,  they even put a safety Teepee around an open firepit!  I am sorry, but between my nieces talking about his place and the rave reviews I found something funny... Plus it was final four week and the only TVs were rear projection without a good straightforward view (pointed above my head!)  I will admit if I knew anyone in the band or was in the mood to impress a 20 somethings hipster & posers...  I digress,  this bar is bigger and more diverse than what I thought.  My only real only complaint (other than TVs) is being charged $7 for rail vodka (I might know the taste) ""infused"" with chia tea.  I should have known when I got a sarcastic answer from the bartender when I asked about it.  I never had the combo and thought it would be good to try with Sky or better, but RAIL, each sip was ?!!!

"I came here today for the Jim Steranko signing, and it was totally worth the hour drive to come here. First, I was over the moon thrilled with the fact that a woman owns this shop. Sarah (I believe) is amazing. It's clear as day she cares about her store, her customers, and everyone who comes in regardless if they've been there before.   She was also super attentive to the kids who came in. She hung out and talked to them, set up a coloring table/LEGO play area for them, and you can tell she wants kids to feel welcome and safe here. THAT is how you get new customers, that is how you keep old customers, and that is how you should engage young comic fans. Aside from Third Eye in Annapolis MD, I can not name any other shop that cares as much as she does.   They have book clubs for every sort. They have a great selection of books and toys, and they have a Stern Batman pinball machine! I have the same one at home, but seeing it elsewhere was cool.   The bathrooms are also really clean.

Pretty much an automatic for me wanting to visit a place shortly after I notice. I think I bookmarked this on a Friday and was there Saturday for dinner.  We started off with the cheese roll and it hyped up my anticipation for the pizza even more. This cheese roll was absolutely ridiculous. It's essentially just a cheese calzone if you're struggling to picture it. And it's perfect. I'd go as far as saying it might be the best cheese-stuffed dough that I've ever had.  However, the pizza is what we came here for. And sadly, the pizza was just ok. My wife made the point that it seems like they use high quality ingredients, at least. And she might be right about that. But overall, I just wasn't super impressed.   We ordered half extra cheese, half pepperoni. I was kind of regretting ordering extra cheese because it was actually an overwhelming amount. It was essentially collapsing the dough and making it soggy. But when I tried a slice of my wife's pepperoni, it was the same thing.

"Recent visit for bike cleaner (S100). I did get immediate response from a female salesperson recently. Had I been in the market I'd do business with her. No pretense, no attitude, immediate attention and ask me to let her now if there was anything she could do. That alone gave me confidence that former issue may have been fixed. Hat's off to her and I wish her success.  I hope this is an indication they've fixed that ""This a Harley"" attitude. It doesn't work 98% of the time.  Former years I've gone here several times looking for bike and bought elsewhere. I've never felt they actually sold bikes or wanted too. I ended up going to Benson in Muncie. Two years later my wife was basically ignored there looking for a Sportster. HD of Indy did it again. I talked to people who had similar experiences. We'd joke it was a ""parts demo store"" with fully assembled motorcycles.   My experiences were usually with younger sales staff who appeared to have a ""buy it now or drive away"" attitude. ""This is Harley"" attitude. Problem, they seemed to have overlooked I was a ""buy it now"" guy 3 times. Each time I got brushed off I could go to another dealer the next day and ride a bike off the lot. Which is exactly what I did. I was at least looking for the convenience of using the dealer closest to me. What the hell?  The strengths: They have a great selection of parts and riding gear. The local riding (HOG) club was nice. There was a lot of good things about that dealership, motorcycle sales wasn't one of them.

"I am a regular Vero Amore customer. But the last time I paid them a visit was enough for me to decide I will never be coming back.  I usually order something that is not listed on the menu and they have always responded well to that and gotten me what I ask for. I've always gotten a certain size of this item for a certain price, and they've always told me there were 2 different sizes.  Last time I went, naturally I ordered what I usually do and they came out with the small size of the item and I asked them for the larger one, the waitress was EXTREMELY rude and responded ""well that's our only size, sorry"". To which I said ""but I always get the larger size, I never order the small"" so then she said ""well I can talk to my manager but I'm telling you, this is the only size"". She came back and said ""yeah my manager said this is the only size for this"". Most people at Vero Amore know me for my order, so it was disheartening that the ""manager"" couldn't come out and tell me himself or they could have at least tried to be more helpful and more respectful. I then got the check and was charged for the price of the large size when I was given the small size. After this I didn't say anything because I this point I didn't feel like putting up with more rudeness. All around the worst experience ever. I will not be setting foot in Vero Amore for an extremely long time, if at all. Terrible.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
Exceptional food quality and service. I suggest trying any special that they are offering for the day. It is likely you will never be disappointed with it. This café is more than what you'd expect from a hole in the wall restaurant.  No matter what time you arrive you should expect to wait to be seated as the place is small and the demand is high.

"This Old Country Buffet is in a strip mall off Route 41. They have a separate section of the parking lot but if necessary, parked cars can spill over to the rest of the strip mall parking lot.  One thing I found a little odd about OCB pricing is they now split the buffet and beverage into two separate charges. I suspect they did that so they can claim that breakfast is only $4.99, when in fact, most people add the beverage bar for an additional $1.99.  The food at this OCB is average for the buffet chain. They have what I like: the fried fish, the steamed veggies, the stir fried foods. However, the pulled pork and meatloaf were dry and have probably been under that heat lamp too long. Also, the soup had coagulated and so I didn't want to try that. The beverage bar is pretty good, as always. Have some chocolate milk. Given how much that typically sells for at the grocery store, that's probably your best value.  Service was done well this evening. I just thought that at 8:30pm, this restaurant closed a bit too early for my liking. The dining area and restroom seemed clean enough. No obvious issues there.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I have truly just become so sick of this place and their horrific customer service.  I just placed an online order with them through Eat24 and there was an error on the menu,   So, the woman called me and told me that I ordered wrong.  That I can't combine wings and fingers. Apparently the special I ordered is no longer available. Not really sure how I am supposed to know that but hey, whatevs!   She asked me if I made  an error and tried to order two separate items....I explained that I cannot alter the order form the menu.. I just point and click... she says the item has never been on the menu. So the woman is not even familiar with the menu... obviously new fine.. gave her some leeway.  I let her know that the item is actually listed in my favorites, we have ordered it a ridiculous amount of times in the past year alone.  She again states she doesn't have the combo.   Okay but you have wings....? -- ""Yeah"" and you have fingers....? -- ""Yeah""  Then what is the problem?--- ""You can't order them together."" Sure fine, no problem, but we still want the items...  it is only a 2.50 difference from your new menu (I checked their website by this time)  and her response was...  ""You can't order them together so you can call Eat24 and they will put your money back on your card""  Really?  Wow  That escalated rather quickly... I asked to speak with the manager and am told that he is unavailable. (yes he was standing right there within earshot of the phone when he responded).  UGH!!  SERIOUSLY! ?  Why oh WHY did I get sucked back in again? The carrot cake...so sad..so so sad.... I did it to myself thinking they were fixing their issues.   To quote the infamous, 'Fool me once, shame on ... shame on you. Fool me... You can't get fooled again!'  Anywho... I called Eat24.  They straightened it out.

"Let me first start by saying that the other location at Mercado is amazing! The River location had horrible food. We had take out and I will never go back. The fish tacos were doughy and soggy. The fish also did not taste fresh. It was smelly so we did not eat. The chicken tacos were dry, so dry. The rolled chicken tacos had no flavor and were dry.

"Fantastic burger joint in Dogtown!   The biggest drawback was the line. Waited nearly 2 hours just to order 2 burgers. Waiting in line is also a hassle too as the place is cramped and the line snakes around. The building itself is a little dark so trying to view the menu from far back in line can be difficult as well. If you have the patience to wait for over 1 hour for your meal, then I recommend giving it a try at least once.   The burgers themselves were nothing spectacular. They come in one, two, or three patty options for the regular burger or the specials come with two already. Their patties are super, super flat, so it was recommended to me that I get more than one patty (seems like a business ploy to pay for more than what you planned to, but idk lol). My brother got the pimento cheese burger which was delicious! The pimento cheese made the burger beyond phenomenal -- full of flavor and texture. I had the regular double cheese burger which was nothing extraordinary, but a good burger nonetheless.   This place was a good burger restaurant to try out. They're moving locations soon and I wonder if the food will be any different and if the service will be faster so that you don't have to wait 2 hours just to order... If you don't have to wait 2 hours in line, I highly recommend (or if you have nothing better to do with your night). If not, then I would suggest going somewhere else to eat.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"For the price point our expectation was pretty low. But our first night there we had someone rattling our doorknob intermittently and fairly loudly from about 3-5am, they never knocked or otherwise attempted to communicate with us and I ignored it. Eventually a motel employee came by with the master key and unlocked the door at about 5am, opened it to the ""chain"" bolt, shone a flashlight in my face then withdrew. Due to the thin walls I could clearly hear him radio to the front desk that the room was, in fact, occupied. Needless to say we did not get enough sleep.  Otherwise the room was what you'd expect for the price. It smelled like smoke, had a tiny shower, cheap sheets, burn holes in the blankets, the occasional bug, only two small thin towels, and was generally run down and not kept very clean.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 1.0
"I'm not sure what to think when the group I was with claims that they were close to exclaiming to a bar manager, ""You don't know who you're talking to! She is a very influential Yelper!"" Is that, like, Super-Elite status or something? Can I start getting paid for my reviews?  Anyway, I gots some thangs to say about Rhine Haus.  My boyfriend and two friends of ours checked this place out last night, after seeing it had randomly popped up in the 'hood and discussing how we've all wanted to check it out.   I wasn't quite sure what to think at first. What I immediately noticed is that I don't think the floor has been mopped. Ever. I didn't even know floors could get that sticky. Our friend's shoe literally came off her foot at one point as it stuck to the floor. How is that okay?! It's not. But the manager doesn't seem to know the difference between what is okay and what isn't, but I'll get to that in a sec.  I was expecting a German-themed pub by the name, but this place was some sort of Big Daddy's and Hot Shots mash-up. The bartenders were wearing tight t-shirts, skimpy booty shorts, and knee-high soccer socks, and there was a DJ spinning some dance/club/techno beats. Not what I was expecting, but it wasn't necessarily a bad thing.   The bartender was clearly new, for two reasons 1) she barely looked of age and 2) she was frazzled to the point of having a nervous breakdown. The funny thing is, yeah, they were busy, but the amount of stress she seemed to be having wasn't remotely warranted. I don't know if she thought moving at lightning speed and looking pissed off would make her look like she was working really hard or what, but it was quite the deterrent from a customer service standpoint.  For awhile, we were actually having a great time. I was going to give it a solid 3 stars. This place has darts, cornhole, and shuffleboard. We talked about how we might want to make it a regular spot, especially it being stumbling distance from Devin's apartment. And hey, they have great specials!  Too bad they completely dishonor those specials, talk down to you about it, and then threaten to call the cops if you don't leave.  The special that night was listed as ""Ladies drink free - open premium bar - 9:30-close, $5 cover."" They also advertised ""$1 burgers 5-7pm and 10-close."" It was on fliers in the bathroom and at the bar.  I have attached a photo of their ad in RFT for reference.  We ordered three burgers, and, ignoring the fact that when they came out, Little Miss Sunshine over there, promptly after she was handed the plates, exclaimed loudly, ""I DON'T KNOW WHOSE THE F*CK THESE ARE!"" - I eventually got my burgers and greatly enjoyed them. The burgers had great flavor, and the fries were to die for. Winner. Happy camper here.  At the end of the night, our group of four was served up couple of checks that totaled about $120. Say, WHAT?!  First of all, they charged us $9 apiece for the burgers. Bartender copped quite a bitchitude with Devin about it, and then got the owner of the place involved. He told us the $1 burgers were supposed to be sliders. Bartender claimed Devin had ordered ""Three classic burgers with fries."" Considering we didn't even know that was a menu option, this is clearly false. The owner told us it is apparently our ""responsibility"" that when we get three full sized burgers we need to ""speak up"" about it. We claimed we hadn't been here before and we didn't know what the $1 burgers were supposed to look like, and his condescending response was to ""use common sense."" How about you can safely assume that someone who orders ""three burgers"" on $1 burger night wants the ONE DOLLAR BURGERS. He eventually took the burgers off the bill because we weren't budging.  The next order of business was the drinks my female friend and I had ordered that we were charged for. They claimed the wristband ended at midnight. There were several attempts to discuss with the owner their fliers all over the place that claimed free drinks until close, but all he kept saying was, ""I'm done. I did you a favor"" - DID US A ""FAVOR?!"" - ""by comping the burgers, but I am done talking to you about this."" I kept trying to show him the flier, multiple times, and he eventually conceded that it was a ""typo,"" but then said, ""Now get out. You are no longer welcome here. You are trespassing on private property and if you don't leave, I will call the cops.""  Not exactly the friendly neighborhood bar where everyone knows your name, eh?  F*ck this place sideways, man. There is only one place I know of that beats this place for Worst Customer Service Ever, and that is Black Thorn, but this place ain't far behind.

"The extras are the star of this show! The Bakersfield margarita and the fresh guacamole made the experience. My friends and I all got margaritas and shared the guacamole. For all the super-food avocado maniacs out there, I hate to break it to you, but I cannot sit down and enjoy an avocado. This guac totally changed my prospective. It is amazing! I could have just ordered chips and guac and been satisfied. It is seriously that good!  I ordered the Milanesa for my main course and it was pretty yummy! The waitress told my friend and I to split one, but we were both pretty hungry and didn't take her advice. I currently have the other half of my sandwich in my fridge because it was a ton of food.  We sat on the main floor and didn't fill a table, so the waitress asked us if we would mind sharing our table with another party. We agreed...throwing a few ransoms into your meal makes things interesting. Unfortunately, one person in the couple that sat with us complained the whole time. Luckily, my friends and I were enjoying our margaritas enough that we could ignore (or make fun of her) without it really being a problem.

"My husband and I have been here three times.  Once was for an event with a set menu and private room and twice for dinner.  The portions are good and the food is typically well executed.  The menu is very basic american; nothing exceptional and very typical compared to the other early american inns in the area such as Kimberton or Dilworthtown.  I can't say that I've had a dish that we just outright didn't like.  If you go on a weeknight, the place is usually not well-attended so service is good and sitting in one of the front rooms is charming and cozy.  One of our dinners was on a Saturday night when things were busier.  They put us in the back of the restaurant.  The back has a completely different ambiance than the front.  Whereas the front is intended to be early american/rustic, the back is cheap and tacky and doesn't look like it's been renovated since the 1980's.  If I recall correctly, it was some sort of a nautical theme.  It's the type of place you would expect to dine at down the shore.  It was pretty awful and the ambiance just stinks.  They also seemed to forget about us back there; service was very slow.  My in-laws have complained terribly about the service on a Saturday night so it seems to be a recurring problem for them.  The wine list is not that great; lower quality wines that don't reflect the prices of the food and the type of place they seem to want to be.  Overall, I would recommended they manage their house better on the weekends and they really need to overhaul the back and their wine list.  Honestly, I would not dine there again if the back is all they offered me.  Be sure to make a reservation and ask for a seat in the front.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"As native Nashvillians, we've had Moto on our list of restaurants for a long time but just hadn't made it here yet until last Saturday's date night. For a tab of almost $200 before tip, I would have expected a much better overall experience. Food was either incredibly bland or inedibly salty. Service was good other than a ridiculous wait for cocktails (our food came before our drinks). Food however was subpar at best. Octopus - almost inedible salt levels masked any natural flavors. Scallops -  $30 for 3 scallops on a plate with garnishes; little flavor other than raw grapefruit slices. Tagliatelle Bolognese tasted like a blander version of moms spaghetti and the noodles did not appear freshly made. Brussels - overly seasoned with vinegar and a sugary/salty/oily mess. Again natural flavor was masked by heavy uses of cheap salt and sugar.

"Stopped by BBC for some sushi and saki last night with a few friends.  I was really confused upon actually walking into the place the ambiance is just strange....you'd think it was just your standard sushi place with modern decor, but the cheap disco lights and hookahs threw me off a bit.  And rap music.  There was a lot of rap music.  A server greeted us pretty quickly and took our drink order.  Another random employee came over to explain the sushi menu/make recommendations.  Once he was done with his explanation, he promptly seated himself with some other patrons and started talking to them, taking pictures, etc.  His behavior was so erratic while we were there, it's a pretty safe guess that he wasn't quite sober.  Between the four of us, we ordered a menage a trois and five different sushi rolls.  We were one of two tables in the restaurant side; there were probably 6-7 people at the bar.  By no means crowded for a Saturday night.  That being said, it literally took 35 minutes for our food to arrive--our server apologized.  The kitchen staff came out and said it would be about another 5-10 minutes.  Then the less-than-sober server came back to our table, and told us they were out of the avocado tepanyaki.   When our food finally did show up, everything was quite tasty.  But overall, the strange server, the long wait, and the odd atmosphere is enough to make me not want to go back.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 2.0

"Get baited in by going to Bait! I'm hooked! I was blown away by the classy decor immediately when I entered and saw the hostess station and the dining room. This is a definite date night place. The cool listening sounds of jazz & R&B created an ambiance of a high-class restaurant. The food and service didn't disappoint and maintained the high-quality experience the decor demanded.   My server George was great. His recommendations were excellent and I must say the uniform of the male servers were different and I loved it. The jeans made it casual and unpretentious, but the tucked in collared shirts under fitted vests gave it a neat and classy look. He recommended the lobster salad and I enjoyed it and it was a substantial portion with lots of lobster claw meat on top. It's rare you see a  restaurant use heirloom watermelon radish on a salad, and I was impressed the chef would choose it. Also the dressing was light and complimentary to the salad, not thick and overpowering which was perfect for me. Most people pair lemon with lobster but the addition of orange in the salad was a pleasant surprise.   I chose to order the lobster fries (how could I NOT?!) and the Thai chili wings. They were OUTSTANDING!  The Thai chili chicken wings came out first, beautifully plated and piping hot. The chicken wing segments were perfectly fried and seasoned and the chili sauce they were tossed in was delicious! Bait did a great job having non-fish and seafood options for those who may not like or have an allergy, and the Thai chili wings makes this a destination for anyone who loves a good appetizer of chicken wings.   And the definite show stopper was the lobster fries. Do NOT leave here without an order of lobster fries! The small but substantial order had lots of lobster meat and a lemon sauce that was perfect for the lobster and fries pairing. Topped with parsley and micro greens, the plating was picture perfect. Thin fries were perfectly fried and if you have to share these, order 2 orders. They are not for sharing!   I ended my meal with the housemade bananas foster, which was a little non traditional but was good. A whole banana was sliced lengthwise and Creme brûlée'd and came with a crackable caramelized topping on which 2 small scoops of butter pecan ice cream sat on top of. Not drowned in ice cream! Thank you! Under the bananas was cooked fresh pineapple and strawberries that were sautéed and drizzled with that traditional rum caramel sauce that was delicious. The addition of pineapples and strawberries made it a great fruit dessert that I enjoyed.   Please support this new small business! The owner, who I was privileged to overhear doing his St. Louis Magazine interview, is a young entrepreneur with a background in medical and  real estate and this is his first restaurant, which you can tell he put a lot of thought and efforts to launch. This beautiful historic home on Lindell he renovated to launch Bait alone is a show-stopping experience. He mentions his personal love of seafood and wanting to bring a high class seafood experience to St. Louis and I think he has done a good job----his first-time effort should be supported. I am not much of a drinker so I can't speak on the cocktail menu mix he has, but the cocktail menu and impressive glass wine wall shows if you are someone who enjoys libations with your meal, they have some options that may work for you.   They even bring your leftovers to the table in a high-class way! George brought my leftover salad in a plastic container topped with a fresh flower. Nice touch! They also bring your check in a book! That was a cool way of presenting a check that I have not seen before. Note: you DON'T keep the book.   My only recommendation is to create a more diverse dessert program because I was looking for a show-stopping house-made signature dessert to match the food. As a new restaurant, I appreciate them focusing on making a phenomenal apps and entree menu and getting that right, but as this restaurant continues to grow and carve out its place in the St. Louis food scene, I think a great dessert program with a house made signature cake, pie, or housemade cheesecake and a chocolate dessert for the chocolate lovers (I am not a chocolate dessert person but I appreciate its presence as an option on a dessert menu) could easily increase average check at this restaurant in the long term.   Thanks for a great experience George! Also, It was great meeting the FOH manager Misha who is responsible for the perfect music mix playlist and thanks to the owner for understanding the importance of connecting with the customers. I had 2 table touches by the owner himself during my visit. I look forward to going back again soon.   Since my visit, I was happy to see they have started a happy hour with discounted drinks and apps.

"I'm giving them a two for this stay. I stayed one other time: June 2015 and things were fine.  This time:  September 2015 my family stayed for several days and experienced apathy from most of the staff.  They were understaffed for weekend breakfasts, so garbage was overflowing and several people went without the eggs and sausage.  One waffle maker left the waffle raw in the middle.  Mostly we were disappointed with housekeeping.  One evening we came back to unmade beds and full garbage.  We informed the desk and were given a new garbage liner by request.  That's it.  No one came to finish the room and no compensation was offered.  :(.  On another day the door was crashed into very loudly; not a bump.  It made us all jump and I saw a maid pulling away with her cart.  My husband saw a maid help herself to the breakfast.  We averaged $119/night for apathetic service, but comfortable beds, decent food when available and clean rooms if housekeeping finishes the job.  We moved to another hotel for the remainder if our trip.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 2.0

"PLEASE READ THIS & BE THOUGHTFUL BEFORE RENTING A ROOM HERE!!!!   Where do you want me to start?  We can only run 3 things or the electric pops....very dangerous, the carpet is so offensive that I can't imagine that what're is underneath and freshly painted walls would go a very very long way.  We were in an efficiency unit :(  It was so gross in there that we either wore shoes or socks at all times and reported said issues at front desk!!!  Our bathroom light wouldn't work most of the time so that meant showering in the dark.  The dust, dirt & who knows what else that were behind the Murphy bed had me sneezing & wheezing all 4 days.   Our refrigerator only stayed cold on the top shelf and our blinds were missing so many slats that I had to fashion paper towel into replacement blinds.  Our window leaked during a torrential rain storm on Christmas Eve....  NOT ONCE did we receive any housekeeping what's so ever.  We had to report to front desk for clean towels and no one would take our wet dirty towels or empty our trash.   The 'owners' units were very clean & updated and I watched them clean  for over 2 hours in the unit across from us... which would leave to believe that the individual owners of said gross & filthy units could give a shit less as long as people like me rent them!!!!  We had 4 others in our group that had the same issues in their 2 bedroom unit on ground floor. While sitting on their balcony I looked up only to find that the unit directly above on the 2nd floor had no 2x6's even screwed in any of the other boards...1 of the 2x6's was missing about 2 inches of its connection due to rot!   If North Reddington beach inspection office were smart they would come in and do a complete top to bottom inspection along with an electrical inspection.

"My friend and I stopped at this place to eat something new. She's been here before, but I haven't. I never tried the pho, because honestly, I can go to a PHO restaurant and eat a nice good traditional bowl. The menu is pretty limited, and nothing really caught my attention. My friend and I ordered the lemon grass chicken, glazed pork belly bowl, and fried oysters and two boba teas. The boba teas were alright , kind of pricey for their size and nothing special. The oysters were also nothing special, just fried oysters with a bit of garnish and sauce that I can barely taste, so nothing that I would remember. The chicken wings were VERY good. Probably one of the best I've eaten, but certainly not the absolute best. The sauce is a bit sticky, but it's nice and a bit sweet with that lemon grass flavor hint. The bowl was .. Kinda disappointing. The greens in it were a bit rough, and the bowl itself just kind of lacked in flavor. The bowl presented itself nicely and all, but I definitely wouldn't get it again.  It's an alright and casual place to go to to enjoy some untraditional Asian food, but nothing here is going to bring me back, but I wasn't disappointed overall in the place.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"A fun, free educational tour for all ages.   If in St. Louis I think a trip to tour Budweiser is a must.  The tour starts with the Clydesdale's & Dalmatians, which is a great outdoors spot for some photos.  You are then quickly guided through the plant where you are right smack in the middle of where your beer is brewed & beach wood aged.  The tour moves quickly & is very informative.  At the end of the tour there is two free glasses of beer (I tried the Land Shark beer, and enjoyed it), hand poured by the fine folks of Budweiser served with free pretzels.  Don't worry parents, there is pop for the kids & I'm not sure if any of the previous reviews mentioned this tour is FREE!!! Lol.

"This place is awesome! I used to eat at the Rutherford Grill up in the Napa Valley every day like it was my own kitchen. When Honor Bar came to Santa Barbara, I felt at home.  I've eaten at Honor Bar several times for different reasons. The service has been on point every time - pleasant, attentive, and consistent. Since I grew up working in restaurants, it's difficult for me to let go and enjoy the experience without brutally identifying even the smallest nuances of an environment a restaurant provides. Honor Bar nails it on the head with even the tiniest details. Most diners wouldn't notice the care and attention to details...but someone like me always does. Let's be honest, you've got to hand it to Honor Bar for not only impressing me once, but doing so every time.  I was just in here eating lunch with my friend. We were celebrating a special accomplishment, and thought Honor Bar would be the best environment.   This time was extra special and more memorable than my other experiences with this restaurant. Our server, Paige not only nailed the mechanics of quality service (and doing so without deviating from  the company guidelines of service), she actually WANTED to give us a great experience - and she displayed beautifully. Her personality filled in the gaps not even the tightest operational systems can accomplish. To put it plainly, she put the heartbeat into our experience.  I rarely get to sit back, relax and enjoy restaurants best definition of quality service without the inner condescending thoughts towards the servers - or the establishment. When it's a system like Honor Bar has, and a personality like Paige's, you really get to enjoy what Honor Bar has to offer - without any internal judgmental conversations.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I'm always wary of restaurants in malls.  I guess that makes me snooty.  However, my snootiness pales in comparison to that of the wait staff and some of the patrons of this establishment.  Snootalicious!  I think this is a chicken/egg argument, though.  I mean, imagine you were a server working at an expensive restaurant at Plaza Frontenac.  Imagine all the exhausted plastics who've spent hours laboring through the mall, spending, spending, spending, who are now starving because they haven't eaten in three days and are cranky rich people who just want their food, dammit.  Imagine confronting that and combating it with your own level of snootiness, just to sort of level the playing field (even though it doesn't level anything at all, really, except the depths we humans fall to when we feel belittled)...  I imagine that's why the servers are snooty at Cardwell's... which is really too bad because sometimes the folks who dine at Cardwell's are sweet and friendly and down-to-earth as can be, and they're somewhat taken aback by the service.  We were invited to join our extended family here and I was pretty surprised by the lack of personality and the chilliness of our servers considering this is a ""nice"" restaurant.  A smile can go a long way, people.  Give it a try.  So.  Now you know how I feel about the service.  That'll cost you stars, Cardwell's.  Luckily , the food is pretty darn good.  While I wasn't completely won over by my trout, the vegetable sides (mashed sweet potatoes, garlicky broccolini and spaghetti squash) were quite tasty.  Justin's crispy duck, red cabbage and butternut squash ravioli were delicious.  The profiteroles dessert with house-made cappuccino ice cream was good, but I was more interested in the accompanying caramel sauce and berries than the actual dessert.  The lemon sorbet was WHOA lemony--almost like lemon-fresh Pine-sol.  Yowsers!  That stuff would put a sour, snooty look on anyone's face!  And for my last snarky comment, I hate that they allow smoking at the bar because it's not like the bar is in a separate room or anything and the entire dining area gets all stinky.  Yuck.  And what's with the TV?  It's a nice restaurant, not a sports bar!  For the price, I think you can do better in St. Louis.  Yes, the food is good, but the atmosphere isn't particularly outstanding, the service isn't terrif and it's just flat-out expensive for the all-around experience.  2.5 stars, but I'm rounding up because I still enjoyed myself--I had great company and I wasn't buying!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

The day went on fine,but for whatever reason my group of 6 were taken to the makeup bar instead of the eclipse but i specifically booked eclipse.once it was time to pay, i was charged and extra $100 for using the facility,which we weren't since we were getting ready at our house,all we wanted was hair and makeup and this was discussed many times.we were charged $100 which was automatically used as a tip for the stylists.overall i was charged an extra 230$incorrectly, and since i booked for my big day i didnt want to argue and just left after i paid.the makeup did not last 24hr like we were told, my makeup was gone by 10pm,and party was going until 1am.jacquelin the makeup artist could have smiled at times at least,she didnt seem to like her job at all,the 2 hair stylists were adorable and talkative.overall this place is a rip off,and used my good mood as a backlash to charge me in over $230 extra for things we didnt request or use.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 1.0
"Ordered 2 chicken cheesesteak hoagies.   Received 2 chicken cheesesteaks.  Called for new sandwiches and was sent lettuce and tomato in a box to put on my cold sandwiches myself, bc I didn't just pay for someone else to do the work.   Called again and was told the person who answered the phone wrote down chicken cheesesteak nothing about a hoagie, like it was my fault.   So I asked for my money back and they asked for the food back.  Like what are you doing with the food.  Finally had to drive up myself to come home with 15 bucks after spending 31 and all we ate were cheese fries, so had to be mean and take back my tip...let them eat it.

"Average Korean food with nice decor and inconsistent service.  Probably still the best option in Center City though.  Good(s): Aged kimchee + pork jungol - Perfect flavor and done up big (enough for 3-4 people to share). Banchan - Fresh and colorful side dishes  Bad(s): 25 minutes between visits from my waitress **there were only 2 other tables with customers, hello!** Spanish Mackerel - the fish was seriously funky and while they did take it back, the manager decided that was the time to tell me about how fresh the fish is and how they break it down, etc.  The fish was stinking.

"Whether You are buying a small gift or expanding you garden this is a great place to go.  Cactus is not inexpensive and you can spend 75.00 on two plants. Or 600. On four.  Or, buy smaller ones for 12.00 each. All of which there are many selections.   I like the unusual and odd cactus and I found one. My wife wanted one larger with new  Starts in the same pot. Found that too.  Every sale gets a 2x2 young cactus as a gift.  They prepare your buy for your vehicle. Ours got a new box, another family had the plant wrapped in cardboard with a bamboo stake to keep it steady.  They have wandering sales people that love cactus and can offer advice. Ie.  Full sun, Partial shade , where the mark is to face south whether or not planting.  Cactus are directional and like to be orei They also give you a care and planting sheet to add to your education.   My plan was to get four plants for fifty and I wound up with two for seventy due to type and size.

He walks us into the room points to our table and tells us to go have a seat & he will bring us menus in a minute (he had menus in his hand). Needless to say he never brought us a menu. 10 minutes later waitress comes by to get drink order and then went to get us menus. Waitress Janette Z only came by to get drink order, food order & bring us the bill. She never checked about our drinks- yes our glasses were dry.

"I don't understand why this place has such a high rating. I was on a trip in Edmonton and came to this place for dinner mostly because of its high rating on Yelp. I got there at around 7 and the place was pretty full. I sat down, ordered my Pho (house special), and waited for literally like 20 minutes with my table being empty except for the tea (they had pretty decent tea though). I was wondering why it took so long and raised my hand to ask. The lady saw me and probably realized that she forgot my order or something and quickly went back in the kitchen. She then got me the bean sprout like a normal Pho place would and went back in the kitchen. And then I realized that they use lemon instead of LIME for their Pho. That's when I got really disappointing and knew that this place is nothing special. And just as expected, my bowl of noodle came and it was ok in size, not the best though because I ordered the large for like $11 or something which was quite expensive compared to other places. It tasted average, the soup was pretty bad though as it lacked a lot of flavors in my opinion.  Overall, there are definitely better options and this place in my opinion is very overrated.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

If I was blindfolded and was asked what I was eating, I honestly couldn't tell you it was pizza, at all. Their pizza game is definitely not on point.

The last time I was there, I asked if I could have bacon added to my cheese fries and she flat out told me no, it's too late. The food is already made. I started looking at the menu and noticed pricing was the same so I asked once again and she said, no. Looked at my receipt and then feeling it wasn't too much to ask since I was still waiting on pizza and offering to pay difference of $.50, I asked a third time and she got really huffy puffy abt it. I basically said, you can't just throw some bacon on top?! She finally took my $ and did but I couldn't believe what a big deal it was. It took two secs!

"Most DSW's are pretty similar to each other, and I agree with Allison B's review that says that this is a typical one.  I also have found the employees here to be consistently friendly and courteous!  I find this place very hit-or-miss.  It also tends to be more expensive than I might expect.  I don't buy shoes here unless they're on clearance or it's a particular model/color that I absolutely can't find elsewhere for cheaper.  There are other retail shoe stores out there (like the one on 40th street in Philly) that have brand new shoes (not reject outlet selections) for a larger discount than this store has them.  I also sometimes come in this store and just don't find anything I want.  Like, I like colorful sneakers, and once I came in here and it was full of color, but then other times I've been in here and it's just been a sea of drab grays.  I really like the sock selection, but they are expensive.  I have sometimes seen the same brands of socks for sale here cheaper at department stores, like Sears.  The location is convenient for car access.  It's pretty inaccessible by other means though--not really near anything by walking.  I don't like the layout of the immediate surrounding--this store is in a shopping plaza that is sequestered off from the neighboring residential area...almost the opposite of the old-school ""main street"" style shopping strips that I really love...and in my opinion, the worst example of suburban design.  So I do think this place is contributing to the sea of suburban sprawl that, in my opinion, decreases the quality of life for those living in the northern suburbs.  If I were to improve this store, for people with my tastes, I'd suggest (a) lowering the prices a tad (b) stocking more colorful, minimal, comfy men's casual sneakers--that's usually what I'm looking for (c) doing something to redesign the physical environment around this shopping plaza in the long-run, moving towards a more sustainable, walkable sort of design that creates the feeling of a real place rather than just an isolated strip mall in generic suburban sprawl.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 3.0

"I can justifiably accuse this airline of false advertising.  Southwest is as money hungry as any other airline and even more so as I explain.  Each year I am one of the 5500+ participants in the Philly Livestrong Challenge raising money and awareness for victims who are fighting for their lives every day.  This airline does not recognize the need to fight cancer nor the efforts of the fund raising event participants and essentially takes money from the charitable 501(c)3 Livestrong Foundation to benefit it's own profit margin.  In their unethical behavior, they took donations earmarked to benefit cancer patients to pay themselves for an easily waived baggage fee of $50, discouraging participation in this fund raising cycling event.  Of course SWA is not obligated in any way to waive certain fees to help the fight against cancer but their advertising campaigns would falsely lead patrons to believe that they are an ethical company.

So getting past all of that the Theater itself is very nice.  Comfortable leather reclining chairs and not a bad seat in the house. One plus is that they also offer reserved seating online for most shows.  Especially during new releases. High five on that!  The downside to that is that not everyone understands that some shows have reserved seating.  When you get to your seat you might find someone sitting in it. For the first 15 minutes of the movie start the attendant spent time rearranging everyone which was a bit distracting.  Why so confusing you ask?

My friends and I met up on a GORGEOUS summer day - not a cloud in the sky! Heritage is very open and airy so it was the perfect brunch spot. They had left the front door and floor to ceiling windows open which brought in a lot of natural light. They had a live band playing which really livened up the mood and made for some wonderful entertainment! I believe they have a band playing every Sunday for brunch which is definitely something to keep in mind. :)  My girlfriend and I split the Pulled Pork Hash and the Flapjack for our meals. To be honest, I wasn't really impressed with the Pulled Pork Hash. I felt like all of the components in this entree didn't really compliment each other. The Flapjack however was an unexpected winner! We had originally asked for the Dutch Baby, but sadly they were all out for the day. Our kind waitress told us our next best bet for something sweet was the Flapjack. For a lack of other options, we got it. I wasn't really expecting much out of it, but I ended up thoroughly enjoying it. The house preserves and brown sugar butter really upped the level of a regular old pancake.

"I chose to have my wedding in Philadelphia and chose the Loews hotel to house all of our guests.  Since I currently live in NY and my husband's family is from NY as well, we had a lot of out-of-town guests.  The hotel was pretty helpful in the booking period, and the prices were one of the best prices for the type of hotel we were looking for.  They were able to give my mom a hotel room across the hall from the bridal suite (even though she booked last minute) without hesitation.  The hotel is in the heart of the city, so it was convenient location-wise.  You are right by Reading Terminal and a few blocks away from CVS if you accidentally forgot some toiletries.  The hotel is beautiful and many of our guests were impressed.  The bell hops and staff are extremely friendly and courteous. I would give the service 5 stars.  They even gave us great restaurant recommendations for my fiancee and I since we were staying an extra night.  My only issue is that we were unable to book the bridal suite for the night of my actual wedding (just the night before/day of) and we were told that they would move our stuff into our ""wedding night"" suite.  My fiancee and I had separate rooms but they were to move both of our stuff that night, without any issues.  Unfortunately, when we got back to the hotel after our wedding, our stuff was not there.  The staff was apologetic and it was corrected right away, but we ended up getting charged for two nights which was not fun to deal with on our honeymoon.  Other than this set back, I would still highly recommend this hotel.  I will always associate the best day of my life with the Loews.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 4.0

"Peppermill has extensive variety of rooms and restaurants. Tuscan-inspired resort hotel offering plush quarters & eclectic dining, plus a nightclub & a casino. Dealers and pit bosses are the best! Huge diversity in staff as well as games.  They also have a party room if you planing a party for kids. The place is ... Game Lab is a big arcade located on the 3rd floor. Pools, waterfall, huge spas.  I even played craps and found out my dice skills are lacking. If you want to give this a try..I recommend you do it in the early evening when there's less people. Dealers can and will assist your betting. Also it's not as fast, customers expect beginners and can take a joke .  Every 21 dealer I had was great not burned out. Very professional.  I try to play with them. As a handicap woman traveling alone I have nobody rooting for me but the pit Boss and the dealer it's nice they are very supportive.  I imagine it can be a little boring for them to feel fresh daily, so I bet with them sometimes.  Let's talk about cocktail waitresses. You are not going to wait, they are there on the spot nearly as you sit. I always tip them they're on their feet all day working through this pandemic. Usually cost of drinks very in the different restaurants, lounges and bars so I figure a dollar is reasonable whether I'm winning or losing. Let's talk about baggage handlers. Most patrons don't understand this Resort has a computer system that rotates, fairly distributes the work. I'm sure most customers don't know so I'm going to mention it. I do tip on arrival, then again to drop off person. Both are important jobs. I usually take everything from my car so there's usually three-  five bags. Varying in sizes a dollar for each is what I do. I take everything out of my car always. Never know when you might need something it's worth the buck a bag. My stay was in the Tuscany Tower thanks to David Fuller.  It's a modern glass structure, reflecting sun and sky from outside. Inside the room was classic style of Tuscan luxury. Warm colors evoke rolling green Italian hillsides. As you walk in it even has relaxing music. Plush hotel room interiors offer peace and comfort. I was able to enjoy the Jacuzzi bathtub handles on both sides, telephone in the bathroom gives you the confidence to try and I highly recommend. I felt secure these are handicapped safe rooms. You feel like you need a handicap stool just go ahead, call they're happy to bring one up.  Last but not least, Peppermill features an easy and convenient airport shuttle, which departs from the valet area outside the Hotel Lobby, and runs every half-hour beginning at 4:30am. It goes to the international airport if you're flying out of a different airport you might want to ask for consideration on that but there's plenty of taxis in Ubers you shouldn't have any problems getting to any destination from this conveniently located hotel. I had a marvelous time. I highly recommend. Huge hotel with thousands of people, with thousands of people, comes thousands of personalitys. Signs are posted where you can smoke. Masks must be worn expect to be reminded. No rules will be broken.  Security is absolutely there for your assistance. They are highly trained specialist. Can answer questions, don't hesitate to ask.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 5.0

They were very dry and hard - when you take one bit, it all falls apart. I also got one that looked terrible - hallow showing all around. If I was a baker here, I would not sell this when I am charging about $3 each. Wouldn't have been terrible if the macarons tasted good but they did not.

"This was the worst experience I've ever had in all my years renting a vehicle. I have never been treated so terribly by an establishment. In a nut shell, I called and made a reservation at 5p for a rental  at the location 5 minutes from my job so I could pick it up on my break really quickly. I was called at 5:20pm and told that they couldn't service me because they have no more vehicles to rent and that I would have to go to the Philadelphia pike location ,which is 25 minutes away, before 6pm if I want a car today. When I asked why, I was told because of the time no one could bring a car to the location I made a reservation at, instead I would have to be inconvenienced and drive all the way there. I'm sorry but wouldn't it take the same amount of time for a vehicle to be driven to this location i had reservations at verses me driving to Philadelphia pike. So basically, they rather inconvenience me, the customer, instead of one of their employees being inconvenienced because they want to go home at 6pm. Wen I got to Philadelphia pike, the manager name Dewey helped me. I asked him why i had to be inconvenienced and drive there and he told be ""Do I realize what time I made my reservation. You made your reservation at the LAST MINUTE so theirs nothing he could do about it. I was upset because he repeated several times as well as a young lady that was new , they both repeated to me at least 10 times that i made a LAST MINUTE reservation and their reservation system isn't real time so there's no way for them know what vehicles are where.  I was also asked for a $400 deposit, but my reservations that were emailed to me said a deposit of $250. The manager said there was nothing he could do about that as well. I had a manager who clearly saw how upset i was and did absolutely nothing.  I didn't even get an apology until I asked for one,  I had to actually say, the least you could do is acknowledge your errors and apologize. Only then I received an apology.

"I've been to this Matt the Miller's location about five times over the past several years, and unfortunately each time it seems to get a bit worse. Let's start with the parking, which is absolutely horrific. There is a small covered parking garage underneath the shopping center, but good luck finding any spots there. There is also some parallel street parking on both Rangeline and City Center, but given the amount of shops and restaurants in this area, there are rarely any spots there either. Your best bet is to park in either strip mall across Rangeline or City Center, however the spots in these lots are technically only for the patrons of the respective strip malls, not the Carmel City Center businesses, which houses Matt the Miller's.  Let's move on to the menu. I remember when this place first opened, the menu was pretty extensive, I'd say a good 2-3 pages of options to flip through. Not anymore though, as now everything is on one single page. And to add to the disappointment, the available options seem pretty limited.  Now let's move on to the food. We got the pretzel bites as an appetizer. It comes with 9-10 deep fried pretzels, which is enough to feed the table. However, the sauces to dip them in are so runny that it makes sharing very difficult. As you try to spoon out some dip onto your plate, it inevitably drips all the way across the table making a mess.  For an entree I ordered the cuban panini and sweet potato fries. The panini has carnitas, ham, swiss cheese, pickles and honey mustard. It arrived pretty quick, but the sandwich was lukewarm. The disappointment continued.  I will say that the service was A+ and our waitress was very friendly. However, given the myriad of other restaurant options in the midtown and downtown Carmel area, I left telling myself it would be the last time I dine at Matt the Miller's.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Fries are well seasoned, and you get plenty with your meal. For my 2 sauces, I chose the Donkey sauce and Buttermilk ranch. Both were ok, but nothing exceptional.   I visited with 2 friends, and we all agree the meals are good, but not the best chicken tenders you can find in town. They're selection of sauces is unmatched, and the price point is good for lunch. A solid 3 stars.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I could have sworn I reviewed this particular location but after checking my Center City review, I realize...I never did.   When this was considered the newer 'Pavilion' side of the mall (I'm not sure if that word even exists for this mall anymore) I used to walk by Morton's on the first floor when I was trying to get to XandO (or I think it was called Cosi by then.)* It was just a solid closed door and for some reason, I was intimidated by this. So when one of my co-workers way back when asked if I would like to join her and another co-worker here for dinner on her gift card, I jumped at the chance to finally walk through that door.   The three of us managed to grab a nice leather banquette and I'm pretty sure everyone surrounding us was male, in suits, settling in after a long day of work. I'm happy to say we were doing the same, and it felt good.   Even better, a friend was our server for the evening, and she made sure we were well taken care of. One of us ordered Steak Diane, a filet mignon, and yes, I had chicken. We split three sides and pretty much demolished everything in sight, if not daintily. I do believe we ordered that hot chocolate molten lava cake (I can't even get the name correct but we enjoyed this) and we sat back and relaxed after we feasted.   Damn, I miss the days when I made good money, even though this was on a gift card.   *I should point out the time line for this visit was 2004-5 or so when I know these places existed.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

This is more of a hipster comic book shop. Lots of indie comic books and magazines and a wonderful collection of mainstream comics. The staff knows their stuff and are very friendly.

"First time eating here for a quick bite after one of my Real Estate appointments in Fishtown. I love diners, and this place was perfect. The two things I look for in a diner are quick service, and friendly staff. Mugshot has them both!   The whole point of going to a diner is to have some breakfast food that reminds you of home, and the staff made me feel like I was an everyday regular. I had the Insomnia sandwich, which was so good I devoured the first half before I got a picture.

Rooms are big and looks like each one has a balcony. Some facing the pool area while others face the parking lot, but nice to have the outdoor space either way. They look exactly as the pictures posted here.  Towels need help, bed is a little hard for my taste. Came equipped with a fridge and coffee maker. No microwave for those leftovers you bring back to the room, you have to go down to lobby to use theirs. No good restaurants nearby.  For most part, it's what I expected for a Courtyard. Not a 5 star, but not terrible at all. It served it's purpose while in town for a soccer tournament. Would stay again.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 4.0

"If you are looking a cheap place to stay with reasonable accommodation's, I highly suggest St. Vincent's.  This old orphanage has tons of character, large rooms, and very friendly staff.  However, if you are not used to a few extra guests in your room (aka roaches) you might wanna try somewhere else.  Upon arriving to St. Vincent we were greeted with a smile and our room key waiting.  The room was very spacious with private bath but was roasting.  I turned on the AC hoping it would cool off by the evening, but when we returned it was still stifling.  The next day I asked for a new room and was granted one with functional AC rather quickly.  They were a few roach corpses laying around the new room, but we decided it was better than waking up drenched in sweat each morning.    All-n-all it was a great experience.

"The best burgers in St. Louis. For my money Blueberry Hill comes close, but O'Connell's takes it hands down. Inexpensive, thick, cooked perfectly with only a slice of onion and pickle. Maybe you can get more toppings but in my opinion that would be a mistake. Get an O'Connell's Ale on draft (made especially for them by the brewmeisters at Schlafly), a side of fries and enjoy. Doesn't get much better than this. Located in what looks like a 19th century building, ambiance is dark, antique, and cozy.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 5.0

They said ""I don't think my manager will let me"".  I said, ""I'll go somewhere else"", and they wait ""are you sure?""  They didn't even attempt to seat me.

"You have to give it four stars because of what it is and what it represents.  It is a very traditional restaurant located in a long-standing and famous hotel.  Everything is to a very high level of quality.  The food is excellent.  The servers are professional and ask all the right questions to make sure you get what you want.  We found the service slow but that may have been because we were a group of 11 most of whom were riding in a long (104 miles) bike tour the following morning and ordered the same pasta dish.  I guess that many of the other diners were also cyclists and ordered the same meal  (the kitchen may have had someone run to the store to get enough pasta).  The pasta, when it arrived, was wonderful.  We were put in a side room which does not have the same charm and ambiance as the main dining room.

"I needed fresh produce yesterday to make my Chicken Escarole Soup and needed to stay close to home so decided to stop in to Verchios's to see if they had what I needed, most importantly the Escarole!  Lol.   There were absolutely NO PARKING SPOTS available!!  Seriously, hubby had to park us in the dirt along a line of other customers who apparently ran into the same problem.    Omg, if you think parking in South Philly is bad (like around the Italian Market), well this was worse!  My anxiety was so off the charts, I had to close my eyes & start praying bc it was like a death trap pulling in & out with everyone driving at you like you're not even there!  Anyway, when you walk in it's like a big cold Wharehouse, including that hard cement floor. In front of you are rows of fresh produce, fruit, herbs and vegetables while to your right is a deli which was packed with ppl lining all the way out door. It smelled really good though.   The aisles are a little tight and packed so unless you know where your items are located, you pretty much have to go in each to see what they have. Luckily, I found what I needed and even saw some I would normally grab but being so crowded, it was clearly not a day to take your time...the shoppers & their kids were  running around, grabbing & going, lol!!  Checkout was surprisingly easy & quick!!  No problems at all. Cashiers were very friendly!    Prices were pretty decent, especially if you compare to supermarkets!    The 9th Street Italian Market is still my favorite and number one place to go (prices, sizes, variety & freshness can't be beat) but if I can't make it over the bridge, I'd definitely come here (on a day the parking lot isn't a mobbed, lol).   4 Stars from me",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

The parking lot is huge and although there's construction, it isn't too difficult to get here. The sushi is amazing. They have wild game. There is a large vegan selection in the frozen aisle past the wine area.   I can't wait to come again and buy sushi, the chocolate dessert cup, and cannolis.

DBA is probably the bar I like the best on Frenchmen as they have a great beer selection and they usually have some of the best music.  I think their beers are overpriced for New Orleans but other than that I've usually had a good time here.  There is usually a good crowd in here but it is rarely so crazy crowded that you can't get a good spot to watch the band.  The bartenders are usually pretty quick and efficient and I've rarely had bad service.  Always a good mix of locals and tourists so there is almost always the opportunity to meet new and interesting people.

"My girlfriend and I were excited to come to this place. It was our second time coming to Tampa, the first time we were here we tried to walk in to this place and it was super packed, so we decided not to wait. This time around we made a reservation the day before, because we wanted to enjoy the beautiful beach side seating. However, when we arrived, we were seated inside, and when asked about the outdoor seating (the main attraction) we were told it would be an hour wait. This was disappointing as we made reservations for that very reason. The spicy gumbo we got was outstanding. The wings were average, and the pulled pork platter was very large, but again average. Pina colada was outstanding and served in a pineapple. Wait staff was great. Probably won't return as there are so many options in Tampa.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"The Union Public House is a new addition to the Tucson bar and restaurant scene. They opened Halloween Weekend, 2011 and since then have been getting better and better. When they purchased this location they completely overhauled the space and did it right. First walking into this place you really get a traditional pub feeling, wood floors and open space with a large bar area and an extra large outdoor patio. The ambiance is perfect but it is a bit loud.   The menu is fabulous I've tried everything from the Fish and Chips to the flat breads and I can honestly say I haven't been disappointed. Having lived in the UK, one of the first things I try at a new ""pub"" are the Fish and Chips. But their fish was well cooked and the batter was crispy and not soggy at all. The Union Public House is an authentic taste of what a real ""pub"" is all about. The beer selection is wide and the cocktail menu is incredibly creative.   I also have a soft spot for The Union Public House because they give back to their community and have been since they opened. They participated in St. Phillip's Plaza's ""A Winter Night's Dream"" and donated profits from a wine tasting to the Junior League of Tucson, a non-profit whose goal is empowering women to make their community a bettery place and whose local focus area is making homes safe for the independent elderly.

"Me and my husband each had a two piece combo meal, it had very little meat and what there was of that was very dry. The mashed potatoes were so imitation tasting and the macaroni and cheese was disgusting. I Paid $16.01, could've went to a restaurant and had a better meal.

"Went in tonight for the first time in quite a while. We were well satisfied. First off, the bread they bring is amazing. A touch of herbs and garlic with the same herby garlicky butter to go with it. We all agreed we could eat the bread and salad and be happy. I had the meat lovers calzone. It's huge. I'll have it for lunch tomorrow too. Also had the house salad with the house creamy garlic dressing. I'd eat the dressing on the bread. It's good and I love garlic. Kid 1 had kids spaghetti and fries. Fries appeared to be fresh cut and they were hot. I liked them too. She ate most of it. Kid 2 had kids chicken and fries. Again no complaints. Always a winner with no complaints. Wife had chicken parm and angel hair special. It too was huge. I'll have it for lunch this week too. I'd say they could probably lower their prices just a little and cut their portions in half and be just fine. Everything is a big portion. Server was prompt and attentive, beer was ice cold and the piano player in the bar is awesome. Really adds a little class. All in all 4 stars for food and service. The only thing I noticed was the banquette we sat in was a little shaky and I think the location of the salad bar, right inside the door, is a little odd. It's a little dark too and could maybe use a little professional decorating advice. Lighten things up just a touch maybe. Other than that we'll go back. A good local business. I'd recommend you try it too.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0

"This review is for having dinner at the bar before a concert at the Keswick theater - without a reservation.   It's stupid to think you'd be seated at a small restaurant on a Friday night, 2 hours before a concert next door, but there were a few seats at the bar available and other people were already eating there.  The bar stools have backs on them which is a plus.  I saw 2 cozy rooms on each side of the entry/bar that were already full. The place has a nice atmosphere, I loved the decor.  It's a welcome addition to Keswick Avenue.  The 1 bartender kept up with a super busy room nicely.  The drinks were great, the food was very good.    Menu is limited so check it online before you go & portions are small.  We ordered crab dip which was well prepared and served hot, & a charcuterie sampler which was loaded with yummy bruschetta but light on the meat. The bar menu clearly stated that food was 1/2 off Wednesday-Friday between 5-7pm but we were charged full price during this time period.  I would advise the owners to not put tiny asterisks next to a few items on a BAR MENU but otherwise this is a lovely restaurant with great service.  Well done.

Now for the not so good: The pork chop was just plain overcooked and had no sauce to speak of The prices were very expensive for what you get There were only a handful of bourbon based cocktails on the drink menu The food menu online was not up to date with what they were serving, the lamb plate that I saw (and that people had recommended) was nowhere to be found.

"I love the patio and have only encountered a couple of friendly servers. The food is decent, would be better if they kept the menu the same. Manager Scott is very rude, on multiple occasions. I've gone back multiple times, even brought friends and family. But after this last visit I definitely will never go back. I use to tell My clients to go to Noble Hops, however that is going to change as well. Management seems to be very snobby and not a very welcoming environment.

I wasn't going to get the mayo or cheese on the vegan wrap, but the woman that worked here explained to me that both are vegan, and I am so glad that I decided to try the wrap with the vegan cheese and vegan mayo! It was excellent. The muffins here are also great.

"I've been here a handful of times. The ambiance is great- very colorful and energetic. Some of the servers look unprofessional and unkempt, however, particularly one server I had who wore a dirty, ill-fitting tank top. When you're serving food, you should appear to be pristine.... Anyway, my boyfriend and I went here 2 weeks ago. We were in the mood to taste a lot of different things, so we crafted our order to allow us as many different foods as possible. We started with the Roadhouse Fries with gorgonzola cheese. They were good, but underseasoned. We kept having to add salt and pepper. For dinner, he got the Mississippi Catfish (fried) platter, which came with two sides- he got the greens and the BBQ spaghetti. The greens were phenomenal. He's a black man from the south, so he knows his greens, and he was impressed. He commented that the BBQ spaghetti was more flavorful than the last time he had tried it. The catfish was fine, nothing special. I ordered the seafood platter, which came with 3 (tiny) portions of: Louisiana shrimp (4 tiny shrimp in a really good broth), crab cake (it was mediocre), and seafood pasta (noodles were overcooked, flavor was pretty bland, shrimp were miniscule). For $20, I was pretty disappointed in the quantity AND quality of this dish. It also came with two sides- I got the corn casserole (pretty tasty), and hush puppies (they were ok). For dessert, we got a slice of sweet potato pie. It was not good. Totally undersweetened and lacked any flavor. So by the end of the night, we tried 10 different items. In general, the food was good, but definitely not great. Our appetizer had us fairly full, so we did have enough leftovers to have a nice sized snack the next day, which is a bonus. If you go here, it does pay to get their reward card. We currently have $43 on ours, so next time we go in, we get 50% off our bill using those points. Every time you spend money, you earn money off your next bill. In general, this place is good, worth a try at the very least.",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 3.0

"Filthy disgusting cesspool. This hotel is, hands down, the filthiest place I've ever stayed. We got a handful of rooms for a convention. A few of the rooms were tolerable (nothing fancy, outdated interior, gross bathrooms, greasy looking stains all over all the doors and walls). Carpet is filthy... so much so I always kept socks on. 2 of the rooms were DISGUSTING. One smelled like a giant ashtray, had dust everywhere and the bathroom door didn't close. Asked for a new room and were immdiatly told they were booked but that they would do a ""smell treatment"" and that the room wasn't supposed to be a smoking room even though there was an ashtray on the end table. One of our other rooms smelled like dirty feet and urine. We were also told they would do a ""smell treatment"" on that room. When we returned, both rooms still smelled. We were able to get another room to replace the smokey dusty room even though they were ""all booked"".   Supposedly this place is in the beginning of renovations. There is caution tape everywhere, disgusting vents filled with mystery lint in the out door walkways, cigarette butts litering the property, the pool is taped off and being torn up, all of the breezeways and doors are FILTHY. The bathroom in my room is dirty (walls are brown, black specks...mold? on my bathroom ceiling) Also, there is dirt and dust and hair in the bathroom vent which is out in the open and easy for any competent housekeeper to see and clean. No joke, if I wasn't stuck here for work I would have ran the other way the moment I stepped on the property. The place is so gross I can't imagine how a simple renovation will do it justice. It has suffered from serious neglect for what appears to be a long long time.  Room Tip: The reviews are consistently poor for this place.

"My wife and I are afficianados of oriental buffets and I would have to rate this place above average (not perfect, though) from the others in the Nashville area.    The name only says Japanese Buffet, but in actuality, it is a standard Chinese buffet plus Japanese sushi buffet.  Let me explain with the pros and cons of this establishment: Pros: An excellent sushi bar with a great variety of sushi rolls and a much better than average Hibachi section including steak.  Also in their fruit section there was a very good selection of grapes, peaches and other fruits.  Also among the pros is the fact that they have two prices for the buffet - with or without crab legs - a definite plus for vegetarians who hate to pay a high price for something they aren't going to eat.  The cons: the chinese buffet section is the standard fare - nothing outstanding here and, for vegetarians, just the usual mushrooms, green beans, spring rolls, fried rice and lo mein noodles.  No vegetable delight or mai fun like many other chinese buffets.  This can be made up for though by using the Hibachi section where the selection of vegetarian options is exceptionally nice.  It could be even a touch better if they added a bean curd/tofu options for vegetarians.   The dessert area has the standard pre-made coconut cookies and oriental cake desserts that come pre-frozen seen in most oriental buffets in the Nashville area...nothing new here, along with the standard eight or so flavors of ice cream.    Bottom line - worth a try and definitely a place my wife and I will return to when we are in the Hermitage area.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"We actually did this back in August '10, but seeing as how I'm new here on Yelp, I'm going back to write a review on this becuase it's actually a great time!  Even if you're an experienced segway rider and it's no big deal to you, the guided tours are the best way to see Santa Barbara.  Very informative and a couple of different tours are available for different parts of the area.  If you've never been on a Segway before, they spend time with you to make sure you know what you're doing before they take you out, and it doesn't really take any time at all.  We had so much fun on this tour, we've since done segway tours in other areas.  My wife did one in San Diego Balboa Park that she said was almost as good, but so far nothing has topped this.  We're looking forward to going back sometime this year and taking in one of the other tours!

"I got married at Kings Mills 4 years ago. It was a welcome relief after talking to several snooty venue coordinators that were inflexible and expensive. I stumbled on Kings Mills website since they do not advertise. I kinda wished they did even it was just in the Daily Times.   Price: Very reasonable. After being told that $100 a plate was the cheapest other places would go. The catch is that they have a minimum guest amount so it guarantees that the make something like $10,000 at least per wedding. They were kind enough to lower the minimum for me.   Venue Space: Gorgeous! I loved the classic colonial charm. The waterfall (that was used for the mill back in the day) is breathtaking. This was the reason that I was sold. They also have several rooms available. Stone walls and all hardwood. If you are looking for a modern updated space don't go because you wont appreciate the history in the walls here. I felt no need to over-decorate the space so it saved me money in decorations. I even loved the smell: stone, wood and water. It was refreshing.  Convenience: Plenty of space for parking and very accessible from Philly or Delaware. Although there is a clear sign,  you can drive by it pretty easily if you have a lead foot.    Customer Service: Honestly I was taken aback by how friendly they were.  I think they were taken aback by me since I was a very non-traditional bride. No ring bearer, flower girl, attendants, ushers, jumping the broom, father giving you away. You mean you're walking down that long lonely aisle by yourself!! *gasp* Some people may find it condescending but I just rolled with it. I rather that than someone looking at me like I'm wasting their time because I'm on a budget. Calls were returned, questions were answered and they were flexible. Things were spelled out clearly no surprises.   Food: Delicious!! My guests are still raving about the food! If the food is bad then things have drastically changed. My guests were so full at cocktail hour they thought it was dinner. They don't do tastings though which made me nervous. I only had word from a friend of the family that they had good food.   Day of Wedding : It rained the day of and I was delirious and thought it would stop just for me. (That April showers May flowers is a lie!) The owner met me at the door when I arrived and said ""So we still going to have the wedding outside?!"" *Smile* I replied ""Yes we are!""  *Crazy smile with sparkling eye* Don't ask me that I'm getting married today which automatically makes me crazy. An example of the friendliness may sound condescending. Needless to say wedding was inside in their chapel.   I was hidden in a room in the back of the chapel. Panic Room I think they called it but may have been joking. I was given water, able to take pictures. Ceremony no problems. Picture time no problems. Moving from the chapel to the reception small issue. Since it was raining I would have liked a hallway to just walk through so I never had to go outside. But I was left alone with no staff after picture time in the chapel. I think this is the time when someone with larger pockets has the limo take them to the other side of the property.   Cocktail hour started right on time for my guests but I was left waiting in the vestibule smelling the food, hearing everyone rave about how good it was, my own wedding party talking with food in their mouths.....hungry. Everyone assumed I had my own server. The servers were a lil slow about getting to me. I waiting patiently but after some time (who knows how long. brides can't tell time). Then I stole a piece of food from  the best man's hand and crashed the cocktail hour. (So much for that elegant entrance). So if you want someone to be with you every second hire a wedding coordinator or get a family member or friend to attend to you.   The owner does do a cheesy speech of two becoming one and does a lil Kings Mills infomercial in the middle of the reception. He presents you with a plague holding a $2 bill in a frame. I was so delirious from love, excitement and having food for the first time in a week, i hardly noticed. This may be annoying for some but we just hung the lil plague up in our dining room.   We had a few of the additions: the picture where they do a Photoshop effect of you and hubby in the middle of the falls. That was a big hit at the  reception since they do it right there day of. People actually asked how we got in the falls without getting wet. Looking closer at the picture they cut off my husband's goatee. Nothing major but just make sure to check thoroughly.   We had a chocolate fountain also. Big hit everyone left happy, full and with leftovers.  If I did it again I would choose Kings Mills again. I wished they had smaller rooms there so we could do other events their like anniversaries, baby showers etc.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 4.0

"Our daughter has unfortunately had to spend a lot of time at the dentist- but Dr. Blair and his team have made that time as painless as possible! Everyone from the lady at check in, to the dental tech, to Dr. Blair himself are welcoming, professional, and caring. We always have a good experience at the office, but there are 2 times that really stand out.  1) Our daughter had a space retainer for a molar come loose and start cutting up her gums. I called and left a message, as they were closed that day. I was called back promptly, and given instructions until we could get into the office for an emergency appointment. 2) We were camping and had a horrible accident- our kiddo had gotten a concussion, and knocked out a molar completely. This was on a Sunday, and we left the ER without anyone addressing her knocked out tooth. I called and left a message with details on the after hours voicemail. Dr. Blair HIMSELF CALLED ME BACK WITHIN MINUTES! He told us to come in right now, and he would take a look. She had evidently also concussed her two front ADULT teeth, and he was able to give us care instructions to make sure they didn't get damaged further! I didn't even know you could concuss teeth! Dr. Blair came in ON A SUNDAY NIGHT, and did x-rays himself just to make sure our kiddo was taken care of! He also gave her a stuffed puppy that she still has today, he was able to make her smile, and feel better for just a little bit while in a ton of pain. We can't thank Dr. Blair enough.

The hotel seems to be new, the entire lobby is very welcoming, magazines and the daily paper (local, wall street journal, NY times, Sunday paper, etc) with several computers for free usage and printer capacity.  The lobby opens up to the dinning area which includes breakfast from 6-10am, Starbucks coffee and although I didn't try dinner, I did take a glance at the menu and was pleasantly surprised- from your regular deli-style sandwich to a quesadilla or a personal style pizza. They also serve alcohol (wine and beer)!  The staff are very friendly and helpful. You're always greeted with a smile when you enter.   Overall the rooms are what you would expect at any hotel.

"A solid 3 stars.  After an afternoon of boarding and being out in the cold, a large bowl of pho always hits the spot.  I've been here a couple of times and I wasn't disappointed.  I'm not expecting anything spectacular from any pho restaurants around here.  I just want a bowl of soup that satisfies the basics of pho.  This restaurant does just that.  The spring rolls are larger than usual and the ingredients aren't as fresh compared to other ones I've had.  Also, the wrapper is thicker than usual which made it a bit chewier.  The pho is pretty good.  The meat isn't super tender and is on the fatty side but it's fine with me.  The noodles are decent and the broth is fairly tasty.  Add sriracha, oyster sauce, and some jalapenos and it'll kick the broth to life adding lots more flavor.    2 large bowls of pho + spring rolls + iced coffee = ~ $20.  Not bad at all for a meal that makes you full.  With all that money you saved by eating here, you can now gamble the rest of it away at the tables.

"I'm really impressed with Hilltown Tavern.  How have I not been here before?  From the outside you may think this is your typical neighborhood pub, but the food is definitely above average.  Dishes I tried: -Nachos with chicken: These were excellent.  Nachos usually are not my first choice for an appetizer, but these looked so delicious when the waitress placed them on the table that I just couldn't resist.  First of all, whatever type of cheese they use is superior to the standard nacho cheddar.  It was super tasty and melted into a sort of sauce rather than becoming stringy.  Second, the chicken was of the pulled variety so it was more evenly dispersed than chunks of chicken would have been.  The third thing I really liked about these nachos was that they were loaded with fresh toppings.  Guac, pico, and pickled jalapeños all come standard which definitely elevated these above your typical pub fare. -Bread Pudding: This is the best bread pudding I've ever tried!  Again, this is not my usual choice of dessert (I hate soggy bread) but the texture on this was amazing.  Fluffy and rich at the same time.  The bread is torn into pieces, layered into a loaf pan with the batter, and then cut into new slices (at least from what I can tell).  Each piece is caramelized on the bottom which adds a fabulous light crunch.  This dessert is served with caramel and a chocolate drizzle.  Although I liked both sauces, I thought the chocolate was unnecessary and would like to try it with just the caramel next time.  The plate could easily serve two, and possibly even four if you're stuffed from dinner and everyone just wants a bite of dessert.  However, I'd stick to sharing with one other person since you'll want to keep eating it. :) OH - and this dessert is five dollars.  Get it.  Drinks I tried: -Raspberry Mojito: This was very refreshing, albeit sweet.  I recommend mixing it up when you get it otherwise the bottom of the drink will taste sweeter than the top.  The mint was well-muddled and added a nice freshness to this drink. -Sangria: The available sangria flavor changes, so ask your server what is currently being offered.  When I was here, it was a sweet white with citrus.  Good, but nothing life-changing. -Guinness Martini (not sure if this was the exact name): Dessert cocktail with Bailey's and chocolate.  Good flavor, stronger than anticipated.  Would probably stick to one of these towards the end of the meal.  Next time I'm dining out in the area, this will be my first choice.  I'm looking forward to trying other dishes on the menu, and to dining outdoors when the weather warms up.  I also can't wait to eat that bread pudding again!",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0

I don't hate it.  I like it.  I went last night with my boyfriend and my parents and we all left without any complaints.  With my mother (who I love very much), this is a tough feat...   We started with a few drinks -- the espresso martini was really good, not too sweet with lots of coffee flavor.  I thought the Key Lime Martini was also good, yet it lacked a graham cracker rim, which was sad.  We got the crab and spinach fondue, though not really a fondue and more of a dip, and it was quite tasty.  The cheese steak spring rolls were even commended by my boyfriend, and he's quite the connoisseur.  As for entrees, they were all presented nicely, though some with a bit too much sauce.

"Such a cool 'man stuff' place! I put quotations because there is such neat stuff here even as a gal it's worth checking out. They have great ideas for nifty gifts!  From axes, knives, ties, shaving gear, to a champagne bottle cutter. You'll find an array of adventurous items!  If walking along Whyte Ave it's more on the west end, there may be some street parking nearby but we've found we end up checking this place out more in the summertime on walks down Whyte Ave.  But seriously stop and see the champagne bottle cutting sword- so fascinating it made me want to buy a bottle of champagne to test out!  Our father also adores this store and was a great little stop for Father's Day for him to pick up some sharpening stones for his little knife and axe collection.

"Why 5 stars?  Because Shephard's was the home to the most fun 3 weekends of my life.     ---   ---   ---  The summer of 2010 was good to me.  My friends and I crashed the holiday parties at Shephard's on the Memorial Day, 4th of July and Labor Day weekends.  The place was an absolute mad house.  I cannot recommend the following enough: If you want to partake in these festivities, reserve a hotel room far in advance.  The cheaper rooms fill up quickly, and it's in everyone's best interest that no one is driving home after a long day at Shep's.  Not only that, but you don't want to miss out on being able to party late into the night.  I don't know what more you could ask for from Shephard's.  It's located on the most beautiful beach I've ever been to.  It's the only place in Clearwater Beach that you can posses an open container.  When beer was invented, it was intended to be consumed on the beach, walking distance from your bed of the evening.  Good thing I was able to keep the beach body in tact by pounding only Mich Ultra's during these events.  Drinking Mich Ultra is like drinking a protein shake and going for a jog, right?  The food is great - the chicken tender basket is by far that best you will ever eat.  I'm not sure how the inside buffet is for a family dinner on the beach, but for replenishment of food after hours of beer in the sun, it's the best thing ever.  Most people call Disney World the happiest place on Earth, I give that title to Shephard's.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 5.0

Inside the restaurant bar area they have a couple Tv's and the rest of the restaurant is set up pretty nicely! I love the ambience here.   Now onto the import stuff, the food! The chips and salsa was just Ok. I found the tortilla chips to be too thick. Mexican food is one of my favorite, so I am very picky.

"This family-owned and operated restaurant is in an unassuming strip mall between town and country and Oldsmar. Definitely not the spot you would expect to find such great food. You know when you find that awesome down-home breakfast spot? The one that gives you fresh to order eggs, fresh off the pig bacon, and not-from-the-box pancakes that you just crave?? Yea, this is like that... but for Thai food. Every single thing is handmade, so you wait... and it. is. worth it.  The vegetable curry puff-things (under the vegetarian section) were like mini curry filled empanadas from heaven.  Of the four of us, there wasn't one thing we ordered that wasn't fantastic. The goung tad is simply deep fried shrimp and vegies which would probably be better as an app but was great regardless. The Pla Dook Pad Ped (fried catfish dish) was very good. The squid salad is prepared differently than you are used to if you are used to Japanese style so don't order it if you are expecting it to come out like it.   **Insider Alert: Now... if you are very special, you can ask for the Crispy Duck. It's not on the menu, but they will make it for you special and it is real good :)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"The pizza is really good, but the customer service is the reason why I won't order from here anymore.. The first experience that made me not want to order again was a Friday night so obviously super busy for delivery which I understand the girl on the phone said 2 hours so after 2 1/2 hours I called to check on my delivery thinking it'd be soon, just to have the girl tell me it would be 2-3 more hours when I asked to speak to the manager to see what happened he told me the same thing and I told him when I had ordered they said 2 hours it's been 2 1/2 how was that possible he really had nothing to say so I just cancelled my order.. A few months later decided to try it again got pizza and wings with buffalo sauce, picked up this time looked at the wings and it looked and smelt like bbq sauce so I told the girl at the front that I order buffalo she says yeah that's what it is, I despise bbq so I had my brother try it in the car, it's for sure bbq, asked her to fix it too buffalo since that's what I ordered she takes it to the back for a few seconds throws more bbq on it and gives it back to me. I look at it and tell her no i wanted buffalo sauce not bbq so she takes it to the back again and they just threw some buffalo on top of the bbq..

I got the crusted brie, which was probably the best brie I've ever had. Fries were soggy, but accompanied by a nice juicy burger.

"Hands down the worst place I have ever purchased furniture during the past 10 years I have opened up restaurants/bars/lounges. I have been purchasing furniture from liquidators in Florida for several years. I have NEVER come across a company so unprofessional as this one. Owner has a poor attitude,  Business is run worse than a garage sale, they are not set up to be in business. I purchased 10 couches for a new business I am opening up in California. Was in the area so figured I add the furniture to a container I'm shipping. Owner has absolutely zero awareness to state tax laws. I have a resale certificate and proof of shipping that shows the product will be leaving the state and exported and she still tried to charge me SalesTax. These people are not in the business of liquidation and moving high-volume. When it came time to pick it up I asked for the furniture to be palletized. Their response is they don't have any pallets. . How are you a liquidator and do not have any pallets on site. What happens to customers who buy 30 or 40 pieces of something? It gets better.

"A friend that know I like to eat at a variety of places asked if I'd had Mission Taco yet, knowing also that I had been to a number of taco joints around St. Louis.  When they learned that I had not, I was told that I had to try it, the tacos were the best in St. Louis.  So I made it a point to get some on Friday for lunch.  And I must say that I was very pleased.  These probably were the best street-style tacos that I have had in St. Louis.  And the queso was quite good, too.  I had two BBQ duck tacos, two shrimp tacos, and a starter of queso con chorizo.  The BBQ duck tacos had a complex flavor that drew me in.  There was a very slight spiciness, with the duck, glaze, carnitas, etc. all flowing together.  You could taste the items individually, but then as you chewed, they came together in a sum that was greater than the whole.  The duck itself was tender, without greasiness having been slow roasted.  Pork belly carnitas provided some variety and contrast, both in the meat flavor and in more chewiness.  An ancho-agave glaze, pickled onions, and crisp jalapeno strips then made it complex and interesting.  Good job.  The shrimp tacos were similarly top notch.  Despite being battered and fried, the shrimp were not rubbery and still bit through easily.  These tacos had a mild flavor, with some sweetness provided by the mango salsa and mango-hop-anero aioli.  Those toppings went well with the cabbage slaw and smashed avocado to again provide an interesting and multi-ingredient direction for a full flavor.  The queso con chorizo topped typical quesos for me because it had fresh-made chorizo sausage bits in it, of course.

"We came here pretty late at night and it was busy. They told us that a party of 6 would have to wait 40 minutes so we decided to walk towards bourbon street and enjoy some hand grenades. Exactly ten minutes later they called my friend and told them that our table was ready. Although I was glad that the wait was shorter it annoyed the crap out of me because they were off by a good 30 minutes. After we arrived to the restaurant, we still had to wait several minutes to be seated. Our waitress was nice but she messed up our friends order. Maybe I was really tired but overall I didn't enjoy the service at this restaurant.   The food was alright. The only thing I enjoyed were the charbroiled oysters. I actually have a strong dislike for oysters so I was really impressed with these. They were yummy. The Lobster Marco was alright. I felt like there was nothing special about it. It tasted very generic like you could get it from any major chain restaurant. When it comes to food I wasn't impressed.

"I did not have any services i just got the day pass to use all the ammenities. Locals receive 15% off Monday through Thursday making it $38 for the day. We started out by using the gym. Its small yet appears to be very nice equipment, until you try to use it. All the cardio equipment has a touch screen and most of them malfunctioned in one way or another. Overall i found the fitness area to be very mediocre. We then moved onto the locker rooms to change so we were able to use the 'lounges' the spa offers. One is like a sauna but cooler (about 100 degrees), one has 2 jacuzzis and an ice pool and the last room was some sort of light and respiratory therapy by the use of some sort of salt fountain. With the exception of the jacuzzi lounge with the spectacular views, i found the other lounges to be very gimmicky. The locker rooms have a very nice herbal steam room and a cedar plank sauna that i found to be excellent. The tea lounge that offers refreshments was nice including complimentary tea, water, fruit and snacks. Considering you can hang out here from 8am-8pm for $38 makes it an extremely reasonable way to un-wind.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 4.0
"We like the brunch here but the service this last time was lacking. Some tips for Jesse: when customers walk in to your establishment you should excuse yourself from your conversation and greet them, smile and acknowledge that you will be right with them. Bring over menus and let them know you're available to answer any questions.  If they are having coffee,  make sure you have coffee brewed. If you do have to brew fresh coffee, keep customers updated on the status so they know you haven't forgotten about them. When they're done eating, clear dirty dishes.  Offer refills on coffee before you go to the coffee bar next door to get coffee for your friends. Ask customers if they would like to order anything else before you bring them their check. Upsell and smile. Its not rocket.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I wanted to kayak the caves of Channel Islands, but I didn't like how other companies required you to organize your own transportation to the island first and then meet up with the kayaking company.  Wild Blue is an all-in-one package! You meet them at the port in Oxnard, and you're in their hands from 8AM to 4PM.  The experience itself was amazing! I signed up for cave tours and I got cave tours! We kayaked all the way from the east end of Anacapa Island to the west end, exploring at a minimum 5 caves (with the option of more if you're daring enough).  And the caves all were special in their own way. Spoiler alert if you want to be surprised, but some of the caves had a lobster bed, a turquoise pool, or a tiny tunnel of light guiding you through!  My guide Mark was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. I felt safe the entire time, and never once did I feel like I was about to fall off my kayak. Plus the entire crew was hilarious, cracking jokes every minute!  They've also modified their procedures for COVID as well. There was plenty of room on their boat to maintain social distancing, and everyone's temperature was checked and masks were enforced (except for during lunchtime and when you're on your kayak).

My husband and I held our rehearsal dinner here this past October, and I have to say it was as enjoyable as our wedding day!   Off the bat, Mansion Inn's staff was responsive and patient with me during the planning process. They provided information and availability quickly, and were willing to customize the menu and bar options to suit our group. We were able to hold a cocktail hour in their bar area, followed by a private dinner in their larger dining room. The ambiance, food and service were exceptional.   I was also pleasantly surprised that the owners Kris and Joe were on site the entire time, not just overseeing, but working the bar and kitchen. There were even some last minute requests that we hadn't previously discussed, and they accommodated with grace.

"This place is not for the faint of hearts. Ya you the one that complains about spots on the silverware. That's from the dishwasher. =p If that's you don't come here please coz you'll give them a bad review because of it and they're good.  It's a total dive spot. I've seen people walk in and turn around and walk out. The parking lot is tiny but i think they're expanding it into the next plaza. You walk up to the building and you're like do I walk up the ramp or up the stairs? Which door do I open?  When you open the door you're a bit confused. Make sure that someone sees you so they know you're there. The customers after us just walked in and kind of sat there for a while... I had to motion over to the lady that there was someone else inside.  Our waitress is the sweetest old lady. You feel kind of weird having her take your order, or at least i did because it was like my grandma was asking me what to eat drink etc.where as i'm used to asking her what she needs. I wanted to tell her to sit down and rest! hahah Anyways, it's broken English so a bit of translation will get lost along the way. She kind of forgot about us after she brought the drink and felt horrible when she realized 10 minutes into it that she never got our order. Just stay for the entire ride it's well worth it. The food was done quickly after that. =) Get the Vietnamese coffee, it's that jolt of energy that will last well into the night. The food is very fresh. We got fresh rolls and they were packed so tightly nothing fell out and into my sauce, this is a plus! They weren't stingy like other places are with just putting 2 pieces of shrimp and a slice of beef. They loaded it up with 3 shrimp and slices of beef mmm. The hubs and I shared the pork chop plate and it was just the right size to be content but not completely filled. They have the sauce on the side that needs to be in the rice! Its a mix of sour and sweet.  The name always made me laugh and finally we turned into the lot and tried it. I'm glad we did!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

When I called to ask for it the next day, I was put on hold for 10 minutes, had to call back, and then was told they didn't have it. I asked when the bartender from the night before would be working again (so I could check with him/her directly), and I was given a nasty attitude and told by this member of the staff that they couldn't possibly know when people work there!

"Their Sonoran Hot Dogs with everything (mayo, mustard, beans, green sauce(tomatillo?), onions, tomato and the roasted yellow pepper) are my favorite. Tried some others around town, they don't compare (even that super crowded place across the street...). The secret here is the Tacos de Cabeza, flavor & texture is amazing. No matter what else I order I always get a couple of these. Caramellos are good too, carne asada and melted cheese sandwiched between two tiny flour tortillas. Even though the menu is not huge, I always have a difficult time deciding what to order.  To compliment the meal, there is an excellent salsa bar. Beware, if you can't handle the Scoville's, most salsas are medium to hot even the pico. It's so good I usually ignore it and pay later. There are at least 3 or 4 salsas, pico de gallo, a guacamole concoction (with what looks like cottage cheese in it), radish, pickled red onions, lime wedges, cukes.   Dining area is small, stainless steel tables and benches. Never had a problem getting a seat. It's outside, expect the usual pests, the place is kept clean, but who or what can resist the aromas. There are heaters for the winter, misters? for summer, don't remember, usually only go there when it's nice outside. Parking lot is huge, watch out for the pot holes.   They do have another location on 1st North of Grant which is indoors, have yet to make a visit.

The vibe of this dinner is really relaxed - feels like one of those tv diners where there are friendly women who serve up coffee to cold case cops. There is a tv playing the news in the side room so as you wait for your food you can catch up on the days happenings.  I'm a vegetarian and this place has a ton of options including a veggie panini and veggie burger. I ordered the veggie panini with fries...it also comes with coleslaw but I didn't eat any. Overall, this was really satisfying. The panini was great and it had a really good pesto sauce on it. Fries were very tasty as well but nothing special.

Be forewarned, though, that if you're not a local resident and you want to cancel your membership they will make you jump through hoops. I purchased a month-to-month membership while visiting family in Indy during the holidays and forgot to physically cancel in person. I was surprised to learn that Mei Fitness won't accept a phone call or e-mail to cancel memberships. Instead, they make you write a letter that you have to physically mail. In the age of e-mail and smartphones this is an extremely antiquated practice.

"I was desperate for a new color and new cut. My regular salon was closed, so I drove up 19, and saw this one on the sign. YES,  I quite literally picked this salon at random. I didn't read reviews and I didn't find out about the before hand. They simply were the first salon I came to.  I walked in, gave my name and told the gentleman (John) what I wanted. I spoke with the other stylist (Diana) and she said she'd take me as soon as she finished with her current clients. She was styling one, and letting the other finish his dye.  It wasn't much more than a half hour wait before I was welcomed to her chair.     She sat me down for a small consult, and I explained i wanted to change my color. I home dye but I always end up with my roots being one color, and the shaft/ends being a whole different shade.  She got her books and showed me a few different shades, we selected Rocket Red.  It looked great in the book; vibrant and warm.  The dying process was easy, Diana was lovely to talk to. We had similar styles in hair already, both of us having long, baby fine hair. She was previously a red head, so it was interesting to see someone with the same name with the same style.   Letting the dye sit, I leafed through magazines, taking note of the salon, it was very neat and up kept. Very modern. I learned that their staff often participates in hair shows.   When my hair was rinsed, we did the cut and though I asked for it to be shorter, slightly layered, my cut isn't dramatically different than it was before, but I'm not upset.  The color didn't turn out like it was in the book, but it is this LUSH rich auburn color that is stunning and will look fantastic for New Years.   The service aspect of the salon was top notch. Diana really went above and beyond while she worked on me. John, too seemed to truly care for his client.  Will I return? Yes, Yes I will.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 4.0

"I applaud any restaurant that boasts a table side display of Caesar Salad action.  Leaving out places like California Pizza Kitchen, and Buca di Beppo, I do enjoy seeing the food prepared for me to a certain degree.  With an authentically made Caesar salad, it takes knowledge, appreciation, and certainly some training to whip that bowl of ingredients into action.  All the food we had was simply made, and good.  Not over the top delicioso, and nothing to write home about, but satisfying for a hungry tummy.  There are finer Italian meals to be enjoyed in the city a few blocks south of here.  The draw for me that almost bumped me up a star is the decor and the feel.  There was a fine piano player kickin it jazz and standards style the night I ate here, and that made for a romantic backdrop to the meal.

"I'd never been here until a few weeks back when my partner suggested it. I had the steak tips and twice baked potato with a gin cocktail; he got the fish and chips with a snake bite. My drink was absolutely wonderful and the food was pretty good. Only complaint that time was that a side of eight green beans cost $4 and that medium rare was more like medium well. That's cool...it's not fine dining and I knew that.   I liked it enough that I chose to go back -- I picked it over Sonic, which is my all-time favorite fast food joint. Again, tonight as before, the service was on point. We were greeted immediately and seated at a couch by the fire. Our server was friendly and prompt. When it appeared as though we hadn't yet been helped, a manager even swung by to check in on us and we assured him that we had just ordered and we're waiting on drinks.   The food tonight though was just awful. Terrible.   The portion of steak tips I got tonight was about half what I received last time. The gravy was less creamy, with some overly sweet element to it, as though it hadn't had enough time to cook. Again, medium rare was more like medium well. But the worst part is it arrived with about 20 sad fries on the plate and no baked potato in sight. Our server got one out for me by the time I'd finished my steak tips, but I was admittedly annoyed that the chef and the food runner alike didn't appear to know their menu.   On the other side of the table things were even worse. My partner ordered the bacon mac-and-cheese. He refused to let me say anything about it, but it was easily the most unimpressive dish I've ever seen come out of a kitchen. I don't know how you can make something whose primary ingredients are noodles, cheese, and bacon taste bland, but they pulled it off. It was essentially buttered macaroni noodles drowned inexplicably in crushed red pepper and cayenne, sprinkled with bacon dust and broiled. The only things I've ever sent back to a kitchen have been steaks at fancy joints when they weren't cooked enough. Tonight, if my partner had let me, I would have sent back a dish for essentially the first time ever.   I like the fire pits and the feel of this place. Maybe we'll try it for a burger sometime and hope for better results, but given how utterly disappointing tonight's experience was, I have a feeling we'll end up over at Sonic next time we're in the area.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Before I go any further, let me elaborate on my grading system ... this is, at its finest, a three star hotel so that is my starting place ...  I must deduct a star for service.  While the staff is friendly, it is not thoughtful ... we are diamond members and I expect to be welcomed as such.  There was no acknowledgement at all that we have stayed in 27 hyatts so far this year with plans for five more (yes I am counting) and I have no idea how many nights.  After we checked in, no one directed us to our room and we wandered around between buildings with our luggage until we found our room.  The amenities were fine with only a few minor flaws ... there is no lotion provided in the room.  I bring my own so this is not a big deal.  The bigger deal is there is NO HOT WATER.  This affected our stay as I maintained a slight chill for our entire visit ... horrible enough for me to take away the ""amenity/facility star"" but that would leave just one left and honestly, the place was better than that.  The water in our room, #1213, was warm but not hot which I realize is a savings for the hotel but is jut acceptable to this guest.  We were pleased with the breakfast and there is a rather nice outdoor pool that would be lovely during appropriate times if the year.  The room was fresh and well laid out with a full size kitchen.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 2.0

Every time I have been to this location the security guard I'll just make her K. likes to harass my family. Even went to the point of telling the cashier not to sale certain items to my sister. Today they went in and again K. Tells my 12 year old nephew not to touch things mind you they are shopping for food and he is helping. I've complained to the store a few things and she continues. now to my knowledge a security guard is not to be putting food away that's not her job she is not to be telling people not to touch things not her job and she should not be telling the cashier's what to sell and what not to sell this makes their business go down. her job is to be posted at the door checking and making sure nobody is stealing anything. I have been to many different Fry's and by far this has been the worst experience I've ever had at this location if it continues I will be finding a new store. I will be making a complaint to her boss as well.,Business Category: Grocery,Review Stars: 1.0

"I was taking my 90 year old cousin out for the day. Decided to go to Chestnut Hill Grill for lunch.  I have been here before and the food is always good. I called to see if they take reservations and was told only for parties of 5 or more. I explained that my cousin was 90 years old and didn't want her standing around to long waiting for a seat. They let me talk to the manager and they were very nice and accommodating.  They also suggested we sit upstairs so she wouldn't have to climb the stairs.  Also the bathroom is on the first floor (none downstairs).  When we arrived,  our table was waiting :) I did not realize that on the weekends they only have a brunch menu until two pm. This was my only issue.  The menu is set for certain times. That's  it!  You can't get any options off the lunch or dinner menu at that time. The waitress was pleasant and patient with us. Giving us time to decide what to order. She was helpful with answering all our questions. My cousin decided on the Classic Egg Breakfast with sausage.  She could not understand that a potato pancake was potatoes and that she didn't need syrup! She said everything was delicious.   I got the Brunch Burger with fries. The beef was fresh and juicy.  The egg on top was just right. The fries,  just the right amount of crispy.  My food was also very good! It turned out to be a very pleasant day with my favorite cousin :) P.S. They have a parking lot that is for all the stores and restaurants in the area,  but it is very busy and hard to find a space on the weekends.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 5.0
"I have to drive past El Maguey to get to Señor Pique, and it's not worth the extra drove. My husband and I used to go occasionally when they were in their old location close to 141. They had really unique and more traditional Mexican dishes that were really outstanding. Now they have condensed their menu to the basic American Mexican that everyone else serves, and they don't do it better. Today I had the shrimp tacos. They started wrong by using tiny salad shrimp instead of regular, full size shrimp, so the texture was wrong. The sauce was very creamy and heavy, and there was no lettuce or cabbage to provide much needed crunch. They were a bummer. My husband's chicken enchiladas verde were ok but nothing to write home about. El Maguey makes them better. Kids meal macaroni and cheese was good. Cheese sauce was almost 6 dollars.    From now on, my family will stop at El Maguey or head into Kirkwood to Amigos for Mexican.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

I arrived, 2 managers, including Richard, had no idea what I was talking about and I left the store empty handed after travelling 120 miles round trip. I never heard from them again. Period. Now I read their CEO is collecting artifacts that do not belong to him. Hey kids, thats called stealing and according to some religious beliefs, thats a sin. They owe me the gas I spent in vain.

"Don't mistake this place for just another one of those teeny BYOBs in Rittenhouse Square - this spot is a gem!   Cozy atmosphere is complemented by truly well-executed dishes. Though the appetizer was a bit small for three people to share (we literally each had two pieces of duck and two pieces of pasta), it was the most delicious amuse-bouche I've had in a long time. The salmon with latkes and salmon skin salad was perfectly done and a nice-sized portion at that. The chicken was also really tasty and juicy, which I've found is weirdly hard to find at most places.  Though we didn't do dessert, the tables to our right and left both had the hazelnut crepe with ice cream and it looked divine! Judging by our neighbors' mmm's and the fact that their plates were practically licked clean in two minutes flat, I can't imagine they didn't love it.  To top everything off, since it's BYOB, the check was shocking (in a good way).   The only thing I feel I should warn about is that it's really tough to get a reservation, but well worth the wait.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Holy smokes. Monarch blew our minds - partly because we dropped in at 9:30 on a Wednesday night on our way up the coast (no expectations), but mostly because the flavor combinations were unexpected and meticulously crafted. Surprise, surprise - our impromptu road trip dinner turned out to be a Michelin-worthy artistic experience! Imaginative, delectable, layers of flavor, unique, pure magic. The kind of food you don't want to destroy with a utensil, but when you do, you just have to close your eyes and let the sensations wash over you. It's that good.  The following night (Thursday) beckoned to us with the promise of dinner at the Post Ranch Inn (the renowned Sierra Mar restaurant) where we planned to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday. Well no offense to Post Ranch, but Monarch outshined it in terms of culinary art. (Post Ranch was spectacular for the views, architecture, and experience - and the food was also very good - but at twice the price and half the flavor, held no candle to Monarch.)  If Monarch were in our area of Los Angeles, it would cost double the price and be booked out months in advance. In response to those reviewers complaining about price point, portions, and ""fanciness,"" please don't review all restaurants using a fixed scale. Would you complain about a Beethoven symphony because you wanted Spice Girls instead?  Monarch = Beethoven.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I've been a customer of the winery for a few years, but recently used them for a memorial party for about 30 people.   I've never hosted anything like that and was stressing.   The owners and staff of Stone Barn were so very tolerant of my nervous-nelly emails and questions, and they were so very helpful the night of the event.   Their wines are fabulous and stand alone, but the gentle support and friendliness of the staff was wonderful. I really felt like I was hanging out with some new friends.     I've been to many wineries in PA and there are many that are larger but feel like retail shopping.   Stone Barn isn't large, but is warm and cozy inside and out.  The perfect size for events of about 30 people.  My only constructive comment is that it is easy to drive by the winery if you haven't been there before.  I did have a lot of guests who were lost or passed by it a few times. Perhaps a larger sign or flag (or a 6 foot wine bottle) along Rt 100 would help!    This is my favorite winery for oh-so-many-reasons.  Their wines are really great and I received many positive comments from wine-loving-guests.

"So I'm Viet and moved here from Los Angeles so my standards might be a bit high.    We came on a weekend and although restaurant is small had no trouble getting a seat right away.  Ambiance: clean, small bathroom. Service: fast and understood more English than I expected for a mom/pop place  Food - Bun Bo Hue:  This is the south viet's answer to pho.  It's suppose to be a heavenly mix of different cuts of beef and pork.  The broth is suppose to be deep brown and with tangy/spicy lemongrass flavor.   Here portion size is large and the dish is decent/acceptable however it tastes more like a bastardized Pho version.  The broth is not that deep.  It's spicy but devoid of lemongrass tang.

We drove over to the address listed (the Virginia Ave address) and was told that Nameless had moved to 306 Prospect but the guy hadn't been there and wasn't really sure where they were. EXTREMELY difficult to find. We had to call twice, including once we finally found the building. No signs -- you had to enter through another bar/lounge. My husband was told to go into the kitchen. By the time we got our pizza and got home it was nearly 8, so we had to reheat everything. And we live downtown and are quite familiar Fountain Square and the surrounding area. They REALLY need to update their contact information.  Pizza had a thinner crust than I prefer. It came with ""skinny sticks."" I expected long, thing breadsticks, but they were thick and doughy.

It is a lovely little place that  with a friendly upscale ambiance that feels comfortable and elegant. The current owners have done a nice job with the remodeling of the small space.   We seated and drinks and a basket of warm house made flatbread (aka Pita) with hummus was brought while we reviewed the menu. The flatbread alone is worth the visit. Warm and flaky and tasty with a hint of rosemary baked in.   We started off with shrimp cigars. Lovely little tubes of puff pastry filled with creamy, spicy shrimp and an Asian style sweet dipping sauce. Great fusion of flavors.   I had the Moroccan Fish special - small rollups of sole with a light lemon sauce served with vegetables and grains. The Talbot Chardonnay was a great accompaniment to the slightly spicy tangy fish.

"I still come to Union 50 a lot. Their food is still terrific (specifically the fries and Smoked Pork Chop, but I've sampled about half of their menu at this point and haven't been disappointed yet). A star does need to be deducted from their restaurant though.   Every time I've been in the past few months the service has been less than great. Each time the waiter has either been spread too thin, they just haven't been particularly friendly, or a combination of the two. My biggest issue with Union 50 though is the noise level. I feel like a geriatric saying this, but it's just too loud. You literally have to yell to have a conversation to be heard over all of the other noise. If you want to carry a conversation on at a normal volume you have to show up for dinner before 5:00 (which only perpetuates the feeling that I've aged 40 or 50 years prematurely). There's really not much that can be done about the noise level other than showing up before the crowd arrives to start getting drunk.  Their patio, which I imagine is useable now that it's warmed up a bit, will be a nice escape from the noisy main dining area.",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 4.0

"Food was not even close to ""Thai hot,"" and when we asked for more spice, they gave us a pinch of spice because they were running out of peppers. I think you have a bigger problem if you are a Thai restaurant running out of Thai peppers or spice. Our server was very awkward and did not make eye contact with us the entire time. I couldn't tell if she didn't want to serve us or if that was her personality. We were a party of six and our main plates all came out at separate times, about 10-15 minutes apart. For reference, we ordered chicken satay, grilled calamari, red curry with roti, and crab claws as appetizers. The roti was the best part of the appetizers. For our main dishes, we ordered 2x crab fried rice, 1x short rib drunken noodles, and 1x red curry salmon, and 1x Cho's fried chicken. The portions were average.

"I need to call it as it is. Probably the first 1 star rating of a Marriott property ever for me. I would probably title it something like ""putting lipstick on a pig"". I need to qualify this review first--- if you're born after 1980, don't take this review too seriously. If you're born before 1980, you may want to consider other properties. I was able to stay with one of my Marriott Reward Free Night Certificates. No way this should be 35,000 points. Maybe 5000. What was crazy was after my GPS took me there, I still couldn't believe I was at the right hotel. I reset my GPS and put the street location in, took off, and it took me around the block again. Depending on how you drive, it may take you into an interesting residential area you would probably not visit otherwise. This is a ""Design Hotel"". I get it!! Just not directly off the highway next to a Motel 6 and Travelodge. This was a remodeled hotel straight from Amarillo's Route 66. A true motor lodge. Millenials and Gen Z's would call this bougie or retro. I call it a rip off and overstated. It's not the Thunderbird Hotel of downtown Savannah. Now that's bougie!! Cut to the check-in process---- masks are optional, but staff was wearing most of the time. They have a mobile type check in process. Even though this was a comp night, they still took my credit card to charge $100 for incidentals. Did they recognize my Marriott status? No. Was I offered any Titanium perks? No.  My room was just slightly smaller than a college dorm. It did have a walk in shower which was difficult to get in and out of without hitting the toilet. A couple of long strands of black hair were on the shower tile. But that's not all. The toilet was never cleaned and flushed. An awful sandy residue was in it until I needed to use it. When laying in bed, I noticed a huge black fly on the ceiling. I was able to smack it with my belt and saw it land across the room. I hope housekeeping found it this time. With all the highway noise right outside my room, I was still able to get around 4 hrs sleep.  On the 1 star side, I called to find out where the fitness center was and if they had treadmills. The attendant said it was in the main area and had 1 treadmill. To my surprise, it was in the pool area and actually had 2 treadmills. They were probably the nicest treadmills of any hotel I'd stayed at. They were brand new NordicTracs. They also had a Peloton cycle as well as a weight room. The only thing they didn't have were towels.  For breakfast, I had their Lox Sandwich. It was very good.  Looking for other options for eating? There's a Waffle House within walking distance.

Though we eat here often and a staple Nashville restaurant I'm downgrading my rating. Place has consistently gone down hill over the past several months. Service totally depends on which server you get. Some are good but ours on Saturday night were not so good. Hair was dyed crazy and looked unkept which isn't good for handling food. Though the place was slow (especially a sat) we hardly ever saw our server. The manager walked by a dozen times as they prepared for a 25-top but never checked in with us. Should've noticed we were waiting for along time with dirty dishes. Food has become average if not a little less than average. This has not always been the case here so may eat here again in another month or two.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"More like tequila sunset. This is the most disgusting Mexican food I've ever had in my entire life. The guacamole was embarrassing -- it looked like rancid cole slaw and tasted even worse.

"My hubby stopped at Aversa's today and saw they had stuffed artichokes, which I make myself bc my family loves them.   I've been sick so my hubby thought he'd be saving me.   The stuffed artichokes he bought were absolutely completely different then the way I prepare them (which takes me hours).   These artichokes were a knock off cheap version.   Listen, I absolutely love artichokes and I will even eat them without being stuffed. But my kids love the way I prepare them, stuffed and cooked the way my Italian Gram taught me (Naples).   My kids wouldn't eat these artichokes that my hubby bought from Aversa's. They cut them down so small and stuffed them with stove top stuffing?!?  Then they charged a fortune for them.   Omg. Now I know if I decided to sell the stuffed artichokes I prepare I could make a fortune. (I wouldn't do that to people though.)  I give 3 Stars only bc the artichokes were fresh.   But listen to artichoke lovers who know how to steam, then stuff and bake:  Go to the Italian Market in Philly!!! You get HUGE FRESH ARTICHOKES for 25 cents a piece (4 for a $1)  Aversa's: Shame on u for charging so much!",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 3.0

"I took my mother to Bakersfield for Mother's Day and Bakersfield was just okay for me, my mother and brother.  I got the vegetarian tacos that had corn and peppers, not sure of the name of the tacos but it just was not a lot of flavor for the price that you pay for tacos. My mother got steak pork and chicken tacos her favorite was the pork tacos this steak and chicken she said we're dry. My brother got the steak and chicken tacos and said the same was you dry and not that flavorful.   They charge $4 per taco and it's not enough flavor in my opinion I like the location on Mass Ave but I took Bakersfield as a bar that sells average tacos.  The staff was not the friendliest. Our waitress never checked on us to give us refills or to see how our food was but it could have been because of the holiday. The waitress who greeted us was very pleasant.

Their pad kee mao is awesome! The portion size is pretty good, it really fills me up, and it's packed with flavor. I love the egg pieces. I especially love the basil; it's really what makes the dish, IMO.  They also have bubble tea that I'd like to try, but it's pretty expensive at around $3.95; given my experiences thus far with bubble tea in STL, I don't think I'm feeling quite adventurous at the moment.

We have been here a few times over the past 4 years and everytime it has been on point. From the BBQ Shrimp to the Boudin Balls for good appetisers. A favorite menu item of mine is the Fried Oyster BLT on toast or any of the specials, like the different fish plates served blackened or grilled. If you have enough room for dessert try the bread pudding. Yummy food! I'm not a drinker but a good glass of wine with a good meal can never hurt. Half price wine bottle special's are a big favorite.

"I think this location is better than the other one because it's bigger and I can actually find a seat. However, the place is really dingy from the ugly floor tiles to the foam ceiling. They tried to make it ""trendy"" by adding some cool decor however it does not work - the other location is definitely nicer to look at. They also could fit in more tables, but the layout they have is so unorganized.  I think the food overall is good (I like the salads and bowls) however portions are too small for the price. I also noticed that cleanliness was slacking, there was general dirtiness everywhere (floors, bathrooms, tables etc.) and the worst offense was the drink machines- they were covered in gunk/slime!

"I have been going to this place for over a year and kept my mouth shut as I would hate to see more people going there and ruining it for me with the long lines.  I am a perfectionist when it comes to Mexican food and this is by far the best Mexican food I have had in Reno since moving here from New Mexico in 1995.  I have tried some of the ""best"" Mexican restaurants here in the Reno/Carson City area and they ain't worth a bean.     It takes a while to get your food since it is made to order but it is has been consistent since I have started going once a week to this place for over a year.  The rice is made fresh daily and it is not dry.  If the rice is dry or is instant rice (hello crazy chicken) it won't be as good. One way to know if the rice is made from scratch in Mexican restaurants is that we (I am Mexican/American) add peas and or carrots to it for flavor and moisture control.   Try the tortas here...they are huge!!    The chile rellenos are made daily as well and they are made the traditional way.  That is they roast the peppers here and they dip them in egg batter before frying them.  At other Mexican restaurants they do not roast the peppers. This saves time, money, and effort but they don't taste as good.    For the money and the flavor this place is off the charts good plus they give you lots of food.    Call ahead to get your meal if you know what you are looking for as it will save you lots of time.   See you there sometime!!

"This is a lovely little Hilton property in the heart of the Cental Business District.  I had a one night stay this past weekend and I was lucky enough to receive it as a gift (prepaid), so I can't really make a comment regarding the cost in relation to value, but given that is the weekend of the Irish Channel parade and that Spring weekends are peak season in NOLA, I'm sure it cost a pretty penny.   I'd like to personally thank Marcus,  the evening manager that night.   There was a bit of confusion from the person who gifted me the room and Marcus helped get my name added to the reservation with ease.  (I know all to well from past experiences how difficult it can be when a reservation is incomplete or inaccurate).  Marcus made what could have been a complicated situation rather simple to deal with and I was glad to extend him a small tip for his courtesy.  (I'll do my PSA here- don't forget that front desk staff doesn't expect but certainly appreciates being recognized for a job well done).     My room was on the 9th floor and was an executive room with Executive Club Access.  The sleeping room was large, roomy, well appointed with modern furnishings and had a super comfortable bed.  It was like sleeping on a cloud.  The bathroom was also spacious and sleek with a large tub that I enjoyed a highly relaxing soak in.  (A random recommendation from me- a trial size bubble bath would be a great addition to the amenity kits -at least in club level rooms).    The executive lounge on the 7th floor was quite nice.  I had a full breakfast in there with juice and coffee and noticed the wine case for the evening hours and wish I had one more night to hang out in there.  There was also a complimentary billiards table and I'm sure if I'd have had time, I could have found someone to shoot a game with.  I'm a local New Orleanian and occasionally need to book a night downtown for special occasions instead of making my 30 minute commute home...if the rate is right, I'd definitely stay here again.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 4.0

"On a warm autumn evening, I rounded up some friends for an impromptu supper at Cafe Renata.  The Arabian salad was the surprise of the evening--fresh, crisp greens and tomatoes with a spiced lemon-olive oil dressing.  The wonderfully roasted sweet potatoes are also certain to please.  And the homemade creamy hummus was accompanied by pita chips and celery.  Unlike the supporting characters, the main entree was the underachiever--the cubano panini.  The baguette was not so much as crispy, as very hard and the slices of pork and ham (or lack thereof) lacked any smoky savory flavor.  The cafe menu is overpriced, but it's a needed sacrifice when desiring a quality meal in West Philadelphia.  Overall, the dining experience deserves a five-star rating.

It was very crowded probably due to the after work crowd, so it might be hard to find a place to sit. I did luck out with two seats at the bar though, which I am sure is rare.  The bartender was busy, but friendly enough. They have a decent tap list and also a great bottle list of craft, as well as usual beers like Bud or Miller.

Although there weren't many options for me as a vegetarian, I ordered the veggie burrito and thought it was great, way better than most. The burrito was filled with lots of veggies, mostly chiles and corn, with a portion size bigger than I could eat all at once. The only reason I dock a star is that we were pretty uncomfortable with the COVID safety in the restaurant. The tables were spaced together pretty tightly, and the server wasn't wearing a mask. Maybe she had been vaccinated? We weren't comfortable enough to ask, and opted to sit outside.

"I arrived in MSY at 2AM on a Thursday morning. I had not made a prior reservation with Aiport Shuttle, figuring if I could find someone at the airport who was also going to downtown New Orleans and wanted to split a cab, I'd rather do that and save some money and stress (having read the reviews here).  Pluses: - Easy to find. Signs are visible as soon as you come out to baggage claim. - Friendly staff. Despite it being 2AM, the lady at the counter was super nice. - The driver was very nice and helpful - only 20 dlls one way.  Minuses: - We sat in the shuttle at the airport for about 35 minutes, waiting for other passengers, before taking off.   What you need to know:  - They will assume you're purchasing a round-trip shuttle and will ask you when you depart. If you want a one-way ride, just let them know. The lady was very nice about it and said to call them if i ended up needed to book them for a ride back.  - It is a ride-share, so expect to be driven around before being dropped off at your location. This will add to your drop-off time and it is an inevitable aspect of this type of service.  - There was A LONG line of people waiting for a taxi at 2AM -- the 30-minute wait in the shuttle was actually shorter than the people who stood in line waiting for a taxi.  - I didn't book a shuttle ride back from my hotel to MSY since my flight was departing MSY on a Friday afternoon. You can take a taxi to the corner of TULANE & LOYOLA -- the N.O. Public Library -- and from there catch the E2 bus to the airport (takes about 45 minutes to get there) and charges you 2 dlls. Monday - Friday, this should be okay since the bus runs regularly during the day.  My cab from the French Quarter to Tulane & Loyola public library cost 7 dlls. Have exact change if you take the E2 bus (there's a walgreens across the street from the library, if you need to make change).",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 4.0

"I'm not usually a donut person but when I tasted Krispy Kreme Doughnuts back in the day, I had my first cravings for doughnuts.   Since I've been living away from Krispy Kreme Doughnut locations for a while, I really never had a donut... Until my sister in law (donut lover) visited me here in Reno and brought a box of doughboys donuts over.  I went straight for the glazed one and boy was I blown away. Compared to Krispy Kreme's, it is a bit more bready and less sweet(thinner glaze).   I was impressed at the quality of the donut. It tasted super fresh and clean. I also got a bite out of the other flavors my sister in law ordered and they were all the bomb.  They all varied with their sweetness, but all had authentic flavor. They have all your traditional flavors available and I think they nailed all of them.   So far, Krispy Kreme and Doughboy Donuts are about the only two donut places I'll enjoy.   If I'm going to eat a low nutrient food packed with fat and sugar, I would want them to taste as good as they can get.   I love that they open super early (5am) and that they have a drive through (handy when the kids are sleeping in their carseats and mom needs a pick me up lol). Customer service is always fast and friendly. They also sell breakfast sandwiches which I have yet to try and are located in a great plaza that has everything (UPS, AT&Y, Wal-Mart, lots of eatery places, Starbucks with drive through, Big O Tires, Learning Toy Express, CVS w/drive through).",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Lilly's was one of the first taco places I went to when I first moved to Santa Barbara, and after many years of trying different tacos, I think it's good but not one of the best. Their seasonings for all their meats kind of taste the same (even the adobada) and I'm not really a big fan of the steaming they do for most of their meats (eye, cheek meats). It's a personal preference but their grilled stuff is waaay better in my opinion and I think they should really do more of that. Their salsa's are also not the best, to me it tastes a bit watered down compared to a lot of the salsas that i've tried at other places (Mony's, Los Agaves, various taco trucks in LA/SD).   However, the thing that keeps me coming back over and over again are their crispy tripe tacos (only served on the weekends!). These tacos are probably the only reason that I keep coming back and the only reason why I go to Lilly's still. I have yet to find another place that can do crispy tripe as well as they can. As long as they continue to serve these crispy tripe tacos, I will continue to be a customer.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Overall the food was just ok, but more fast food(ish) than you'd expect from a sit down with a menu type place but should have expected this when I noticed (after already seated) they have a drive thru window.  Service started out strong but after getting our food the waiter never came back...ever...so no drink refills and someone else working in the back had to help us settle our bill.

I went here for lunch and not only were they able to seat us right away, the service was top notch.   The immediately gave us chips (multi-colored) and salsa (it came in a container which we got to pour into individual cups for dipping). The salsa had more flavors to it than any other I've had in Nashville. It had some kick to it, but nothing over the top. My drink was never empty either, they continually filled it.   The queso came pretty quickly and was very creamy. It was white cheese and thick as can be. I liked it though. I got the chimi changa and was surprised by how flavorful the chicken was. It came with rice, beans, lettuce and sour cream. Also, it was covered in a yellow cheese sauce. My only qualm was no guacamole. I actually didn't have any here at all, which I regret. Oh well, just another reason to go back.   My friend ordered the tacos, to which she said ""they have better meat than Las Palmas. Put that on Yelp."" Lastly, the bathrooms were SUPER clean. I was extremely impressed. Again, gotta say it, I loved the waitstaff. They acted almost like they were on a tip share. And, when we finished our meal and realized we had 15 minutes left in our lunch break, they didn't have a problem with giving us more chips and salsa to munch on while we sat there and chatted.

"Ugh, this actually pains me.  I had high hopes for this spot and was the one that recommended it for a group meal.  Left the restaurant w my friends being pretty embarrassed since I was the one that chose this overhyped spot.  This restaurant is just AWFUL.  Like all-around blows. Lets start with the service.  Pretty much everyone we encountered from the host to the waitress just didn't seem to give a sh%t.  It was like we were intruding on them in their own private home.  When I said the name of the reservation the host must of not heard me and responded with ""what?"". Really? ""What?""...WHAT are you 10 yrs old?  Learn how to hold an adult conversation.  This restaurant falls into the category of ""instagram type restaurant"" where it looks good in photos but thats about all thats good about it.  No substance.  No heart.  No real care to actually put in the effort but rather just to come off as if you do.  If you put half the amount of effort into actually caring that you do pretending that you care you'd probably not be getting so many bad reviews.  We sat down and it took a solid 10-12 minutes to get a drink order.  We got a few apps (lamb meatballs, burrata)...both nothing to write home about.  I had the burger that was bland and dry.  I can forgive a bad dish though.  I have trouble forgiving bad service especially service that seems systematically awful.  It wasn't just that we had a bad server.  Everyone was bad.  Not sure who runs this place but whoever is at the top needs to get a grip on this restaurant.  Overpriced, uninspired food with lazy, cold staff.

They have a fair selection of three red wines, one of which was organic but two of which were Cabernets and I avoid Cabs like the plague. I settled for a decent Shiraz, but really, this scene is just begging for rum drink sippin', so I can't fault them for their wine selection. The mojito list is impressive and Old New Orleans Rum is an option (and I highly recommend over that Cruzan stuff). There are plenty of fruits to add in to your drink, too. Blueberry, anyone? The bartenders are swift, friendly and because the bar is called Mojitos, you know they won't roll their eyes at you for ordering one.

The grilled octopus had grape tomatoes, lettuce, oil and hummus. The octopus was nicely cooked, but it tasted like rosemary or some herbs that wasn't to my liking and the hummus that came with it tasted powdery to me. It reminded me of of time I tried to cheat and use chickpea powder to make hummus. The beef carpaccio had some nice marbled fat blended in, with some cheese slices, arugula, capers, and cream. The cream made me think of mayo,and it ruined it for me. The meat had some brown. Maybe it's preference but I prefer lemon in my carpaccio. The spicy shrimp was delicious! Six shrimps and some bread to dip and eat with the sauce but we also used the sauce for the other foods as well. The octopus tasted good dipped in the spicy sauce ..wish they drizzled that sauce on the octopus instead of putting the hummus. The Tuscan rib eye was a standard steak but if you're craving a steak...tee off! The braised short rib just melts in your mouth but I wish they had 3 vs 2 Braised short rib pieces because ain't no one going to get full from that small amount. They Braised the ribs for so long that the bones were soft too! The Braised ribs were better than the Tuscan steak but the size is small. Clam linguini noodles are good. They have a taste thats not like the dry noodles you buy at the store but they don't give you a lot of noodles. They give a good amount of clams tho! I would say you go here to grab some drinks and some food but don't expect to get full unless you order a couple different dishes.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I was very surprised by how good this place was. The truffle fries are to die for! The service was wonderful. I got the Farm Salad with no meat added. When it came out it had some random chunks of chicken in it. The chicken was obviously not intentionally put in the salad... some pieces just  got in there.   I am a vegetarian, so that is not something I want on my plate. The waitress took care of it right away. A fresh salad come out super fast and the manager brought it to me. He apologized and was so professional. That made the experience for me extremely good.   Similar situations have happened to me at other restaurants. I usually leave angry because of how it was handled by the staff. Hands down Zinburger responded the best out of anywhere I have been.

"This place fails with everything! Absolutely disgusting! Words can not describe this terrible place! The standard the place offers is way below 2 stars it advertises. The price for the stay was way too much for the quality that was received. The way our room looked I would not have minded paying $30 for it. How to describe it, I don't even know what to start with...first after opening the door we were hit with a heavy cigarette smell. You could smell cigarettes mixed with very cheap air freshener that was probably used to kill the cigarette smoke, the smoke detector had its battery removed ! Everything was in terrible shape, walls had holes in them, not single thing was in an acceptable shape, bathroom was dirty and beyond any, even the lowest expectations. You had to be very brave to use something that resembled shower that was still wet and had debris and hair all over it. Every single thing here seems to be falling apart! We stopped here for one night only on the way to Florida and if it wasn't in the middle of the night we would never stay here. We paid over $100 and the room didn't even have a small refrigerator, well, maybe even better, I'm afraid to think what it would look like... Most camping spots offers better quality and cleanliness standards. I could not imagine a worse place.

I had a mimosa at first, I'm not sure if the mimosa or the champagne was bad but it was awful. I ordered a Bloody Mary after which is hard to screw up and they had in their Saturday special half price menu. The drink was super watery, didn't even finish it because it needed more tomato.

"This is my favorite Whole Foods of the area. The issues of grocery shopping at Whole Foods have been written about ad nauseam. I only buy things to fill in the gaps here but I must say I love their fresh peanut butter, pico di gallo, guacamole and mango salsa and I do splurge on all those.  I keep coming back to this Whole Foods though for the prepared food and the pub.   First the prepared food: I usually stay away from the salad bar but the sushi is decent and I like their burgers. I usually get the junior turkey burger (junior because otherwise its two patties.)   As far as the Cold Point Pub, wow, that place is wonderful! For most of the first year of its existence, I just used it to buy the occasional fancy beer and they do have a great selection.   Recently, I decided to try dinner and drinks at the pub. It is actually a lot of fun. They have pub food which you can't get in the rest of the store that is really good. The cranberry goat cheese salad is a strong version of what's become a very commonplace restaurant menu offering. They have specials. One night it was mussels, another crab and artichoke stuffed mushrooms. Both great.   My wife and I keep running into friends there. And the beers and wines are varied and good. Right now (January 2011) they have a wonderful coffee house stout that is a perfectly sweet and coffee tasting drink.  Its not Wegmans but when you throw in the Cold Point Pub in, it is an asset to the area.",Business Category: Grocery,Review Stars: 4.0
"I've frequented many taqs in my lifetime, but never have I laid foot into one that leaves me gasping for air -- just WOW! This place is just EVERYTHING: taste wise, price wise, quality wise, selection wise.   Everything about La Super Rica is just amazeballs. The tortillas here are made FRESH by the hardworking ladies -- that is so rare to find nowadays and almost unicorn like. I felt like I was being transported to Mexico where the street vendors still do things the traditional way. Hey not that I've been to Mexico myself but when I think of Mexican street tacos, that's what I visually fantasize. The mexican food here is outer worldly.   This was my first time in Santa Barbara and never would I have thought that one of my most memorable experiences here would be at a neighborhood taqueria. The mexican food here beats out a lot of the fare I've had in my own hometown which is blanketed with taqs on every street corner.  The findings: Tacos de bistec, chile relleno, la super rica especial, chorizo quesadilla , horchata.   Everything was just ridiculously bomb.com but I'd say the standouts where the chile relleno (the mild cream sauce was just perfection), the super rica especial, and the horchata! The horchata was one of the best I've ever tasted, not too sweet and just the right consistency of creaminess. The especial's marinated pork was delectable in every sense of the word and paired perfectly with the fluffy housemade tortillas and the peppers.

"Years ago, Noble Romans was expanding quite a bit and they over-extended themselves and had to change and withdraw from many areas.  Since then, they've gone into the pizza kiosk business like Cassano's and Godfather's.  You'll even see them in Florida inside convenience stores but trying to find one locally seems more difficult.  I've eaten at this location 6 or 7 times now and the food quality is always consistently high.  Of course, the pizza is the main draw but you cannot leave Noble Romans without trying the breadsticks and cheese sauce.  They're far better than any other place (pizza or Italian) I've ever tried.  I always order The Works on a 12 inch pizza and it's your typical deluxe/supreme combination of pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, onions, and green peppers but the crust is what makes it unique and extra tasty.  The people who work there seem to be there every visit and they're friendly and do a good job.  It's moderately busy at noon, but most are take-out orders apparently.  I've never had a problem finding a table, although I have had a problem finding a clean table.  The only other not so positive thing to mention would be the pricing.  It's high, but for lunch, they have several specials with small pizza (and breadsticks!), that seem more reasonable.  It's just too bad they're not everywhere.  I'd like to open one of their kiosks, just to have their pizza handy.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"A superb Magazine Street restaurant with a diverse, creative and delish menu. As part of a party of five, I had a grand time with attentive but never rushed service, solid traditional cocktails (old fashioned, corpse revival, and Vieux Carre received thumbs ups), and a casual contemporary setting. The proprietors have taken a double shotgun house and renovated it into a comfortable dining room with high ceilings--which helps so much with noise. A real plus.  The food certainly is a high point. The shrimp and grits appetizer was generous and among the best I have ever had in the city--rich spicy roux, bits of bacon and veggies with the shrimp not overcooked, yes! The autumn salad was another big hit--the apple and nuts really worked with all of the fresh greens.  Entrees were superb--two in the group raved about their seared scallops; two more thought the same about the grouper as the fresh fish of the day. I noticed at one time the only sound was knives and forks--everyone enjoyed their meals so much. I went with the smoked pork chop, mostly to see if the grill was a winner. Yes it is--spot on in the preparation and light on the sauces so the pork could command the plate. Perfect.  The entire table went for desserts and no one complained about the bakeless chocolate cake, the bread pudding or the strawberry cheesecake. I went simple with a creamy tasty sorbet highlighted by black berries.  Can't wait to try their brunch on the next trip!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I do love this food. It's not fancy, and it's kinda fatty. Service always good! Servers do not change every week, we see the same experts month after month. Coffee usually weak, the one time I said anything within hearing of the server, they went and brewed me a double strength pot without me asking for it. It was a nice thing they sure didn't have to do, but I appreciated it. I like the Old Timer's with scrambled/cheese, turkey sausage, fried potatoes, biscuits, and then steal some fried apples from the hub's order. The menu's a little confusing with all the options and the very similar combos,  so it does take a little time.  The store portion does tend toward the old lady stuff bought for grand kids, but occasionally I see something I'd really want, like an enameled cast iron pot, or ridiculously cute chicken thing.

"So we needed somewhere relatively inexpensive and fast to grab a quick bite on a Friday night. We had been to BurgerFuel for their soft opening but barely tasted a thing due to the crowd. Luckily, they were only moderately busy  and we were able to order and get a table with ease. Overall, it was good. The value for your money is good because the burgers are filling and they don't charge an exorbitant price for sides. The vibe is also pretty laid back and the staff seems to know their stuff.  I think an area of improvement could be order accuracy. My husband's order wasn't completely correct, which wasn't the end of the world but didn't enhance our experience.

"Man, Flemings is terrific.  Maybe it's something about that name, Fleming.  It implies James Bond (Ian Fleming wrote Bond, if you live under a rock) and now fantastic steaks every time.  This was my third trip to a Flemings, making it the most oft visited steakhouse by me, which is surprising considering it isn't my favorite.  But it's fighting for that spot.  First two times were in Sarasota - got a peppercorn crusted strip steak and the second time, I got a filet.  Strip steak was the better meal, but both were great.  This time, my girlfriend and I came in when we saw them advertising a summer menu for $39.95.  Came with a tuna tartar appetizer, a 6 oz filet and 3-4 oz salmon, and a berry shortcake dessert.  Naturally, being with a vegetarian, meant I got 2 filets and she got 2 salmon.  I love being a piggy at a steakhouse.  We also each got a glass of wine.  Everyone is going fancy these days.  Now, Flemings has their wine lists on an ipad.  It's cool because you can read a detailed description of each wine, but a bit annoying because it's easier to look at a wine list in a book where you can see all of them on the page, instead of just 5-10, and it's easier to remember which ones you were considering when you have an entire page in front of you.  That said, using them in conjunction (they still have the traditional wine list book, too) is perfect.  Find a few that look good in the book, then read the descriptions on the ipad.  Server brought me the old vine red zin I was looking at, which was very nice, and we both found wines we really enjoyed.  Tuna tartar is not an appetizer I would ever normally order, but if its part of a prix fix menu (or if someone else orders it), then I always enjoy it, and here it was no different.  Plus, you would thing that a 3 course menu for that price would involve smaller portions, but the appetizer was huge.  A thick layer of tuna on top of a big crisp and a thick layer of guacamole on top.  Think a gigantic sushi roll without the rice and served on a cracker/crisp thing instead.  It was delicious.  The steak couldn't have been better.  Entrees served on piping hot plates.  Filet's were crusted in a peppercorn something (I don't recall all the details) and cooked to perfection.  12 oz of filet mignon never went down so fast, and I tried my best to slow down and savor it, but it was too good to not devour.  The one disappointing thing for the meal was the dessert.  The cream and berries (blueberries and strawberries) were great, but the biscuit they were served on was baked with pistachio nuts, and why in the world would you do that unless you hate me? But, in spite of the fact that Flemings obviously hates me for that biscuit and the disappointing dessert, nothing could take away from the awesome appetizer and steak.  Flemings is a great restaurant.  Not just for the food and service, but the atmosphere is romantic, but still bright enough to be lively, and spacious so you feel like you're not being breathed on by other tables.  I admit that I have yet to go to the end all and be all of steakhouses in Tampa (Bern's), and I am anxious to go for the comparison, but how much better can you do that melt-in-your-mouth perfect?",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

My husband got hibachi (chicken and steak) and said it was pretty good. Enough food to actually make him feel full which is a great accomplishment since normally when he orders hibachi he is still hungry when he leaves. I ordered a few sushi rolls and they were absolutely delicious! I ordered the black dragon and the lucky dragon. Yummmm so so good! Definitely worth revisiting.

While there are other bike shops in town, this one feels like home. Seems like I see Bruce's Hazard tent everywhere a triathlon or bike race happens. Not to mention many of the local groups in town wear the Hazard's logo on their kits. Not just your local bike shop, but one totally immersed in the culture and community of Santa Barbara.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 5.0

Ordered this late night and I was very impressed. The chicken tenders were juicy inside and crispy on the outside. Delish crunchy French fries. My boyfriend got the buffalo chicken hoagie and it's huge. Also tried the sweet corn nuggets and they were different but good! The only thing we didn't like was the Jamaican beef patty. The pastry was dry and thick. We will definitely be returning! Great if you're craving fried chicken fingers and fries,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I've been to Sedona a couple of times. Once with a large group where we sat outside and have some drinks and apps and another time for brunch.  Sedona has a wonderful outdoor seating area with tables, ample bar space, and some comfy couches. We got their early enough to snag a couple comfy couches. Our server was fantastic and loved their summer cocktail list. I ordered the paloma (well actually ordered a few). It was tasty and had the perfect amount of tequila. Our intention was to only have a drink or two and then head elsewhere in Phoenixville, but we loved the vibe so we ended up staying a few hours.   My second visit I was meeting my foodie Meet Up group for brunch. The coffee is outstanding and I ordered the huevos rancheros. It was a decent portion size for the price. Service was a little touch and go sometimes, but overall was a good experience. The group liked their dishes and one of the women raved about the bloody mary bar and loved that there was bacon available.   It's a great edition to the Phoenixville area and looking forward to some warmer weather and enjoying the patio.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I'm honestly quite disappointed that this is the Hilton expression of the Embassy Suites brand in center city Philadelphia. This location could be converted to a Hampton Inn easily. While my 20th floor room offered me a fierce view of Logan's Circle and surrounding historic buildings, the customer service is not up to par with what I expect from a higher tier Hilton brand. It's obviously an older hotel, and this is reflected in the aging structure. Updating elevators on the weekend is a poor management decision. I missed my train to the airport and subsequently my flight... The breakfast was decent, not amazing and the staff was less than friendly. The housekeepers were dry and it was obvious they held some unknown resentment tithe guests. The elevator wait time is unbelievable.

"Of the 20+ rock gyms across the US in my 4 years of climbing, both indoor anx outdoor, this is bottom 3. I don't know if a lot of these reviews come from friends or employees but there are many problems here.  First the grading system is their own way of grading, follows no international standards for both toprope and bouldering. Everything is estimated on a 1-5 triangle system.....but some of the 3 triangle climbs are V1 and some of the 1 triangles are clear V2s. They are monocromatic, all holds are the same color for a climb, which is nice but they haven't been cleaned in so long everything is a dingy chalk covered gray. So it's not only hard to gauge but inconsistent. The toprope is one of 4 colors, but once again grading is inconsistent. Easy medium intermediate and hard. No 5.XX scale such as every other gym uses. It looks like the setter is relatively new since I can consistently climb 5.10/5.11s but some ""easy"" has large moves to a 2 finger pocket, or side pulls with a backflag to an iron cross type move on a medium. The employees assured me the hardest in the gym is a 5.11. I know it's Tampa but the gym has no ventilation or air conditioning. It's extremely humid inside to the point I had to step outside to cool off. At 2pm, the hottest part of the day I had to go outside to cooldown. The staff stays separate from the climbing room and cannot oversee anything for safety. I've worked for 2 years at a rock gym, we were constantly a presence to ensure safety and give helpful advice, they staff just sets you free. Because of this, there are a lot of younger, 8-12 year old, throwing things and running around sometimes under climbers. The only shining star this place has is that there are 4 auto belay and a rock climbing treadmill.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 1.0

"I have been recently initiated into the world of upholstering via a night school class. This is becoming my new way to relax.  Nothing like pulling out fifteen million staples and tacks to rid oneself of stress.  Also, my right arm is beginning to look like post-spinach Popyele's.   After an invigorating trip to Fabric Row, I found myself in need of supplies. Yes, I could order online.  Two reasons not to: First, I am a fervent supporter of small businesses. Second, I wanted to see what I was buying as I'm new at all this.  Thanks to the Fabric Row merchants and my dear South Philly Italian Aunt I learned Katz's is THE PLACE in Philly to go for the 'nuts and bolts' supplies (i.e. everything but the fabric).    Anyone who's a native or near native of Philly understands with some bemusement how neighborhoods' 'naming' changes over the years.  It's 'rebranding' and it's not a bad thing, just, well, confusing sometimes.  For instance, newcomers would say that Katz's is in Northern Liberties.  To the old timers - i.e., all the merchants on the Row and the South Philly Aunt, this place is in North Philly.  Understand, to old South Philadelphians, anything above Spring Garden is North Philly.    Katz's definitely in the rehabilitated area of NoLibs, with many new developments happening all along 5th street.  Being a business that has been there, well, almost forever, it's beginning to stick out a bit as a reminder of what the neighborhood used to be, before the Invasion of the Redevelopers.  The storefront is nondescript, with an aging sign and not much else to announce there was a business and it was open.  You might be fooled even to think the business had closed, leaving the sign behind.  Coming inside, the place is a jumble of fabrics and foam and workers bustling about chattering in English and Spanish.  They are quite pleasant to work with, if direct and to the point, and have a variety of qualities of product available.  Don't expect Mr. Customer Service here.  They are not salesmen, they are trade professionals. What I've found is that you get back what you give. I was kind. They were kind. Karma, people.  Bonus: they do deals on end runs. Need just a yard of high quality medium density foam?  No problem.  I happily worked with one of the guys to acquire all I needed, and he very kindly helped carry it out to my car for me.    FYI They also do re-foaming - you bring in your tired old cushions, they will put in new foam for you. Great way to bring new life into your couch!   Cash or check only, folks. They do not take credit or debit.    This is another stalwart  of Philadelphia's working past I am pleased to see surviving and thriving.  They deliver an essential part of our history as a fabric center and are a great resource for our city.  May they be there for a very, very long time.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 4.0

The service is great, and very accomodating for my elderly grandparents and large family gatherings.  My grandfather lived in Uzbekistan and he believes the food is authentic and spot on. Everything here is extremely flavorful, and the meat is always fall-off-the-bone tender.

"Maybe because we went during lunch vs breakfast/brunch I am missing something about the popularity of this place. Was very excited to try this place out today after my kids doctor appointments. Went into the restaurant which had maybe....3 or 4 tables of customers total...weren't greeted, ok...seated ourselves and waited for 5-10 minutes before I went to the counter myself to get menus. Mind you this is in a mostly empty restaurant where I had attempted to make eye contact or call over someone but just kind of was ignored. The waitress did apologize for this I will say. The lunch menu is really small, hamburger, one salad, a few sandwiches with fries. Salad could have just as easily come from a chain, I tried one of my child's  fries and it tasted like  straight oil that it was cooked in. We went to the bathroom a few minutes after the food was out, and when I came back the check was already on the table. Waitress was nowhere for the rest of the meal.

Located in the open of the Basement, it shares tables and space with the coffee shop and salad place.  Its all black, exposed duct work, and slightly industrial. Seems on the Hipster side, and oddly more guys ( in plaid shirts) than girls were hanging out there.  I don't mind the venue or decor.   Seriously though, this was the first time in my life I was served a chilled Pinot Noir. I have been to hundreds of high end restaurants, bars, and vineyards and have never had a red wine that cold. I did question the bartender and stuck to ""it's supposed to be between 58 and 63 degrees.""  I think that might be storage but not drinking. Oh well.   I did feel bad for Grace, but it is a bar.

I was in town for a friend's wedding, and asked for a simple polish change on my toes and fingers.  I pointed out to the technician that I had a Bandaid on my leg because I'd gotten stitches there a few days earlier; since she couldn't understand me, she grabbed that part of my leg hard in the process of doing my toes.

Even though shop hours are limited, she still gets 5 stars just for her unique business approach.

"My best friend and I were in Philadelphia today looking for a place to eat and were suggested Karma. The minute you walk in the vibe of the place is so positive and friendly. Our sever Mani was super nice! Service is also very quick; we got our food very shortly after ordering. Now coming to the food; we ordered vegetable samosas for appetizers, which were absolutely delicious along with that we were also served pappad with 2 different chutneys. For our main course I ordered the butter chicken which comes with white rice and my friend ordered the chicken tikka masala both those things were so so so good! I definitely recommend trying both. Their plain naan were really good as well. This food was like heaven in my mouth! For dessert we got the ras malai which was absolutely delicious also. Can't say anything about the alcohol drinks because I don't drink but I'm sure they're good too lol. All the people working there are so kind and go out of their way to give you the best dining experience. I will definitely go back to Karma! Added bonus - their masala chai and mango lassi is something you guys should try as well.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"If you like a doughy pizza, they make them. The meatball pizza is very good, but I don't like all the dough and how soft it is--I'm more a Brooklyn crust type. They're tortellini is ok but doesn't taste of high quality. It's very basic. Sandwiches are ok, but again it just always strikes me as too much bread. I never want more bread than other stuff. I consider it more a place you take your kid when you want to take them out for pizza, because you pretty much can't go wrong giving a kid pizza, especially if you want them to not fuss in a restaurant.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Went to Seasons 52 while visiting friends in Indianapolis. We ate in the bar and split a series of dishes and a bottle of pinot. The menu is vast and has nice options for all types of dining interests - fresh ingredients and nicely sized and priced. We shared a bottle of pinot, they have a nice wine list, and also enjoyed selections from their mini-dessert ""buffet"". We almost grabbed the entire thing, we had 8 out of the 10 or so desserts at our table and rotated our choices around. They were really, really tasty.   The bar is a piano bar, and the woman playing piano has been playing in Indianapolis since I was a kid. She sang Neil Diamond ""Sweet Caroline' and everyone in the bar was wailing the words like a wedding. It was quite entertaining, especially in such a ""nice"" restaurant. It's probably going to be the new Cork and Cleaver (showing my age).   The interior is nice, warm and arts & crafts era influenced. It'll be a nice place for a warm and cozy winter dinner. Turns out this place is owned by Red Lobster, but, you didn't hear that from me.  It made me sentimental for the old Keystone Grill, despite being a whole new building (again, showing my age).   By the time we left we ate well over the calories that they declare their meals being, heh, but, it was well worth it.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0

"Since the Castleton store closed this the Target I frequent the most.  I loved the $1 section at the front, it is almost impossible to go in there and not buy something from that section. Clever marketing and placement strategy.  Their grocery section is ok. I am not able to do my full grocery shopping there but it is ok for quick pick up of grocery items if you're willing to substitute in some brand favorites.  Their boy's section is just ok. Not a lot of option in my opinion which seems to be common for boy clothes. The younger/toddler section is better. The customer service today was not very good. The young lady at the counter (I was doing a direct exchange with a receipt) was almost mute. I am being sarcastic but it was like she was doing her very best to process my order with as few words as possible. Example, I asked her 2x if I gave her the right receipt, she did not answer at all. She had a smug look on her face and continued to do her thing. I asked her again and another questions tacked on to it she, again barely answered. Sigh. Whatever. I got done with I needed but it was a strange interaction.  I'll be back, no choice it seems as I don't always want to schlep to 116th street.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 3.0

But the worse thing was the German Chocolate cake, my mom baked we one on my birthday every year so it was a sentimental choice when it was on the menu.  I couldn't eat it.

It was so bad I had to throw it away. I should of paid mind to it because my first instinct noticed  it smelled like boo boo in this mutha fucka when I walked through the door of the fast chain.   While waiting  for my food the tables were not the cleanest either, again I tried to give them a chance.

"This place was packed on a weeknight, phone orders rolling in constantly, at least five tables filled, and one server to do it all! I was impressed with his ability to keep it all together and we still had a good experience without long waits for food.  We ordered some staples, shrimp spring rolls that were served with a warm very sweet peanut sauce, I like when you mix a little red chili to add some heat to the sauce, but these were fresh and yummy. The Tom cost soup was very flavorful, I like that they remove tails and lemon grass and this had veggies in it that I have not seen in the soup before. Zucchini, bell pepper, and eggplant wear a nice addition to a very familiar dish otherwise.  The pad Thai was sticky and saucy and very yummy. They had a lot of fresh veggies, onion, and peanut crumbles. The honey chicken was OK, it's basically a thigh that has been roasted or panseared, it was still nice and juicy. Served with fresh veggies and more peanut sauce. It was good, but not super exciting as far as Thai food goes.

A real plus is all seating is outside and the seating is plentiful, comfortable and in beautiful surroundings. Order at the counter, pick where you want to sit and they deliver to your table. Staff young, efficient, courteous and friendly. Note: we went on a Sunday (brunch time) and it can get quite busy, but a big plus is the relaxing atmosphere and a large gift/merchandise shop to browse.

"Although most Walmart's are normally crowded and busy,  this by far is my least favorite one to go to. Parking is always bad and you normally have to park at the back of the parking lot. The employees are unfriendly and don't offer much help with questions. I've stood in the customer service line twice for over 20 minutes because they are normally slow and only have one or two people working regardless of how long the line is. Whenever I have a store pick up from this location, there is always an issue finding my items or I have to wait in a long line to pick it up. Also, although customer service and store pick up lines are long, they don't let you purchase other items at these counters, so then you have to wait in line again.

"Oh Nail Lounge. Who do you think you are? I was super excited. I'm always looking for a new nail place. I left day by day with a belly full of turkey on croissant goodness and meandered down sansom. I lamented over Noble's passing. I thought about stopping in to peruse in sophisticated seconds, and then the shiny gleam of a new nail salon caught my eye.   So shiny. So new. So pretty. Essie. Orchids. Candy. COUPON!   I think I had just recently had my nails done, so they gave me a COUPON for my next visit.   PITA comes to town not so often, so generally when she is town we get our nails done every once in awhile. I said oh oh oh oh in the manner of a 4 year old lets go to the new place near village whiskey and when we are done we can get deviled eggs and pickles and fish house punch....yes please can we can we please please please i'll be good!  Well we stroll on over, and its dead. The girls working out number Pita-pants and moi. So, I kindly ask if they could maybe bestow the coupon on my unemployed working per diem for peanuts friend. Nope. Okay well what if I pay for both her mani-pedi and mine. No sorry.   No loss, we'll just go to any of the other twenty nail salons within a two block radius.   Seriously? You're new.

"I got my eye exam here. They do a thorough job and I had no problems. Very nice helpful staff. The problem is that most of their frames are pretty expensive. After the exam, I tried on different glasses and found a pair I liked. When I asked the price, they were $495 for the frames alone. I cant afford that even with an insurance discount. Sadly, for me, I dont think they have a large selection under $300. They do have some of the most interesting frames in town and this would certainly have to be a long term investment.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 4.0
"I hate to give a restaurant a bad rating for not having anything vegetarian (especially when a meat is in the name), but I'm only one vote.  I went with a meat eater, hoping that that HF would have at least one vegetarian meal.  They didn't.  Instead I had to eat a meal of sides: caesar salad, tostones, and yuca con something (I think garlic and butter).  Each was pretty good but not a meal.  (I didn't really want to order a caesar salad at a Peruvian restaurant, but I didn't have any other option.)  Also, before we ordered, we were served something like chips with a green dip.  The dip was great, but the chip substitute wasn't very good.  It reminded me a little of fried Chinese wonton crisps.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I mean how good could a burger be?  I have had some good burgers in my day but the burger at village whisky is on another level.  I mean most high end burgers are thick and juicy with a very good seasoned flavor, this burger was all of the above but the juiciness of the burger  was amazing. When I took my first bite the burger literally squirted across the small little round table we were given.  I have never had a burger that did that. I was talking about this place with a close friend and he said the same exact thing.  Also the burger wasn't too dense and the flavor was fantastic!   DELICIOUS!!  We got the fries with the brisket which I thought was too salty, it couldn't really taste the fries that they are apparently famous for.  We should have just gotten the regular order of duck fat fries, they looked crispy and seemed like they were served with some kind of aioli by looking at other peoples orders.  All in all the best burger I think I have had EVER!!!",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 5.0

We came here on Monday night, were one of three total tables in the entire restaurant, and still had really terrible service. After waiting almost 10 minutes just for someone to come to the front of the empty restaurant to seat us, we sat ourselves. Our server brought our drinks out halfway through our entree.

"Ok, I had never been to this event before, but I won tickets to this event through MOR at the Yelp party. So I had to go! Thank you MOR TV!   This event was previously held at the Curtis Hixon Park across the river, but this year was moved to the new Julian B. Lane Park. Tickets were approximately $20 in advance and $30 at the door. VIP was also available for about $100 with unlimited margaritas!  Look for my very valuable tip (for next year)at the end of my review!  VENDORS As you walked into the park there were vendors lined up in tents. I visited most of them, see my pics. Most gave out their branded merchandise Or discount coupons.  FOOD There were also some food trucks. Unfortunately, the lines to get food were a mile long. The corn on the cob was to die for! All kinds of different flavors that could be added to the corn. Also tried ZUKKI Sushi. By the time we got there, the only thing they had left was a shrimp rice burrito. It was good, but we were starving by that point.  MARGARITAS And then of course there were tons of margaritas. Some vendors had samples to try, but most were only for purchase, avg price was $10. The frozen strawberry margaritas were excellent, because it was hot outside. But we also tried the blueberry margarita, and it was awesome.  MUSIC Several bands played throughout the day, since it started at noon and ended at 11 PM. Nelly was the headliner act and started around 9:45 PM.  Very valuable tip: Buy tickets in advance and redeem the tickets for entry bracelets when they announce they are available (usually a day or two before the event). This will save you at least an hour of waiting in line!  All in all, we had a fun day... we ended up meeting about 15 other friends that were going. Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves :)",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 4.0

Honestly, if I didn't know better I would have guessed I was in New Orleans during Mardi Gras. I would have loved the chance to see some of the memorabilia in the different bars and restaurants but you couldn't even attempt to work your way around the room to see anything. It didn't seem to matter what time of day either - everything was packed from the time they opened well into the night. And if the bars weren't enough, the street was full of bicycling bars, bars pulled by tractors, bars on buses, and more. We were really disappointed, we had such a positive image of the city before we got there. Even the restaurants off the strip were packed and you had long waits for higher prices, seemed like everyone was out to take advantage of the tourists.

The crust is like a cracker, crispy but not like cardboard hard. Just right. The sauce is a little tangy, little sweet but not too sweet. The toppings don't overpower the base of the pizza . Does it beat my childhood favorite (Sal's on Market St.)?  No but it's pretty tasty none the less. It's different than the rubbery, Philly pizza joint pizza that's been heated and reheated for a week that you normally get in the city. The place is small. Not very much seating.

"This place has a true 5 star rating from me. This was my third visit for the lunch buffet that they offer daily. Upon seating, I asked the waitress which dishes contained eggs or dairy. She was thrilled to ask me if I was vegan (yes) and told me to hold tight while she happily asked the chef to confirm which dishes are vegan.  She came back to let me know the samosas (maybe only a weekend item for the buffet) served with chickpeas for a chat and two other dishes were vegan. She even apologized for not having more options and told me she would bring me roti for my meal. Super sweet and three dishes (for me, anyway) was more than enough as I loaded up my plate with each and walked out stuffed. It is a buffet, y'all, get your fill.  I was checked on by several servers throughout my meal which could've been because I was alone or because I had specified dietary restrictions/wishes. They do prepare their rices with animal products but I didn't miss it as I had roti for a nice carb source. They have lots of other dishes for people without restriction and dessert too. I am so pleased with this place and will continue to return each time I'm back in town.  I did read the review by another gal that was disappointed she felt misguided by eating rice that contained dairy when she specified that she was vegan. It seems that their entire staff is now on board with dietary accommodations and takes it seriously.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I'm very torn between a 3 and 4 star on this place. While our food was pretty good, it wasn't outstanding. I didn't order the fried chicken so maybe I missed out, but we did get the fried green tomatoes and I was a little disappointed to see them served with just ranch dressing (definitely tasted bottled, not homemade). I prefer a bit of kick to my sauce. There was some sort of season salt sprinkled on top, but it didn't add anything to the ranch. The tomatoes on their own were good though. Nowadays there are so many places doing delicious fried green tomatoes it's getting hard to compete.  Usually at these type of Southern, home cooking places I look forward to ordering the vegetable plate, but nothing really stood out as far as sides go. I stuck to the shrimp po boy and it was quite good. The bread was very buttery and delicious. The fries weren't great  Our service was so/so. I had to request more water a few times. When you are serving that much salty food you really need to be on top of the water refills.  It is definitely a decent option for dinner, but I think some of the reviews might be a little misleading. Is this place going to blow your mind? Probably not, but definitely a place I wouldn't mind returning to, maybe next time I will try the fried chicken!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Ummm I'm going this start this review off with categorizing this place  in the hit or miss restaurant.  I got here around 5:30 ish so I was excited.  I was on the hunt for chargrilled oysters and my friend told me about this place. So I was excited and ready. The hostess was such a sweetheart! ! He saw me with my son so he immediately went to get a high chair for my lil man. I was impressed.  Normally I have to ask for one. Then I sat down and was ready to drink.  I'm not talking about sprite! I had the BlackBerry basil margarita. It was very different.  Look wise and taste wise. Very BlackBerry bulky. I had chunks of black berry between my teeth. Lol. It was refreshing! However I didn't taste the alcohol really, but it was good just wasn't what I expected.  Heather was my waitresses and she was a good lady. Very attentive and heart warming.  I had a conversation with her about happy hour and told me that it is from 3pm to 6 pm. $4 well drinks,  $2 bottle beer, $2 .75 for draft beers.  The oysters were mediocre. I kept tasting a lot of the shell pieces in the oysters and garlic.   Wasn't as great as I had imagined. My son had the French fries  and he didnt eat much of them,  but I did and it was good. I hated the fact that mosquitoes bit my feet all up. But this is New Orleans and I am a New Orleanian so I was good in spirit and I was used to it.  I m going to have to try this place again because as a first time eater here the only thing that impressed me was the hostess bringing my son his high chair.  Very Baby friendly!! LOL! !

"My husband and I came to SCRC in hopes of becoming pregnant with our second child. We had previously seen a different fertility doctor in Santa Barbara to assist us in getting pregnant with our daughter. But there were certain situations and communication problems at that facility that made us decide to seek out a new doctor the second time around.   SCRC and Dr. Rychlik were great. The last year has been a roller coaster of emotions. There were many setbacks and hurdles to overcome, but Dr. Rychlik was dedicated and focused on helping us meet our goal of becoming pregnant. At one point I had lost hope and was ready to give up, but Dr. Rychlik assured me that there was still more we could do and that he hadn't given up on us.   The only criticism I have is that communication was not always as clear and prompt as I wanted it to be. When going through fertility treatments every phone call is a heart stopper. What will the results say? There were times I was expecting a phone call around 3pm and it didn't come till 5pm or later. Which always left me expecting the worst.  But overall, I would highly recommend SCRC and Dr. Rychlik to anyone looking for infertility treatments.

"Um, this place is the pits.   It looks great on the surface, with colorful wheel barrows marking parking spots and stocked looking shelves appearing to house everything your DIY project doing self needs, but then you step closer and discover they are actually out of what you want, as well as pretty much everything else that is not the most simple and highly sought after item.  Needed a bolt, staff was befuddled, so, after a goodly amount of time looking to no avail, I quit and decided to get creative and jury rig what I needed. It was bad enough that they didn't have the original piece I requested, but then the staffer informed me that they only had one lone 1""x3' length of all-thread in the entire store, which did nothing to solve my problems. The lumber is also lacking, especially when it comes to trim, and when I asked for cedar shims I was directed to two packs of some composite crap. I should also point out that the pluming section is overflowing with product, yet I had to go elsewhere for the parts I needed to repair a standard sink.  And it's all over priced.  I took it for granted before, assuming all true values were legit, but I guess the two stores near me in Philly have just spoiled me rotten; step up your game, Jerz, because almost every stop I made here was a fruitless waste of time.",Business Category: Home & Garden,Review Stars: 2.0

Don't ever go to this show. It is a waste of money. Fortunately I got 2 for 1 tickets but the price was $75. It was one of the worse experiences ever especially for the price. Lisa Marie Cole and I were treated very rudely. We pull up to the guard house and give them my name and they say it isn't on the list so gave them Lisa's name and then the young guard got snappy and was a huge asshole. I was trying to ask who to call to fix it and the guy totally yelled at me. Very poor customer service for sure. He made me and my friend fill like criminals trying to sneak into this community. It was the theaters fault they got my name wrong even though I had spelled it out for the guy on the phone. The guardhouse finally let us through and told us the clubhouse was straight up the road. We drove up the road like they said and ended up at a private property that said don't enter. So we turned around and looked again. Then called the theater for directions and the man who answered the phone was completely rude and unhelpful. He snapped that he couldn't explain how to get there to us and then said he had to find somebody else because he was busy. He passed the phone to a female and she was much more polite but still confusing. Kept telling us to use GPS but it wasn't pulling up. Then she like put us on hold forever. We finally get there. The best thing is the valet employee was super nice and let us park close to the door due to my friend using a wheelchair. He was very polite. Only good thing about the whole experience. We finally get to the theater and the woman at the door did listen and provide good customer service except for making excuses for the rude gate guard saying he was young. The valet guy was young and he was polite. We are seated at our table for the show. The magician is going around to everyone's table doing magic tricks but skipped ours and then he said he would come over in a minute and never did. Then the show started. It was super lame. It came off as sexist. There was a trick where they said let's turn this ugly duckling into a super sexy woman. They were only asking for male volunteers except for the woman who would be cut in half. They were putting women in stereotypical roles. We wanted to leave but thought we would wait for the food. The salad was served first. It looked nice but one salad dressing was way too sweet. The rolls were too hard. The main entree of chicken piccata was rubbery and tasteless like hospital food. We left. It was horrible an actress stopped us on our way out but we gave an excuse and left. This show was so terrible that I would have got more entertainment watching a $100 bill burning. Jack N Box tastes way better then this food and in general I don't prefer fast food.,Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 1.0
"Nice environment but just wasn't happy with the cut. I wanted this to be a good cut because I was getting married the next day. The girls are nice but the high skin fade I received was horrible. It looked like I had a straight line around my head, I wound up stopping at my barber the next morning and he fixed it up for me. I only went there because the reviews were good but when you only have one barber that can use a straight blade on your head you shouldn't be called a barbershop. I also paid $44 to have my beard cleaned up and this haircut and that was with 20% off. Crazy!!!!",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 1.0
"Recently visited Juan's with some friends on a Saturday. I expected seating to be beyond difficult, but we actually walked in and grabbed us a seat very easy. The waitress was fact and definitely helpful to my group. The atmosphere was laid back only problem, when its crowded the closeness of the tables can be a little annoying with people coming in and out. The food was great, never have bad experience with food here. I had the chicken quesadillas, my friends had the bean soul and mother of all burgers (which didn't seem the hardcore to me).  I must say the queso and chips are addictive.

"I've got to say that this place has gone downhill fast over the past several months.  It is rare that I give a place five stars, then have to downgrade it to three stars and then to one star.  Here's why.  Both the quantity and the quality of the food has been on a downward trajectory over the past year and the service/attitude is not hospitable.  The attitude was tolerable when the quantity and quality of the food was excellent.  Not so with it sub-par.    The specifics:  My go-to order has been the falafel platter. The price has gone up twice while the quantity and quality has deteriorated. When I first started eating here, the five excellent falafel balls came with a very generous helping of hummus and a plethora of vegetables and garnishes plus two hot steaming pita breads and a generous portion of excellent cut fries. The quantity and quality has deteriorated to the point where the (still excellent) falafel balls are accompanied by a tiny dollop of hummus, a few sad garnishes, a small portion of limp fries that could have been purchased frozen at Rouse's, and one clearly microwaved pita bread.   At $14 plus tax, the falafel platter is an expensive meal for a counter service restaurant.  From the looks of this place at prime times, people have figured out that it isn't a good value anymore due to the degradation of the food.  The people here have an attitude - they seem to expect 15% tips using the iPad payment device just for taking the order and bringing it to the table (no ongoing table service). Not friendly like other NOLA restaurants.  To top it off, Shahrazad Cafe recently opened across the street - excellent food, excellent prices, and a friendly and pleasant owner-operator who happily provides great table service.  I can have a much better, more filling, and more pleasant meal at a lower price at Shahrazad.  Sorry, Tal's, but I won't be coming back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Incredibly expensive, expect to spend about $2-3 more than you would elsewhere on most of the drinks and food items.   I almost didn't mind paying for the likely most expensive latte in Philadelphia when they used Stumptown espresso; it was that good. Since switching to (probably cheaper) PT's the quality has diminished so it's really not worth it anymore.  The food is hit or miss, some of it's good, but most of it is way overseasoned.  Most of the employees seem really depressed; not sure if it's part of the mopey hipster ambience they're trying to project or what, but they must not enjoy working there very much. Some of them won't even make eye contact with you, it's like something out of a creepy dystopian sci-fi movie.  The interior is beautiful though, definitely gonna steal a few design ideas for my loft.  But overall, I would avoid One Shot. Sweet Spot down the street has equally good coffee for about $2 less per drink and the staff is actually friendly and happy to see you. If you're looking for brunch, as someone else mentioned Green Eggs (same price, better food) and Honey's (same food, better prices) are better options.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"This is a very large dollar store with a very big selection.  It has significant amounts of foodstuffs and comes close to functioning as a grocery store.  It has a slightly smaller selection of office supplies, hardware, and the like, and it also has some kitchenware and party items.  Prices on food and grocery items, however, are not as low as I'd expect.  Prices on other items are better, but I find that the quality on a number of items is lacking.  I would prefer this place to be a little more selective of what they carry, carry more high-quality items, and avoid carrying the items that are priced similarly to what you'd find in a grocery store.  That said, this place is still pretty decent and is always a pleasure to visit.  I find I prefer the new-ish dollar store on Baltimore just a bit south of here to this one.  It is smaller and stocks much less food, but I find tends to have more deals, especially because it carries more high-quality merchandise, including a surprising amount of American-made stuff.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 4.0

I ordered the crab/corn chowder and unfortunately wasn't a fan. It had a weird sweetness to it, and an odd aftertaste. My husband ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai, which I stole a lot of (it was delicious!). The other couple ordered several varieties of the market fish, which were both lovely.

The mac and cheese was definitely a good one, rich, cheesy, and creamy, as it should be!  The Cubano was tasty as well, roasted pork, ham, and Swiss, pressed like a panini.  My wife loved her Gambino, which was a selection of their house meats with a herb vinagrettte, and I'll admit that it was great as well.  They didn't go skimpy on the meats with this one for sure!

"Yesterday I visited here and when I left I needed to update my Top Ten list of great bars of all time!  The atmosphere here is just the way I like it.  I felt like I just strolled into a bar in Tijuana.  It has a great dive bar feel.  The furniture and décor is slightly beat up.  The crowd was incredibly eclectic.  We had men, women, young, old, blue and white collar, tats and polo shirts and even a tie or two all mixed together.    Whenever I visit a new Mexican joint I order a house margarita.  This one was served in a heavy glass cup and was perfect for $4.50.  Of course I was sipping on it while munching on the complimentary chips with two salsas.  As I perused the menu I spotted chorizo tacos. Chorizo is one of my favorite foods.  It's made in several countries with different spices and even different meats but the Mexican version is my favorite.  The guy that invented it should be made a saint.  That way I could wear a cool little medal around my neck.  I can see in now; Miguel XXX, the Patron Saint of Chorizo.  Anyway the chorizo tacos arrived.  Three warm doubled soft tortillas stuffed with meat, onion, and cilantro.  I could have added extra toppings for 50 cents or so each.  They were spicy and near perfect.  Easily some of the best tacos I have ever consumed.  So I had great tacos and a strong margarita in a great atmosphere.  Oh, the bartender was just fine.

Every bite gushed with cheesy goodness and the richness of the croutons was cut through with some bitter charred greens which gave it some balance.   For entrees, we got their spaghetti and meatballs which they're known for and their gnocchi. Both of the  pastas were a little overcooked for my taste.

I've had homemade sweet spaghetti before and I have to say this was better than that. The sweetness was less overpowering. I was pleasantly surprised and would order it again. The spicy chicken was a good size drumstick and well cooked. It was crispy but not dry. The spicy flavouring was noticeable but wasn't too much. The gravy is a nice touch and certainly adds to the flavour once the skin is gone. The juice was well chilled but didn't quench my thirst the way a carbonated drink would.

"I seriously don't think this place is all that. I believe a bit overated to be four stars. Sorry. I remember walking in, it was a bit crowded. There was a wait to be seated in the dining area, so of course... forget the wait, and let's sit at the crowded bar! We told the bartender that we were going to eat and drink, so he sat us down instantly.  We ordered the Oyster Rockefeller, the Fried Seafood Platter, and the Seafood Jambalaya. And of course beer.  The Oyster Rockefeller was probably the first cooked oysters I ate for the week. It was cooked with Spinach, Bacon, in Perdon Liqueur, and was topped with Parmesan Cheese. Yes, I was a bit oystered out already... But it was still good. Truthfully, these oysters were cooked... And I'm not really into cooked oysters, and secondly... It's too rich for my appetite. It really made me feel bloated, and we weren't able to finish the dozen.   The Fried Seafood Platter was just okay. It really wasn't a big deal. Nothing extraordinary either. I could probably order the same stuff anywhere. Yes, a bit on the greasy side and too rich for me. Couldn't finish this order either.  And third, the Seafood Jambalaya was delicious! It looked pretty bland when it was brought over. Very flavorful, and also a bit too heavy with all the Jambalaya ingredients mixed. But don't get me wrong about this dish. I liked it.  I think all the things ordered was decent. Maybe we should have ordered something lighter to help digest easier, or just order two out of the three and beer.  This was actually the first time I was so thankful to drink beer. And lots of it too. Their catch is to prepare the food very hefty... So you'll order more beer. Lol.  Oceana is a small place. It was very crowded when we got there. Everybody was quite friendly, including the patrons sitting around the bar. I was able to chit chat with three different people at the bar. One guy was probably either drunk, or ran out of things to talk about with his date, so he started talking to me about my food, another guy sat next to me after and started talking to me about sports and health & well-being, while a third was a gal from Texas, who stood next to me and asked where I was from.

"So happy I found Dentistry in Oro Valley!  We're new to Tucson, and I went here for a second opinion after not feeling comfortable with another dentist, and I am SO glad I did!  First of all, the staff in this office are not just great but phenomenal!  It's unusual to have such great staff so consistently.  I dealt with Courtney at the reception desk primarily, and she was very helpful and informative, and got me in the NEXT DAY after I called, but there was another front desk staff member who was also quite helpful and pleasant.  Really, everyone, I'm not kidding.  The technician who greeted me was pleasant and very personable, and thorough.  The hygienist was fantastic, no pain or sensitivity during the cleaning (I usually have a little sensitivity), and she was personable and informative without lecturing me.  And of course, Dr. Sokol himself was great.  Gave me his honest evaluation and a straightforward way, I trust his judgement and felt completely comfortable with him.  It's a bonus that it's not that far from our house, and a bigger bonus that they are reasonably priced and very easy to w  In short, they've absolutely won me over as a customer and I will be returning there for all my future dental needs, and recommending this practice to anyone who asks.  Update:  So I went back for a periodontal scaling, and I had worried it could be painful, but it was not the least bit painful and went really well!  I just wanted to update my review because today's experience was so great, I was so relieved that the procedure went smoothly, and I continue to enjoy coming to Dr. Sokol/Dentistry in Oro Valley.  The staff are great, Courtney, really everyone including Dr. Sokol himself are great.  But today I believe it was Haley (hope I got her name correct) and she was great!  Really put me at ease, I didn't even feel the needle when she administered the novocaine, I had no pain at all during the scaling, it was just a smooth and pleasant experience.  The whole staff are professional and caring and personable, and that includes Dr. Sokol himself.  He's an excellent dentist, he doesn't push unnecessary work, the prices are quite reasonable, they run things by insurance in advance so you know what you'll be responsible for financially.    I ran screaming from another dentist that I really didn't like at all and that's how I found Dr. Sokol and his office and I'm very fortunate to have found them.  I highly recommend this dentist and office.",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 5.0

"Good ol southern juke joint! I had fun here. I noticed the lounge while trying to get to Bourbon St, the place was packed on a Saturday night so wanting to party w/the locals and not tourists this place looked perfect. It's 25 and older and definelty an older crowd in here, which from time to time I can appreciate an old school party. They played a variety of music genres and even took requests.   All the employees were friendly and they knew we weren't from around there. We ordered drinks and left. We then came back after Bourbon street because the owner told us that they never closed! Which at 4am these people were still going strong. We ordered more drinks and then we ordered chicken to take back to the hotel w/us. I wanted fish, but it was sold out. THE FOOD HERE IS GOOD!!!! Chicken came w/fries and a salad at 4am! This place is the bomb for late night creepers like myself.   We came back a 3rd visit on the next day and was treated the same like family.

I've read all of the reviews and had to weigh in.  To start our server Remy was amazing.  Attentive without being overbearing. (A shame she is leaving in November)  We started out with the scallop app and we both thought that the strawberries and spinach paired very well with the spot on scallops.  Then we moved onto the hanger steak and the blackened pork.  Both were exactly the way we ordered and extremely tender and flavorful. (I really enjoyed the plantain polenta.)  We would go five stars on SoDo if they could have done my lady's Cosmo properly.  On the first go around they had forgotten the lime juice and triple sec and on the second go round it was still missing the lime juice.

"First of all, reservations are recommended, as it is a small space that fills quickly. However, for small parties it isn't hard (yet) to get them.  Service was prompt, courteous, knowledgeable, friendly, and most importantly: unobtrusive. The decor was stylish and modern while retaining a close, cozy feel; upon entering, one is greeted with soft light and subtle scents of comfort food.   My dining partner and I split an order of the chickpea fries to start, which were delectable! Crisp on the outside, light and creamy on the inside, and perfectly seasoned. They came with a romanesco sauce that, while not needed, added another layer of interest. Also worth noting is that they came out in a delightful wooden serving block, carved with the restaurant's logo. Excellent presentation! We also stuck to cocktails for the evening: I had a gin fizz while she had a Bee's Knees, which was not dissimilar to a gin fizz, but with a lighter, more aromatic sweetness. Both were well-prepared and -presented; I had a second one, in fact.  For my main, being vegetarian, I had the Vegetarian Scotch Egg, which came on a bed of spaghetti squash alongside a collection of various sauteed mushrooms. The mushrooms were intensely flavourful, the squash strands were done better than I've ever had, and while I have no non-vegetarian reference, the Scotch Egg was hearty and interesting without being over-complex. I'm not entirely sure what the delicious filling was made of, but the fried breading was done to perfect crispness, and the soft-cooked egg at the core was wonderfully done. My partner had the Rosemary Braised Lamb Shoulder, which came with a wheatberry crumble, potato pave, and a selection of exquisitely cooked seasonal vegetables. The lamb was fall-apart tender, very flavourful, and its soft texture contrasted wonderfully with the crisp rosemary coating. The wheatberries added to the textural contrast, but being a fairly neutral ingredient, are by nature a bit bland. Along with the excellent seasonable vegetables, both the celeriac puree and the potato pave were cooked and seasoned to perfection.  The portions for the mains were generous -- the vegetarian entree was a bit on the lighter side, but still satisfying -- but we had to try some dessert. They have carried a wonderful-looking bread pudding since their opening day, but have recently changed over (the online menu hasn't been updated yet) to a sticky fig pudding. It came out, in proper tower form, and while it looked unassuming, it carried a load of warm, rich flavour. I would certainly recommend sharing the dessert, unless it is the only thing being eaten. It was moist and dense while not being over-heavy or sweet, and was accompanied with a perfectly-paired caramel sauce. An excellent end to a wonderful meal.  The four star rating tells my overall impression, but I want to add as well that as a casual fine dining restaurant it also has a good value, with two entrees, three cocktails, an appetizer and dessert coming in under $120 before tip.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"My fiancee' and I were on a very long road trip and had VERY poor service at the other towns we stopped in prior to getting to the Peppermill (much later than we expected due to inclimate weather).  A charming young woman ( Jenn) welcomed us at the front desk, made sure our room was exactly what we had reserved (a room in the new redecorated Peppermill Tower).  We walked into a beautifully appointed room with a four poster king sized bed (that was MASSIVELY comfortable), a two person hot tub, a nice sitting area, a good sized bathroom and a nice view of the city.  Everything looked new and was so comfortable.  We jumped in the hot tub for a bit, then headed out to Oceana for dinner (recommended by the front desk staff).  The decor in the restaurant was fun and lovely.  Our waiter (Sal) was informative and very nice.  My fiance' ordered the specialty drink of the night and the waiter came back to inform us they had run out of one of the ingredients but that the bar staff was running over to a sister restaurant to get the needed ingredient and apologized for a slight delay in getting his drink to the table.  It was a bare five minutes later when we got served his drink.  It was so impressive that they went to all the extra trouble for one drink ingredient.  The lobster bisque was divine, creamy and full of lobster chunks.  The ceviche was VERY tasty and was a more generous portion than a normal appetizer portion and the hot tuna sushi roll was excellent. A big portion of sourdough bread was served promptly when we sat down.  After all the delicious appetizers, we only split the chef's specialty  of the night, parmesan crusted sea bass.  This dish melted in your mouth and had a nice side of steamed vegetables with it. Again a generous portion.  We passed on dessert and even though because of our late arrival, we were the last guest in the restaurant, not once did we feel rushed so they could close.  We left the restaurant and spent the rest of the evening gambling.  They had several $5 and $10 blackjack tables and plenty of slots.  While one deck blackjack was NOT my friend this trip, the dealers were fun and our companions at the table were easygoing and made losing my money a lot more fun  lol.    We will go back to the Peppermill again and again now, and we would highly recommend the little extra it cost to have a tower room with the hot tub!

"Saw ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" here in 3D, and it was unquestionably the very worst 3D experience I've ever had in a theater.   The polarized lenses of 3D glasses mean that the brightness of the image is divided, and a reduced light level enters each eye separately. For 3D to appear to be as bright as a 2D experience, the bulb in the projector needs to be much brighter.  The projection equipment at this theater was extremely poor quality. I have a hard time believing that it was even bright enough to project an ordinary 2D image. The picture was very, very dim, and at the edges appeared entirely gray.

"Pluses first.  In fairness, their location was good, and we attended a conference that was excellent.  Our room was clean, and stayed that way due to an excellent housekeeper.  We really liked some of the servers in ""13"" and Eric, in the FedEx office, was fantastic: kind, professional, helpful.  Wu, our bellhop, was fantastic as well, when we arrived: professional, welcoming, friendly. OK--here it comes. Cons included a lack of air conditioning in one of the conference rooms (that's the first time I've enjoyed an excellent conference session while simultaneously wishing it were over!).  There was also a noticeable, ""I don't care, so stop bothering me,"" attitude among some of the staff.  One day, I ordered pretzels at the bar and the bartender said, ""I'll bring them to you.""  After waiting ten minutes (and a fairly decent tip) I finally ventured over to the bar and saw them sitting there.  Asking, ""Are these mine?"" yielded just a ""yes"" response--no apology, no explanation.  (Maybe ""I'll bring them over"" means something different in Philly than in L.A.?)  And by the way, I'd requested those pretzels ""to go"" at the restaurant and was re-routed to the bar in the first place!  Plus, $10 for five pretzel sticks is a little expensive.  What are they made with--gold dust?  (Obviously, we weren't paying extra for service!) The following morning, we arrived at ""13"" for a brunch.  One of the hostesses wandered over in a very lackadaisical way and said, without so much as a ""good morning"", ""We're only serving the buffet now.""  We concluded that she was annoyed by the idea of our business, and took it elsewhere. But the topper?  We had a fairly large package to ship back to our home in California by FedEx.  We came downstairs to one of the two FedEx offices, lugging the package, after the time it's posted to open.  No one was there.  So, my husband took the package to the front desk, to ask if they could keep it for us while we ate breakfast.  He was told: (1) ""Oh, they usually email if they're going to be late.""  (2) ""They haven't emailed.""  (3) ""No, we can't keep a package for you here at the front desk, that's not our policy"". Fortunately, there were TWO FedEx offices there, and Eric, the assistant manager in the one that WAS open at the hours posted, was, as noted before, fantastic.

Went here for ""happy hour"" on a Friday, and were hit with a gift card sales reminder from the hostess as soon as we walked in the door. Then, the DJ made various announcements selling the gift cards. Oh, there's also a girl walking around selling high priced tropical drinks. SELL, SELL, SELL!! The ""happy hour""includes a pretty good buffet for the price of a 2 drink minimum.The problem is, the drink prices!! I had a draft beer Stella Artois that cost $7!!!

"I was sooooooo pumped to try Chop for the firsy time today. It's a place I've been wanting to check out since I moved to Edmonton 3 years ago.  It was sooooooo underwhelming. If it wasn't for my lovely company I would have rated it downright poor. But we had a good time regardless.   FOOD : The food was what I came for. From what I've heard THE FOOD at Chop is where it's at. My food was very very meh. Meh to the point that would pay never again pay that for such a mediocre meal at Chop. So meh that I wouldn't return just based on the food. Never mind the rest of the paltry experinece. My date and I were both severely disappointed with our plates.  We both got steaks which comes with choice of potato and 'seasonal vegetables'. The 'seasonal vegetables' were seriously a half cherry tomato with some green garbage sprinkled on it and fried canned French's onions. What the? My friend raved about the Wasabi mash. We both ordered it. We both hated it. There was no detectable Wasabi,  the potatoes were dry and cold and lumpy. We both asked for a side of butter and even butter couldn't save potatoes. When did butter ever let potatoes down?! The waitress brought us new batches of potato? Which were equally bad with some strange sour note. We were comped desserts, which is something,  but I don't want a damn dessert. I never order dessert. I ordered a delicious meal.  I wish I could comment on the Crab Jar dip that I ordered because it's crab specials til May ay Chop and there are many delicious crab items on the menu. Well like I said. I wish I could comment, but the waitress never brought it. She didn't remember the app I ordered off the FEATURE MENU. I assume it's because she was a brutal waitress from start to finish. We came in at 330 pm on a Monday. It was dead, dead,  dead, as you would think on a Monday at 330 pm.

"The best way for be to describe this place is just very odd.  When We first came in no one was at the host stand so we walked to the back of the restaurant. The waiters passed us but didn't stop to even tell us to wait a minute. We had to stand there a little while before we were finally seated. We were put next to the window which had obviously never been finished right because there were huge gaps letting the cold air in.  The whole week they were only doing the restaurant week menu  apparently, which is a shame, since we really would rather have just done entree and dessert, but we ended up not even completely finishing our entree. The food its self was fine, but not really anything to write home about in my opinion. They did however mess up my order and realized this and grabbed my plate away after having it sit in front of my for a bit. I think one of the biggest things that bothered me tho was i guess the ""ambience"" you could say. Its a french restaurant and yes, when you first come in there are a few ""french-ish"" pictures, but thats pretty much where the french stops. The food itself wasn't necessarily french (I had hummus with pita chips for an appetizer-not at all french in my opinion). The dining room we were in was also decorated with some tin-looking material on the walls - the whole room was just kind of odd. When we first came in there was no music on at all and then about half way through our meal they seemed to realize this and put on some latin music. At that point I was thoroughly confused as to what type of mood they were trying to set.  It was all just very odd.

"Went there recently, hoping that ""good for children - NO"" meant just that, i.e. no cranky toddlers within earshot.  The ambiance is sleek and modern, the waiter was attentive, but within a few minutes we were greeted by loud noises from a toddler who had apparently found his voice and was going to use it.  I saw no children around, but there were two toddlers, side by side in highchairs, adjacent to the sushi bar.  Apparently the acoustics of the place are such that high children's voices travel far and loud.  We asked a waiter if they normally had children in the restaurant; he said yes, unfortunately this had become a trend lately, and created a certain amount of disturbing noise around the sushi bar which is where they apparently seat these folks.  We ordered only three dishes a la carte, the mountain roll which had some sweetness to it (sugar in the rice? ugh), a vegetable chow mein (swimming in a dark soy sauce), and the walnut shrimp (drowning in a cornstarchy gummy sauce).  The waiter was most attentive, pulled out my chair, hot towels at the conclusion of the meal.  BUT, what good is even a good meal if you feel you're eating in a romper room or chucky cheese.

I love the decor - it's sleek and modern with rich jewel tones and dark woods.  There is often live music in the evening...jazz mostly.  They have an enjoyable happy hour most nights and you can enjoy drinks and appetizers at the bar for reduced prices.  The service is extremely friendly, attentive and top-knotch in every way.  We have been to Blue 2O about 5 times and we are always delighted.  The only downside is the prices are a bit high, especially for dinner.  A full dinner for two with appetizers, entrees, a couple drinks and desserts will run you around $125 or more with tax and tip.  If you go at lunch, it's a little more reasonable and the quality of food is just as high.  I think the last time we went for lunch, our bill was around $50 - $60 with tax and tip.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"The Blinds Brothers team were professional and courteous and did a great job. Yehuda came to the house for my initial consult. I have a tendency toward analysis paralysis; but he and patiently walked me through my choices and helped me come to a conclusion without ever feeling pressured.   The blinds arrived within the promised time frame and were installed today.  I'm so sorry I don't know the name of the installer. He showed up on time, and got everything installed including the curtains and curtain rods that I got elsewhere. He cleaned up thoroughly and even helped me figure out how to use my new composter - definitely not in his job description! Such a nice guy!   Everything looks great and works perfectly. I highly recommend them.",Business Category: Home & Garden,Review Stars: 5.0
"Hole-in-the-wall is right! This place is right across from opal sands resort so I thought this would be a great place to walk over to for lunch. I was a little worried because the building looks old and ran down. Walking in I was nervous because the inside didn't look much better than the outside and it smelled not so good. I was almost ready to leave.  With some doubt, we continued to stay and order, and I am so glad we did! This pizza was awesome!!! I even ate it the next morning cold and it was still good! Compared to other restaurants in the area, I got a great meal for a great price.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
The food is reliable and good for the area. The lack of adult management and/or supervision is the problem. The young women at the counter are not pleasant to deal with . No one is wearing a mask . I witnessed them dropping pizza boxes on the floor multiple times and putting them in the *to be used pile. When I walked in I paid and was told it would be a few minutes. 15 minutes passed and she had apparently forgotten who I was and asked me what I was  waiting for even though I was the only person in the shop.   Two days later similar experience.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
In love with this restaurant! Great place for lunch. Lots of specials. I am a vegan and loved all of the choices and how the menu is labeled. I had the lentil soup (amazing) with a falafel toasted pita sandwich and fries for $1. It was all $11 and so bomb! I will save half of the sandwich and the free delicious pita bread for dinner!

"""One of the Best Vegan Burritos I've Ever Had"" We had excellent vegan and vegetarian burritos here, the pico de gallo was fresh tasting and the guacamole was perfect. The veggies in my burrito were delicious, and the rice and beans on the side were super tasty. Our waiter was very funny, teasing me about cheese and sour cream being added to my dish when I specifically asked for it be left off. I thought he was charming. He was very solicitous and pleasant. Waited on us hand and foot. My boyfriend could tell his margarita was not freshly made, tasted like a bottled mix, but he still said it was good. We both had plenty of dinner left over to take home, so it was definitely two meals in one. Highly recommend this place.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Usually I have to go all the way to Port Richmond for pierogies, which is why The Pierogie Kitchen in Roxborough had been on my list for a while as a closer alternative.  Though I missed the Polish granny vibes you'd get in Port Richmond, it's a cute shop. It is really set up for take out purposes , which we didn't know going in. Far enough from home and too hungry to wait, we ate at the sole customer table anyway.       The idea of a pierogie inside a sandwich was too decadent to pass up. Also, the Original Stacker sandwich comes with all the things you might want from a basic Polish meal, potato and cheddar pierogies, mustard, and  sauerkraut. For $7.50 this is a really filling sandwich with a fully stuffed pierogie on each sandwich half and an ample amount of flavorful smoked kielbasa. This sandwich packs in a real buttload of kraut, almost too much for me and I love the stuff. It's easy enough to scrape it to the side if need be.  Does a pierogie need to be in a sandwich? I wouldn't give that a definite yes, all of the ingredients could have been enjoyed separately but this was a cost efficient way to get a bit of everything. Plus,  if you value a more vertical meal, with a bit of everything in each bite, this is for you.    Even with the small menu, there were a lot of items I wish I had room to try (Mushroom Potato Horseradish pierogie, borsht), so I'll have to come back. But I couldn't pass up on the Chocolate Ganache Pierogies. Though I wish the dough was a little sweeter to match, the hot, oozy chocolate was decedent. It even worked cold when I got hungry again a few hours later.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 4.0
"The service here is very shoddy. When I arrived, instead of somebody leading me to a table, the attendant on duty said ""just sit anywhere"". The tables were empty, so you have to go get your own silverware, napkins, etc. They bring you water, but nobody comes to ask if you'd like something else to drink. After eating, nobody brings you a bill, you just go up and settle with the cashier. As for the food, it wasn't too bad, but the sauces were thin and runny, and the selection was not all that great. After all this, I was flabbergasted to find the price was $15 per person, not the $9.99 that I saw advertised on this page.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I am giving 3 stars, not because of the food but due to the service. I went with my wife and friend for lunch on a Sunday. We were the only patrons in the restaurant and decided to eat in the outdoor section in the back. It is gorgeous back there with beautiful mosaic art. Having lived in an Asian country, I found the food to be very authentic and not too Americanized. The spice was right, the meat was tender and the portions were huge! The server, however, was a bit standoffish and didn't seem as if we wanted to be there. When asking about WiFi he said they had it but he didn't know the password. We asked a little about certain dishes and he was unwilling to explain further. I will certainly give it another go, but might get take out instead of eating in.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I came here for breakfast on one of our days at Clearwater beach since we were staying at the Hyatt Regency so we usually ate breakfast there but one day we decided to venture out on a walk along the pier and stumbled upon this place. It was a little muggy to sit outside so we did decide to sit inside where it was nice and air conditioned but it's nice that they do offer outdoor seating. Upon arrival, the hostess and servers were very sweet and friendly which is always nice at a little family breakfast place.  Now onto the important stuff, the yummy food. Breakfast food is important and they do it quite good here. We ordered the bacon stuffed pancakes and a swiss, spinach and mushroom omelette with their signature home fries. I was seriously very happy, the pancakes were sweet and tasted like heaven so I'm really a fan of the batter. The bacon bits were also cooked perfectly, not too fatty nor too crispy, they were perfect. The only downfall of these large oversized pancakes, is there wasn't much bacon. If they loaded it up with more bacon I would have given them 5 stars so next time I would just get bacon on the side and regular buttermilk pancakes, I mean I'm still dreaming about the batter that they used. My hubby's omelette was very tasty but those home fries were seriously some of the best little, perfect and crispy potatoes I've ever had. Coupled with a spicy frenchys sauce on the side, it was perfection.  Like I said, we only went here once, but I wish we went more times since the prices were very reasonable and overall the food was fantastic. Plus, the people working here are very nice so that's always a good way to start the day. Oh and the orange juice, freshly squeezed so a terrific way to get your vitamin c in the morning. When we come back, I will definitely come here more often. Super tasty, just give me more bacon next time!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Surreys has always been great, and then today happened. Started off by having to go inside to order because even though we were the only people there, the waitress took forever. Ordered the chicken and biscuit with potatoes, the dish had all the makings to be spectacular. The potatoes were ice cold and when they arrived and when I sent them back the conveniently came back 45 seconds later fresh out of the microwave. I don't want to continue this rant because once again surreys has always been the place I take guests or even a nice lunch with the girlfriend but for the love of God even the biscuit was Sahara dry. 3 stars  only because of the beautiful weather and the idea behind the dish was thought out.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Our waiter did seem a little off by bringing dirty wine glasses, not chilling the wine prior to bringing it to the table, and wasn't great answering questions. However, our water glasses stayed full and we had a great time. Everyone talked about wanting to go back again. The menu selection was great and had a lot of options. Also we got free dessert for the people with birthdays. I used the yelp check-in to order a free domestic draft beer.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Food was delicious. Only good thing we have to say. Carol said we couldn't hire a personal coordinator because that was her responsibility which she lacked. We asked for the heaters to be out and they were not out , her and her team never put out our macaroons that were to be displayed at each seat as party favors. She said we would have time for photos during cocktail hour then rushed us all out to the street where our photographers had to then improvise, our own photographers said how rude she was it was embarrassing. Then we bought our own number cards for the table with the holders for them to be placed and the workers didn't pack that up so we never received it in the mail. So be honest, as a bride I wish I would have never settled.  It was an extra cost to have coffee be passed with cake so we paid it but the comment was unnecessary, she said something along the lines of good service cost money or something similar I don't recall exactly. And we had a violinist that was playing while I walked down the aisle and he barely started playing before I was rushed to Walk down.  It's our fault because when we first made the appointment she made a comment about if we knew how much they charge . Insinuating she wouldn't waste her time giving us details if we didn't know the ball park price . If I could , I would have never had my wedding here.

"I don't always believe in reviewing places especially when the review is bad, but I only post this review in hopes that the place improves.   I counted down the months, weeks and days until this place opened because I love Devils Den and I couldn't wait for for a restaurant of similar quality to open around the block. Hearing that the brewmaster was a hop-head was just icing on the cake.   Man, was I disappointed when I finally got to experience Barren Hill. I should let you know that I've been here for dinner three times and lunch once since it opened and there were negatives about each of my experiences. Here are some positives first:   * They have a ton of beer--stuff they brew here and guest taps.  *They seem to have great events, but I've never been to one.   * They maintained the character of the General Lafayette.   Now for the cons, which outweigh the positives:   * Happy hour is only for the bar, not the bar area too. This is very frustrating.  * The food is just not there yet. Nothing I've tried in my 4 visits has been remarkable--at least in a good way.  *The staff is not knowledgeable about beer. They had Yards Brawler in the ""Hop Flight,"" which if you've had Brawler (I have) you know it's not hoppy at ALL.  * The customer service is lacking. I ate lunch next to the service stand and didn't enjoy my experience, so when I came for dinner the next time I asked if they could seat my party of 5 somewhere else when they directed us to the table next to the server stand...want to guess their response? ""This is our only table for 5."" But the restaurant was empty. The bar was packed mind you because that is the only place you can get happy hour prices.

"I would never recommend or use AAA again. There was a dispute over some lost paperwork on their part. They billed me an amount as a result of them not having paperwork that showed I had an alarm system in my home. My insurance started in June, the following February they mailed me a letter saying that they didn't have the proper paperwork, which I then gave them a second time. They then billed me for the time they did not have the paperwork despite me giving them the proper papers showing that I had an active alarm system in my home to get the 10% discount. We fought them over this, but eventually gave up and called them to pay. When my wife called they gave her a different total and she even asked why it was different than the first amount they had called in due. The woman on the phone didn't know, but we paid and thought that was the end of it......until we got a letter in the mail in May saying AAA had cancelled the policy on our home effective on the date of the mailed letter. We didn't open the letter right away thinking it was junk mail from our insurance company. Upon finally opening the letter a week later we found our our home had been without insurance for two weeks! This was a random looking letter with nothing important looking about it at all. I called AAA and the two women I spoke to were very rude and condescending to me. They didn't come out and call my wife and me liars, but they said everything else. They said there was a balance on our account and they cancelled us for lack of payment. First, why didn't they let us know in advance? Second, why do it in a random letter? Third, we were on bill-pay....why not take the payment? After some long, heated conversations with a supervisor they finally agreed to listen to ALL the recordings for our account as they record every conversation to their office. When they called back you would have thought I was this woman's boss as her attitude had now changed, I was now a valued customer and she admitted there had been an error made when my wife made the payment. She apologized, and started our insurance back up....which I cancelled several days later when I transferred everything to Allstate. Being with AAA for less than a year was one of the worst business relationships I've ever had. I've never had a place treat me so poorly when they were in the wrong. And I'm terrified of what could have happened should something had happened to my house during the time they dropped my policy. AAA, you now have someone who tells everyone to stay away from you.

"I'm Vietnamese and from CA so I know pho haha. My boyfriend wanted to show me his favorite pho place in his area so we went here for dinner the other night.   It was good! The atmosphere, service, and most importantly, the food were all great. There was a good amount of everything that the pho came with. We ordered the pho chin and pho dac biet. Sometimes places skimp on the meat or extras (bean sprouts, herbs, etc.), but there was plenty with our meal. The broth was tasty and flavorful, what more could you ask for?  The only qualm I have about the place is that there is only one size portion for the pho and it was too big for me! But that's hardly a complaint haha. We also walked through the back door like locals and if you haven't ever been before, I suppose that could be confusing.   Overall, it was a yummy meal and a good experience. I'm so glad to have found a pleasant Vietnamese restaurant that reminds me of home when I'm so far away.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

I came into town for 30 days to help and work the clean-up from the resent mudslides. Three weeks into my stay I had to move locations due to work. When I checked out and left behind an expensive safety jacket and several shirts that were hanging in the closet. But the worst part of my two stay was the service from the front desk. I called the hotel the next day to inquire about the items I left behind and the lady who answered was very indifferent and said I had to wait until the morning because she was busy. She took my number but never called me back. I waited two days and stopped by the hotel in person hoping to receive better customer service but again spoke to a person who couldn't care less. She said that nothing had been turned in and then just stared at me. She didn't offer to take my number or to offer any suggestions.

Even though there was hardly anyone else in the restaurant, our food took a very long time. Our waitress was cold and inattentive.

"The feature of this (microbrewery? brewpub?) very casual restaurant is beer. There  are six drafts and a cooler full of bottles and cans. Our group of four had 18 Watt ($6.50), Breckenridge Porter ($6) and Double Nickle Jetro. Chalk board descriptions of the drafts are  minimal and this is made up for by readily provided samples.   Rybrew is semi-self serve. Orders are placed at a central station, beer is opened or poured before you leave, and food is delivered to you at your seat.   The meal was lunch and the Indian summer weather was perfect for sitting at a sidewalk table. A bonus on Girard is the classic trolley that, hopefully SEPTA will keep running in spite of consultant's recommendation.    Sandwiches ordered by the group were Kansas City ($9.20), Rybread ($10) Santa Fe Panini ($7.90) and Philadelphia ($7.50) I had the Kansas City, a good and sloppy pulled pork and my wife described her crab cake (the Rybread) as excellent. Both sandwiches were, notably, on a brioche. No complaints from the other two eaters.   The bartender/server/order taker/cashier was either poorly trained or overworked. We had to ask to have the table wiped off and the plastic fork bin had to be filled by request.   (Note, prices in this review are from the receipt.

"This place was very unique in design and in what they served. Personally I've never been to a southern cuisine restaurant but it was a great surprise! The service was excellent as well. Very attentive staff and they made sure my drink was always full!  Food: To start off, fresh biscuits with a side of jalapeño jelly are served. I generally don't like jalapeño but it was delicious! The fresh biscuits were hot and fresh too. I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.   For my main, I ordered the Philly cheese steak po'boy with a side of sweet potato fries. The Philly cheese was pretty tasty but was a bit on the messy side. The steak was also a bit tough. Judging from this meal, I would probably order a different po'boy next time. The po'boy was alright but the star of my dish was the sweet potato fries. They put some amazing batter and seasoning on these things to give them that extra crunch and hit of Cajun flavour that I like. I would definitely come back just for those fries. Plus the garlic aioli dipping sauce was the perfect accompaniment.   My boyfriend ordered the seafood jambalaya. I personally don't like too much seafood but he loved it. They gave plenty of seafood and the rice was especially flavourful. It will be ordered again.   For dessert I took home the hand-made key lime pie. It was a little too much crust for me and on the sweet side. Not my favourite.   Overall the fries and service made me give this restaurant 5 stars.

This is really the only thing I come here for...  Their lunch specials are pretty sweet, coming with a drink, entree and salad or soup for only $5 (and change depending on which entree). The entrees are also made to order, very quickly, right in front of your eyes.  I usually get the chicken Yakisoba, basically a Japanese lo mein dish; the noodles are fresh, they use free range chicken and they have really perfected the balance of flavors. Love the salty pickled ginger served alongside.  The house made iced green tea is also a highlight of lunches here.  The salad is standard, but always fresh.

I wish the sitting was a bit better. If you get a small table for two it is too close to other customers and plates will take up all the table space.

"2.5 rounded up to 3   Mixed feelings about this place.  Good Halal food carts have a place very near and dear to my heart, there is a void there aching to be filled here in Wilmington so, although I'd love to rave about this place, I can't.  But, They have POTENTIAL!  The food is mediocre, lacking the explosion of flavor I crave from ethnic cuisine.  The fried chicken was good, 3 stars, the chicken and rice was fresh, juicy, but seemed to be just salted and powdered with a few dry spices which were faintly in the background.  Chicken and rice is served with broccoli, not the cool fresh crisp contrast I'm used to.  I asked for spicy and they threw a few pickled jalapeños into the mix, but it didn't really work.  On the plus side their 'crack sauce' is some of the best I've tasted.  The tandoori chicken had a nice crust on it, but again was lacking in flavor.  The rice tasted like rice, nothing special and a bit rubbery.  They are disorganized, but friendly.  I will go back to sample their other offerings.  I truly hope they are able to recover.

I wasn't expecting it to be sweet but it had a light sweetness to it and was very refreshing. All the drinks were unique and were very tasty.

For example, my sister's friend wanted something spicy with a clear rum and they made her an ""English breakfast"" (I think that's what they called it).

"Can only provide feedback based on my delivery, however, with that said the food was absolutely delicious.  I had ordered the goat curry, tandoori chicken, and plain naan. For being delivery everything was still hot and fresh and really tasty.   The goat curry was really chunky and did not have a lot of bone. The sauce was absolutely fantastic with just the right blend of fresh herbs and spices that provided a good amount of heat but not overbearing.  The tandoori chicken was exceptionally moist and not dry at all. You can tell that this chicken was not sitting around under a warmer waiting to be delivered to some poor soul. The dry spices on the tandoori chicken was not overbearing and just right.  I got two orders of rice so apparently one order of rice comes with each dish. I only ate half of one of the rice and half of the naan. That's a lot of food for one person!

"Delicious food. Great ambiance. Fantastic location. Great price point. Couldn't have been a better end to a FANTASTIC DAY!!!  We happened upon this little find after another nearby restaurant was closed; it couldn't have been a better opportunity to try some place new if we had planned it. When I saw the name, I KNEW we were in for a treat.   Crab cakes... Nachos... Bottomless margarita... Hello, Saints weren't the only winners today!!!  Alex S our server was over the top, rendering great customer service. She made sure our glasses were always filled and that we had plenty to eat... She paid great attention to us, even though we weren't her only customers.  The manager came over and chatted it up with us as well; I didn't get his name, I'll always remember that genuine smile.   The CRAB CAKES were beyond delicious. Light and fluffy, yet loaded with crab meat and seasoned just PERFECTLY!!!   The nachos had ample cheese and other fixings; so much so until I was using my fork to scrap up the rest before I let the plate be removed from the table.   The bottomless margaritas... Ohhhhh so tasty!!!! There was no skimping on the liquor or the margarita mix; it was full on and I ENJOYED it!!!!   Great price point. We had plenty of drinks and great tasting food at a nominal rate for two people.   There's an outdoor patio and a rooftop area available for your dining pleasure. I'll make sure to return she it's cooler and visit the rooftop as the view looks phenomenal.   Street parking is the order for the day.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 5.0
"(Part 2 of a 2-part review; for Part 1, see above)  4TH COURSE: Pavé de Loup, caviar, Petite Nage a L'Orange  Pierre's.  As I understand it, loup or ""wolf"", was in this case actually black sea bass, and a pavé is a square or rectangular portion reminiscent of street paving or brick.  Be that as it may, this was a perfectly cooked and seasoned portion of one of my favorite fish, with a truly lovely sauce.  But it was really the large dollop of ""caviar"" (the suddenly trendy, more affordable paddlefish roe from Alabama, not the real stuff!), providing a dramatic flavor contrast with the mild fish, that really made this dish memorable.  Perhaps my second favorite course.  ~2005 Domaine William Fèvre Chablis Grand Cru Les Clos ~2007 Marcassin Chardonnay Three Sisters Vineyard  5th COURSE: Roasted lamb, beluga lentils, heirloom carrots, asparagus  A dish you would immediately recognize as Chips, acknowledging what seems to be a new trend of lamb belly (pig belly is soooo over, I guess!).  Unfortunately, my belly was a bit tough, although everyone else's seemed to be melt-in-their-mouth.  However, the loin was perfectly medium rare, with a silky rich sauce (IMHO, Chip, having been the Saucier at Le Bec Fin, does sauces better than anyone else in the city).  ~1990 Château Léoville Poyferré (Wine of the Night) ~2004 Pax Syrah Castelli Knight Ranch ~2007 Cayuse Syrah Armada Vineyard  6TH COURSE: Souffle Glace Grand Marnier, blueberry coulis  When I saw Grand Marnier souffle on the menu, I immediately thought of Bibou's, a giant creation that they punch a whole in with a fork and fill with a jigger or two of Grand Marnier (a rather dangerous dessert!).  But this was not that dish, but apparently an old classic from Le Bec Fin, with a frozen soufflé and a delectable berry sauce.  I'm not sure if this was prepared by Chip or Pierre (they both used to work at Le Bec), but since Bibou tweeted a picture of this yesterday, it was probably Pierre's creation.  The best dessert I've had so far this year.  Obviously a fantastic meal.  We had a table for 10 in the back room, which I think is a little quieter than the front.  Service, as always at Blackfish, was stellar, and it was also great to see Hans, our favorite Bibou server, enjoying the dinner along with the rest of us.  Pierre's lovely wife Charlotte also put in an appearance with Eloise, their new baby daughter (see the adorable photo of Pierre and Eloise I posted on the Yelp Bibou page), who is obviously well on her way to being as wonderful a hostess as her mother.  ~1975 Château Climens Sauternes  Who won this ""competition""?  I'm going give the Dish ot the Night to Chip's wonderful quenelles.  But other than that, I'll stick with calling it a draw.  To steal a phrase from a famous Philadelphian (W.C. Fields): On the whole, I'm glad I live in Philadelphia (where we have two such great chefs and restaurants to choose from).  Cilantro!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I have to say the way I was treated at the truck today was really disappointing. The truck was outside of my work a couple of weeks ago (CAC) and I asked about something without tomatoes. (I unfortunately have an allergy. Not exactly something I can help.) The person who helped me (quite friendly) helped to direct me to the items I could eat. I ordered and thoroughly enjoyed what I purchased. Today, I go to the truck and ask if the special has tomato in it. The girl just says, ""Yes"" so short and curt like I'm a BF who's in the doghouse. So, I ask, ""Can I get it without tomatoes?"" She could have said, ""I'm sorry no, but we can maybe do x,y,z."" But no, she proceeds to explain to me all the ingredients and why they have tomato with a tone that sounded like I was the biggest idiot for not knowing that. Again, just looking at me and not even bothering to make any suggestions. I said, ""Ok, what about the braised pork?"" (thinking I could do like last time and just get meat with the slaw, etc. without tomatoes. I still always check just in case.) She obviously realizes I'm not just going to go away so, she says, ""Is this like an allergy or something?"" I said yes. She says, ""Well, everything has tomatoes so I don't want to serve you anything"" and just motions to the next person. Like I'm the asshole who is just wasting her time. There's tomato in cheese and corn tortillas? Or cheese, no meat, slaw and corn tortilla? She didn't even bother to try and assist me. I probably could've pushed it and figured something out but based on her attitude, I didn't want to chance it. She seemed like the kind of person who would slip some tomato in on me just to be a jerk or punish me for even having the AUDACITY to ask.

My girlfriend and I walked to the restaurant hoping to sit outside the weather was great in the mid 60s.  The patio was setup so we requested a seat and we were greeted by an older Italian man who ignored our request and decided to show us to the table he suggested.  We sat for a bit next to a larger party and the server took quite a while before he got our orders for drinks or food even though the large party was already mid course.  He seemed disinterested in a party of two vs a party of ten.    Another table of 4 sat down and he greeted and served them promptly.  I try not to take the racial route but being Asian this isn't always a surprise.  After working in the restaurant business I understand the grind and always tip well because of that grind.  It's sad to see decent places like this with service as bad as it was - I hope others don't feel this way.    Our food was good and the cost also is not expensive but we unfortunately won't return with other places on the hill that have a food just as good with far better service. It seems awful to give a decent restaurant like this three stars but the service was just that terrible of an experience.  If folks didn't use yelp as avidly as we all do I would give this 2 stars which would be the for the food.

"So, we got a Groupon for the Jazz Dinner Cruise. You must call in advanced to make reservations with this Groupon. They request you arrive by 6pm so you can get seated at a table.  We got to choose a table for 2 near the window. It is a formal setting with a buffet. You can dress casually though. Many tourists were boarding just having walked the French Quarter...tennis shoes, t-shirts, ball hats, and shades..no big deal.  The atmosphere was lovely. The boat stayed stationary for about an hour and a half so everyone could eat without too much bouncing around. Live jazz music played as we ate.   Service was excellent. Our server, Rosie was very sweet and knowledgeable. The servers at the buffet were not stingy at all and welcome to second and third helpings. There is also one dessert on a table off to the side.  Ok..now let me get to the food itself. It was a wonderful set up. Everything looked great and was refilled often. However, I can't say everything tasted great.  First up on the buffet table was a ceasar salad. That was fine. Nothing to say about that.  Next was jambalaya. Now this jambalaya was a bit unusual for me. Some people make their jambalaya with tomato paste which is what I experienced here..but the unusual part was that the meats in it were chicken and some sort of beef. It wasnt until I started to eat the rest of meal that I realized that the beef in the jambalaya was probably left over brisket from the last dinner cruise. Anyway, I don't particularly like to eat jambalaya with tomato paste in it so I just picked at the meat.  Then came what I believe to be Cajun chicken pasta. Its pretty good. A little on the bland side but nothing a little salt and pepper can't fix.  Next tray had steamed veggies. What can I say...they were steamed. It didn't seem to have any seasoning whatsoever. And that's ok.  The tray after that was maque choux corn. Don't let the name scare you off. Its just a cream style corn with some Cajun seasoning. Its fine.  So my plate was starting to get full. I bypassed. The red beans and rice and baked chicken. I make that every week so if I miss it, I miss it.   I decided to get to the brisket and rolls. That brisket was juicy and tender...BUT lacked flavor. I still liked it..i still ate it.   Those rolls though. Omg! They were good. So soft and fresh. I didn't even get a chance to hit the corn bread bc I was afraid I would hate it too much bc of the rolls. I know..Im weird. And thats ok.  So I managed to stop eating them dang rolls. And decided to add more loosen my belt... And I hit the red beans and rice and the baked chicken. I can say I had mixed feelings about this last plate. The red beans looked like there was tomato in that too. Instead of tasting like red beans...it tasted like lima beans. It had a gritty texture and the flavor was just a bit off. Not spoiled but off. So, I didn't even finish that.  The baked chicken though was delicious. It was so juicy and seasoned just right. Cooked to perfection.   I forgot to mention that they also served gumbo. Im not really a gumbo eater but for this review, I decided to try it. First off I noticed huge chunks of green onion and tomato. Who puts that in a gumbo? I guess Creole Queen does. It didn't taste bad, though. The flavors were there. Strong file seasoning. It wasnt for me. My fiancee gladly ate my portion up. He liked it very much. So I can't say to take my word on the gumbo. But otherwise, he agreed on everything else with me.  The alcohol. I ordered a big cheif punch (like a rum punch) and he had a sazerac. My drink was yummy but not strong enough to guve me a buzz or even a hiccup. His drink was nothing but whiskey and it was strong.  This version of the sazerac had no absinthe and packed a full punch..nothing smooth about this concoction. He asked them to take it back and ordered a hurricane instead.   The server told us we could walk around for a bit on the boat. Let the food settle and come back for dessert. They start picking up around 830pm. We had about 45 min.  There are about 3 levels/floors on the boat. The dining area is on the bottom floor and only accessed by the passengers who payed for the dinner cruise. The second floor also has a private event room and 2 other areas with bars and live music played in one room (Kings room). This same room has a window view of the paddle wheel up close as it turns.   The upper deck(3rd floor) is more of an open area. Where people can sit outside under shade and watch life pass you by. There is plenty of seating here.   So we finally explored the boat and made room for dessert. White chocolate bread pudding. Nice, moist and warm. If I hadnt been so full, I would have gone for seconds.  You don't have to buy the dinner cruise to enjoy it. It was just something we chose to do bc Groupon. I would ride it just for the relaxing view.

Had the famed Spicy Chicken Sandwich recently and...it's interesting. The sandwich is certainly tasty, but I think the hype is a bit overblown. For starters, I was slightly stunned by the lack of spice on the ""spicy"" chicken sandwich. I didn't realize the only difference between this and the mild version is the sauce (which is not nearly as spicy as Popeyes' BBQ). Once I added BBQ, the sandwich was enhanced but I would eat my own foot if adorned with Popeyes BBQ. Let's be real, with Popeyes' mix of seasoning included in the batter, the sandwich was never going to be bad. I just don't find it all that remarkable.

Their Sips specials were decent - $2 Coors and Yuengling, a couple varieties of wine for $3 and a marg and something else for $4.  They seemed to be out of wine shortly after I arrived at 6:45 (fashionably late)... but I stuck with Yuengling anyway.  The place was nice, I'm intrigued to come back at night sometime.  The crowd was a good-looking after-work crowd, and it wasn't too crowded, especially compared to the packed downstairs at Alfa.

It was close to closing time and no one seemed upset at our timing. If you ever sit down when it's close to closing time people can act bothered. Not the case here. That's one of the main reasons for a 5 star review. Loved our meal and the service. Wife said her salad was the best she has had. Wasn't a bunch of refried beans and iceberg lettuce. Had real green leaf lettuce. Big deal to her.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"It's been a while since the last time I ate at Josephine. The last time I went, it was right when it opened and I had a mediocre meal. This time, I decided to try it out again since it had been so long.   There were parts of the meal that tasted great and some parts not so much. For appetizers, I ordered the frisée salad and the chestnut ravioli with mushrooms. Both had great flavors and it made me excited for the entrees.   When the dishes came, I was less than impressed. I ordered the steak and frites (weary bc last time I ordered the steak it was bloody and tough) and sadly, not much has changed with this dish. Once again, the steak was tough and chewy. The flavor was there but I couldn't get past the texture of the meat.  It tasted like it needed to rest longer before slicing it into odd, uneven size portions. I would definitely suggest not ordering this. Another suggestion would be the scallop dish, although I wanted a pinch more salt on it.   Overall, the service was good, the apps were satisfying but the entrees fell flat to me. I would say our meal was pretty average.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"We checked out this spot after scouting out a few locals for recommendations. I'm not in for the tourist spots. When I travel, I want to do what the Romans (or Philadelphians) do. When we finally tracked down Ishkabibble's, we saw a massive crowd of locals swarming the order window, which looked promising. The line to order was short, but boy was the wait for food service long. And it 90 degree heat, waiting over 30 minutes inside to get your order was taxing.  That said, it was entertaining to hear the banter of the locals and watch the chefs making cheesesteaks on the grill. I was also blown away by the staff who not only stayed cool under pressure (and the heat, my God, the heat!), but also offered glasses of ice water to cool us poor souls melting in anticipation of our sandwiches.  When the sandwich did arrive, I initially burnt my mouth something fierce through a mix of hunger and sheer anticipation. They're freshly cooked (AKA - HAWT). It's about the same size as a footlong sub, and I, a little girl, was able to finish mine with no help. Get your own unless you're only feeling peckish. The meat itself was good, perhaps a bit overcooked - I would have liked to see it a little more tender and moist. I wish I had chosen the whiz over the provolone; despite there being 3 pieces of cheese, there were only a few bites that tasted cheesy. In fact, I found the sandwich so dry I ended up slathering it in ketchup, mustard and hot sauce.    Overall, it was a good sandwich, and after seeing a line around the block at Jim's across the street that looked like it was comprised solely of tourists, I felt like we had gotten the more local/genuine experience. That said, I wouldn't do it again. Or I would but differently (more toppings, whiz) and not on labour day weekend in the sweltering heat.  P.S. There are 2 small bar tops inside where you can eat.

"Checked in early, staff was helpful with my questions, room rate was $109 for an executive king, room size better than traditional king, we had asked not to face the street, had a river view on 12th floor.  Since the 14th floor is haunted (interesting story from our waiter at restaurant) we knew in advance to request a lower floor.  Elevator was not working so we called the front desk to let them know, they did send up repair crews immediately. Non-smoking room, the folks next door were smoking, irritating at best, hotel security did come up as requested.  Pool is nice but bar was closed, view is blocked but still beautiful sunsets.  Carousel bar nice but when you have a $12 cocktail and request food from the bar menu, they state that you have to remove yourself and go to the restaurant, hmm. Print out your boarding pass, that will cost you $7.00, no Wi-Fi.   There is no shuttle to the airport but for $40 for 2 a taxi will take you there, much better than parking a car for $42.00 per day.

"My husband and I are expecting our first baby soon and planned our last 'romantic trip' together before life changes. We both love Bacara and thought 4 days/3 nights here would be a perfectly relaxing way to celebrate this special time. Day 2 of our 4 day Babymoon and doesn't seem to have anything going right. We checked in yesterday around 5pm and immediately noticed a strange smell in our room that seemed to be sulfur/raw sewage. We ignored it (mostly because the bellhop hadn't said anything as he put all our things inside) and thought maybe it would go away. We went for a walk and later to The Bistro for dinner and upon returning to the room, the smell seemed to had gotten worse. I called the front desk to let them know about the smell and alerted them that we may need to move rooms the next morning if the smell didn't dissipate. The thought of packing up everything (we brought a lot of stuff for our 4 day stay!) at 9:30pm and moving to another room was too much for me to consider. We set up a 9am move for the next morning and I drew a bath hoping to alleviate my back aches from the long drive to the resort. Upon getting out of the bath and trying to drain the tub, it was obvious the room had a problem with its plumbing, as the bath wouldn't drain and the smell from the bathroom became so intense, I actually felt severely nauseous! My husband was nearly sick from the stench but can you possibly imagine what it was like for me, being over 7 months pregnant and incredibly sensitive to smells?? I called the front desk and suggested we pack everything back up (not looking forward to this task, as 10pm is typically the time I'm in bed!) and move to a different room that evening. It was so frustrating having our first night disrupted like this, that I really thought the hotel would offer something to make us feel better for the inconvenience of packing and moving rooms so late in the evening. Instead, I was assured that ""engineering would take a look at the room the next day"" (big deal. How does that effect us?) and then offered a cup of tea. Let's just say this didn't exactly meet my expectations of making us feel better for our first 5 hours at the hotel. When the bellhop arrived to move our luggage, he gasped as I opened the door and let the smell out. He even told us he could smell it down the hallway before coming to our room!  Finally settled into a new room, I went to toss the tea bag wrapper (tea being our consolation prize for being subjected to that awful experience) and shocker... No trash can. Our other room had 2 or 3! I asked my husband to do a sweep of the room to be sure I wasn't having 'pregnancy brain.' Yup, no trash can. Called front desk to have it delivered. Didn't end up getting to bed till almost midnight. Not a good start. Today, we spent most of the day away from the hotel and around town. Came home briefly to change and head back to The Bistro for dinner. We went to turn the tv on in the meantime and... Again, shocker... It wouldn't work. Called the front desk (again) and they sent an engineer over to fix it.  So all in all, it's not the experience we were hoping for on this trip. I understand that things go wrong from time to time but I would hope they would have gone above and beyond to make amends for the below average experiences. I guess a cup of hot water and a tea bag is their way of making up for a $500+ room that smells like a dump.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"This cute Thai/Malaysian BYOB delivers above average renditions of most Thai cuisine.  They do accept reservations, but you can usually get a walk-in table without too much of a wait.  Because of the BYOB nature and moderately priced tasty food, it seems to be a popular spot for groups.  When the place is full, it can get a little loud.  The staff is very friendly and the chef (formerly with Penang) often walks around to see how people are enjoying their dishes.  I wish that I could give Aqua 3.5 stars.  It actually would have been 4-5 in the first year they were open, but I have noticed a disappointing decrease in portion size and increase in price.  Keep in mind that this is just relative to the rosy glow of the past; it's not like I now leave there hungry or broke.  The menu, which is now dominated by Thai, used to have more Malaysian selections.  Some of their stand-out dishes include the shrimp puff appetizers, ginger scallion chicken, and kari ayam (a slow cooked chicken in rich spicy sauce).  Their dishes tend to be on the sweet side - to the extent that I find the actual ""sweet"" dishes like mango chicken to be way too sweet.  They also seem to cater to an American standard of spiciness such that I do not find their ""spicy"" labeled dishes to be particularly so.  Fortunately, they are happy to kick up the heat a little if you ask.  I go to Aqua pretty often, and have never regretted a trip there.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Brings drinks, no straws, no offer of straws . I end up getting it myself as opppsed to asking server for them as THAT table had ordered wine & it was somehow complicated. Food surprisingly came timely , on plastic dishware. Had to ask for silverware. The food was ok, not fabulous, but didn't suck. What DID suck was the portions size! The rice & bean sides were pretty tiny portions. As others mentioned there's pin up pics on the walls, which I personally didn't mind but I could understand how people with small children might not appreciate that.

"Overall our stay wasn't horrible but it wasn't great. We stayed 3 nights. The first impression was great, we arrived very early and they let us check in which was an absolute blessing. Once we arrived in the room we went to take a nap because we had been traveling since 3 am and realized we had no remote... went downstairs and asked for one they said no problem we will send someone up! 3 hours later still no remote... asked again and left to go to dinner came back several hours later and again.. no remote. We went down again and said hey what's going on and someone brought us a remote within the next 10 min. Front desk staff was very nice and I'm not sure what the mix up was but oh well nothing to lose our minds over. Then after the first night we noticed that around 3 am the room would get UNBAREABLY HOT and then would begin to cool down around 6-7am (the thermostat said 87 degrees and would not allow me to change it) this caused for very poor sleep during our stay. Again not the worst hotel but not the best. For the location and the price i guess we got what we paid for.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 3.0

It appears the theater is going through some remodeling in the ticket booth area. Therefore the line for tickets and popcorn was pretty backed up. The staff however was working hard to keep up with the long lines. I felt they were making a sincere effort for the amount of staff that was available.   The theater did have popcorn noticeably on the floor throughout the lobby area. It's the little things like this that can make a theater appear messy or not.   The women's bathroom I struggled to find any soap. After trying out several dispensers I finally found one. But then the hand blow dryer near the door was not working.   The seats are super comfortable and I like they are pretty silent as they recline. The popcorn at this theater is AMAZING. Usually when I get popcorn from a theater I may eat some but not more than 3/4. This popcorn was so good I ate most of the bag!   The sound quality seemed fine and the screen was a nice size.

"If I could have selected 0 stars I would have this is my family's second experience with this dental facility and each time it has been a nightmare. My husband was seen there today he was in excruciating pain, he did not have an infection and his tooth could have been extracted but instead they decide to give him a $ 7,010.00 treatment plan and he could not even have the root canal till the 16th. Now mind you his insurance covers almost everything, so his responsibility is only $ 913.20. What really ticks me off is that our appointment is on the 16th but we have to pay to reserve the slot in advance are you freaking kidding me? So what is most important to Aspen dental is to allow the patient to be in unbearable pain for a week because a root canal makes them more money than an extraction...... wow my next step is to report this to our insurance company because this is unacceptable treatment of a retired law enforcement officer and 9/11 first responder.

The selection of pizza is good plus if you want something special, all you have to do is just ask them. Which is a plus. They offer a salad bar and dessert bar as well. Plus Pasta, chicken, soups, and some other food items.  They have games for all ages. A toddler area with games and a play area.  Roller coaster, bumper cars, and raceway.

"So, I'm discriminating but not a prick and I rarely give out 5 stars because there is rarely perfection. I also like my food seasoned aggressively. In short this is a can't miss for price + food quality + service + ambiance. A lot of the restaurants in Seminole Heights come across as a bit ""trendy snobby"", not this place. It's unpretentious and comfortable. The menu didn't have a dish I wouldn't try.  We started with the cobia collar and the scallop crudot. Our favorite was the cobia but the scallop dish was really good. How can you go wrong with a fried collar? The pickled turnip and radish were nice and nouc man rounded out the dish. The spicy greens and black sesame seeds make the scallop dish. We moved on to the boar chop and the braised shank. Both dishes were very good. I will say that the star of both wasn't the proteins (although they were well done). I've always said you can tell the best restaurants by what they pair with the proteins and the care taken in preparation. These were spot on, damn delicious, and I wouldn't change a thing. We had a dessert and it rounded out the meal.  We left full but comfortable. I thought the portion sizes were perfect and priced well, especially given the quality. One of the things I really hate is leaving with a ""doggie bag"", leaving food on the plate, or being full before the main arrives. I completely disagree with reviews that the portions are too small or too expensive.   For my palate, I would have tweaked a few things - but we were more than satisfied by the experience.

"0 stars if possible.  Absolute worst owner, service and worst dining experience ever.  Period.  They are not only pretentious, but their food isn't even unique enough to merit the attitude.  While just ""good"" taste wise, they are doing nothing unique, New American Bistro is a dime a dozen, and their lack of even the minimal care and concern for their diners experience makes them a disgrace to the industry.  Their piss poor attitude (evident by the lack of apology and the chef/owner himself telling us off for relaying our negative experience) coupled with their inability to effectively serve 40 people seated by their own reservation schedule is an impressive failure, to say the least.  If you're not ready to play the big boys game, on a Saturday night, you should do a better seating schedule, learn what the word hospitality means, learn how to serve multiple people efficiently or don't throw your hat in the ring AT ALL.  Getting ""slammed"" when all your tables aren't full and your restaurant is small with a 3 person line and your server doesn't  stop by the table ONCE during the 40 minute ticket time for entrees is disgraceful and a poor excuse for such bad treatment (especially when the server, Pete or Paul?, can be seen conversing for 10 minutes at the table NEXT to you).  However, when mistakes happen, as they will, you don't even know how to apologize appropriately. A simple ""my apologies for your experience"" could have rectified the whole evening.  Somehow that is beneath them and the Chef/owner would rather say ""thanks for the attitude, ladies"". You sir picked your profession, you chose to go into the hospitality industry, stop being pretentious and behaving like those choices did the general public a favor and that we (who pay your $50 per person avg) owe you anything.  I've been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years, and bravo Chef, you win for having been the biggest disappointment in those entire 20 plus years.  The art of hospitality and the industry itself is lost in your establishment. There's one honor you do deserve.    Response to ""Chef"" :  Oh my gosh, thank you ""Chef"".  You validated my negative review! You are the reason chefs get the egotistical stereotype.  You mentioning my call only makes it better. It's true. I'm glad you heard it.    Not once did you apologize. But I like how you mention it was 5 ladies, acting like we were attacking you and you couldn't get in a word edgewise.  It was me, restaurant business for over 20 years as previously stated, a surgical oncologist, an internal medicine doctor, a cardiologist, and my daughter.  Only I and my sister, the surgical oncologist, spoke to you in a very controlled and polite manner until you showed complete lack of care or concern for the way we were treated at your place of business. Obviously, you should have worked at a real restaurant to learn how to run one, before owning one.  You paid for the title of ""Chef"", vs the ones who earn it through years of hard work.    You may indeed work hard.  But you do not do it to guarantee an exceptional overall experience of you could care less about our experience and write it off as simply as you have.  I have been in the business and have been married to a real Chef long enough to know how hard the restaurant industry is.  But there are many restaurants who pull it together, exquisite cuisine, presentation, service and overall experience that go without the recognition that they deserve.  Please don't act like you are on the same level as they are. You should be able to pull off an amazing experience for the prices and recognition you are demanding.  All you offer are excuses.   Thank you for reaffirming my thoughts and showing the yelp community just how egotistical you are.    Love, Karen",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I just checked out this morning and want to leave my review while its fresh.  1. When I first saw this place I wanted to love it. The rooms double balcony doors are phenomenal. The location is great. I stayed in room 10 (floor above check in)  The cons are  1. There's construction currently across the street that starts at 7am so my idea of a peaceful morning on the balcony was shot. Not in their control just make a note.  2. The hotel was pre paid by my company and when I got there I left a card for incidentals. However, they didn't actually register my card in any way. They instead ran it for an amount of $10 a day for a resort charge. Which I would have thought would be included in the original charge so I didn't love that.  3.  I can't see how this place is ADA complaint. Lots of stairs 2-3 in a bunch of places and getting your luggage in and out (alone) was annoying.  4.  There was no AC in the room. 2 fans and a great breeze if you left the doors open all night.  But it was October. In the summer I imagine this isn't sufficient.  5. They told me to park in the hotel lot. Literally 8 spots. Then they told me to park on the street behind them which I did. A $50 ticket later (parking during street sweeping) I was mad as hell nobody at the hotel would mention that when telling me to park there.  6. The bed was super extra firm. I like firm and it was even too firm for me.

"I have been to other Texas de Brazil locations and they vary in selection and overall experience so I was a little hesitant to make a reservation here to celebrate my parents' birthday (yeah both, they are 4 days apart, lucky me!) but this restaurant is one of the best Brazilian steakhouse experiences I have ever had. Aside from the regular standards; great quality food on the amazing salad bar, large selection of tempting meats served, etc. this establishment sets itself apart from all the rest with the star quality waitstaff they have. Their employees, from the hostess to the gauchos were outstanding from the moment we walked in the door to the time they rolled us out of there (with dessert!) We arrived early for our reservation so we patiently waited in the comfortable and convenient patio area, had a couple drinks which were conveniently added to our bill, which we appreciated versus paying multiple times. We were seated and explained the procedure of the restaurant and then the fun began. Besides the delectable meal, all the friendly gauchos and our accommodating waitstaff really enhanced the whole experience as they tended to our every need and made us feel welcome and special. It was definitely a busy night and we could understand getting lost in the mix, but there was hardly a misstep throughout the night.

We ordered the filet, (medium -one each of course), creamed spinach, mashed potatoes and bourbon maple bacon- all shareable dishes. To start, we split a wedge salad which I peppered to within an inch of its life! I love pepper   Drinks included my two glasses of red wine, while he drank first a mule then a double Basil Haden.

"I'm gonna say it up front - as someone who grew up in NJ (southern! outside of Philly! Exit 4!), I've been on the lookout for years for pizza here that is even vaguely close to what I would get at home. This, along with Grimaldi's (although a different kind of East Coast style), comes pretty dang close - huzzah!    The pizza was spot on - it looked exactly what I would get at my favorite Cherry Hill, NJ mobster-run pizza parlor.  Nice thin slice, huge (required for the requisite folding over of said slice), perfect amount of cheese ooze and tomato sauce. Sigh. I feel like I'm home.  The lasagna meal for under $12 was pretty filling since it came with a small salad, 2 of the legendary garlic knots, and a large aluminum pan that housed a generous slab of lasagna. Next time I'll ask for just a wee bit less sauce to bring the sodium down, but it hit the spot. Better yet, I'll just shut up and just scrape off a bit of the sauce - it'll keep it moist.  It takes a bit of time to get the order in, so PRO-TIP: Order ahead and pick up or eat here if you are time sensitive.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I don't typically choose Italian restaurants when I go out and I definitely don't go out to Brentwood very often.  But I had a work dinner to attend and Amerigo was the place.  Man, I should be frequenting this place!  First off, the atmosphere is very nice - dark, upscale but not too fancy pants.  They have private rooms at this one so you can reserve the room for your group dining needs.  On to the food.  The menu is extensive and includes many Italian classics and other items that aren't so you are sure to find something to please everyone.  For appetizers I tried... Cheese fritters - blended cheeses with tomato sauce and honey mustard fried into a ball.  Like an upgraded cheese stick but in ball form.  I love fried balls!  These were amazingly good. Artichoke cheese dip - This dip was some of the best artichoke dip anywhere. I could have had this as my entree. Calamari - good, standard Bruschetta - good, standard  On to the entree.  I got the ham hock osso bucco served with Parmesan polenta and seasonal greens which turned out to be turnip greens (or similar).  DAYUM people, this is the entree.  The ham was melt in your mouth good and naturally the bones were there for you to dig out the marrow if you want.  The polenta was also excellent.  And I freakin' love greens.  I want this over and over again.  We also shared a dessert.  Get the pecan butter crunch cake with ice cream and apple cinnamon glaze.  OH MY GAWWWD.  Rich, buttery, sugary, delicious.  Paula Deen would be proud because I think a vat of butter went into this.  It was the type of dessert that you want to devour even though you have no room for any more food.  Thank goodness we were sharing because I would have forced myself to eat it all otherwise.  AH-MAZ-ING.  Honestly, I should have given Amerigo a chance before now because I was thoroughly impressed.

"This review is specifically for Kelly and her lovely co-worker this week in THE SALON...I called last minute to get in for a root color, I live out of town, was in for vacation and couldn't take the gray anymore. They were able to take me at the time I asked for and worked as a team to make it happen. Kelly was easy to talk to, talented, and I appreciated her laid back but professional demeanor. Not pushy at all, and listened to everything I said and delivered what I asked for. My gray is hard to cover and she got it PERFECT. I don't know the other stylist who was working that day but she helped out by giving me the BEST shampoo I ever received. A huge thank you to these ladies, definitely recommend them.

When we walked in, no one was there to greet us. Several staff members walked past and smiled, but didn't offer to help. My husband, having never been here before asked me if we had accidentally come in the back door. It was an uncomfortable length of time before the greeter appeared and seated us.  We sat on the patio - no misters and the fans were off. It was late July in Tucson. Eek.  There were four of us and three of us got our plates. The fourth came out a minute or so later without explanation. We all enjoyed our meals, but $15 for a sandwich and a potato chips seems a little pricey.

"I have always enjoyed coming here since I was a little girl. I've had my bridal shower and baby shower hosted here and consider myself a loyal customer but tonight was rouggghhhhhhhh. I didn't think I would need a reservation on a Tuesday but apparently it was ""Christmas party"" night.  That's fine- I look past that and understand staff are busier during holidays.   I arrived first and sat at my table waiting for my family for a good 15 minutes. In that time- not a drink order or even a menu drop off or really any acknowledgment. I just sat there. Fine. My family arrived and it was a few more people than expected but they had a lot of seating so it wasn't a problem. My whole thing here is that if you already have 2-3 Christmas party's going on- you need more than 3 waiters total. It just ain't gonna work out having each waiter take on 20 person tables plus regular walk in customers. Appetizers took over an hour to come out. We were all joking that it was going to be 9pm before we got entrees and it was close to it. It was kinda painful. My cousins pork chop for $24 was the tiniest pork chop we ever saw. I would think you get atleast 2 of them. Veal was a small portion as well. think I'll check out the new steakhouse down the street next time.

The guy was hilarious and equally we ALL LOVED HIM!  (He's on this season of the Amazing Race!!!  Check your boy out)  He was so friendly and his wine selection was SPEC-TAC-ULAR!!!!

"This place is just getting going. The layout and feel is definitely a hipster style feel to a noodle restaurant:steel, reclaimed Chop Suey sign covered in glass in the center of a community table. The location is in the heart of funk district and I'm sure will take off.  We sampled a couple of items. First a base Ramen bowl with some pork, bacon, bamboo, fried egg and little extra heat. Having never been here before and they are just getting things rolling I opted for the base level heat. It does seam a bit scrugish  to up charge for adding so heat to the dish, but it's not make or break money.   The second item we tried base don the few reviews already here, the wonton and kimchi chorizo nachos. Well the flavored are solid, but we ended up leaving half of it. It was drowning in the sauces, while tasty, just buried the rest of the plate. Maybe put it on the side.   The cider my wife got a good size schooner of cider, but I'd say my Old Fashion was on the small side of things or least felt that way.   What blew my mind is the restrooms! Holy crap they were disgusting!!! You are dropping $50 on meal easy and they are a step below a public bathroom at the beach. They were not clean, they smelled and just looked horrendous.

Many, many years ago I had them pierced but due to an accident and a major surgery I had to remove them all. By today's standards they were simple piercings, but they where part of me for a very long time prior to this surgery.  Well today, yesterday, I started the process Josh evaluated my pre-existing piercings and determined it would be better to have new ones. He laid out the next piercings for 6 weeks from now, which coincides with me going back for a follow up, which they request for all piercings.   I also liked the fact that he would help me figure out best placement for future piercings based on the jewelry and help me create a stunning look. It was a lot of fun and it went by quickly.

"The name of this restaurant suits it well.  I was not at all impressed, and was actually disappointed.  With 7:30 tickets to the Playhouse on Saturday, my wife and I arrived at the saloon at 5:45, and we were seated at 6:10, which was actually surprising for a busy Saturday that we were seated that quickly.  My wife and I then ordered immediately, as we had already looked at the menu before we arrived.  The order was two Bacon Gouda burgers (which sounded amazing), cooked medium, with fries as the side.  After waiting over an hour, with no food, my wife and I had to leave, in order to walk over to the Playhouse, to make the musical that we had already purchased tickets for, on time.  During this time, we had not been told of any delays by our server, and it was even impossible to get our server's attention, as she seemed to only worry about her large tables.    The restaurant was understandably extremely busy, but this should be expected at such a high profile area such as Westport Plaza on a Saturday night, and a restaurant should be prepared these situations.    I would personally think, that with multiple events happening at the Playhouse and Funny Bone (plus elsewhere at the Plaza), any out of normal delays in the kitchen, should be brought to the attention of patrons as they are seated, or even when they put their names on the wait list.  This suggests to me, as a first time patron, that delays are normal for Saturday evenings.  Looking at the menu, the food sounded amazing, and I which that I had the chance to have tasted the food; however, if I have tickets for any event at Westport, I do not foresee myself patronizing this restaurant again, especially with much other options to choose from for dinner.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 1.0

"Excellent lighting, the menu changes frequently to make use of fresh ingredients, and the wine list is carefuly chosen.  I had a delicious argentinian wine from mendoza.  the burgers my friends had were perfect, according to them, and the tempeh chili another person had was also great.  my snapper atop cauliflower with a lobster bisque sauce and asparagus citrus salad was really perfectly cooked and I ate every bite.  The bisque on the plate could have been hotter to stay warm throughout the eating process as it cooled down a little quicker that the rest of the food while I was eating.  the dessert menu looked inspired for the most part, with a few interesting additions to some old standbys like creme brulee, although no one ordered any.  finally, the service was quick, attentive, polite. the waiter was from scotland and he made sure to check in about the food but didnt make himself a nuisance, and was attentive about water and alcohol orders. definitely try it out.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"My husband and I spent Thanksgiving weekend at his childhood home in Montecito, and his dad treated us to breakfast at Bree'osh, a new spot on Coast Village Road. We went at around 10AM on the Sunday of a weekend that saw Santa Barbara pretty empty, but it was doing good business even then. I'm not particularly into bakery food, and I almost tagged along without getting anything. But curiosity got the better of me, and I ended up having a stellar brioche breakfast.  It was a cute place, despite the awful name, small and cozy with a casually expensive Montecito vibe. There was a French couple running the show, and they were nice and kept things moving. We got a table on the little sidewalk patio (we had our dog with us, but I think the seating is mostly outside anyway), and that was pleasant.  The menu consisted of a variety of brioches and brioche sandwiches, with options for brioche-free salads (though obviously, this place was not designed with carb-free eaters in mind). My husband and father-in-law both got brioches--plain, raisin, and almond--while I opted for a sandwich. The brioche was truly exceptional, easily good enough to stand as the tentpole of an entire business. It was fluffy, light, and buttery, and it seemed to come more or less fresh baked. The almond brioche was a great pastry, studded with slivered almonds and spread with a sweet almond paste. I still preferred my brioche savory--I got a sandwich with artichoke heart, sundried tomato, goat cheese, and black olive on sundried tomato thyme brioche. It was delicious, packed full of flavor and delicate textures. Every element brought something to the table, and even though there was a lot going on, the brioche shone through and bound it all together. The sandwich came with a little side salad of wild arugula and parmesan, lightly dressed. It was the kind of salad I tend to ignore, but I ate every last leaf. This place just doesn't mess around.  I tend to skip breakfast most days, even when my husband goes out to grab a croissant or a scone. If Bree'osh were our corner bakery, I might change my habits. I'll definitely remember that brioche sandwich the next time we're in Montecito.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"So you're in the college town of West Chester, see the name and think; just another college bar.  That would be a MISTAKE!  They bill themselves as a gastropub and the look, feel, and taste of the place is exactly that!   The ATMOSPHERE is pure pub and was exactly what I expected.  Lots of dark wood and subdued lighting.  There are plenty of TVs, a jukebox and multiple bars.  So they've nailed the classic pub model but I didn't experience anything unique.    ADULT LIBATIONS were also as expected.  There is a very large beer list with solid variety, a very nice whiskey list, and some specialty cocktails.  Once again it was exactly what I expected to find in a classic gastropub and once again nothing particularly unique. I enjoyed a couple of glasses of an excellent IPA at a fair price.  So what about the FOOD?  If you stripped the menu of identifying info and just showed me the dishes I'd say ""oh, it's a gastropub.""  Are you sensing a theme here?  I ordered House Made Corn Hush Puppies with Herbed Creme Fraiche Drizzle for $6.  They were very good but by now I expected that.  There are plenty of burgers and salads on the menu and everything has that gastro twist.   CUSTOMER SERVICE was just ok.  I was in just after they opened and it felt like they were still prepping for their day.  Everyone seemed a little distracted.  I've visited many, many gastropubs across the county and these folks are a textbook example of this market niche.   I'd be pleased to visit again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
This is me and my wife's favorite restaurant. The prices are ridiculously low. But even if they weren't low I've paid 3 times this much for sushi and it's no where near as good as the sushi here. And if your husband or wife doesn't do sushi get the steak and scallop hibachi. When you see how much you pay for the deliciousness on your plate your mind will be blown. You might pass out. And if you don't you'll pass out when you bite into the delicious perfectly cooked scallop.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"First timer and I have to say I'm not overly impressed. Mild Saturday afternoon and it was half filled. The food definitely was worth ever star I gave it. The brisket was terrific and the sausages were as well. Mac n cheese was good. Collard greens sleeve alright but nothing to write home about.  My biggest qualm was the service. Stood @ the front a few minutes before someone was able to seat us. Though there were seats available downstairs, they initially tried to stick us upstairs in a back room. Would have been nice to be asked prior to assuming we wanted an intimate ""brunch"" instead of trying to sit us there. We decided to sit at the bar instead.  Bartender did his best but wasn't the most observant. I could go on but I think this is enough. When I go to a restaurant I want good service as good food is irrelevant without good service. Hope the service can improve as I want to like it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Like Lucas, we additionally had an unresolved issue with this company. We purchased a groupon on February 20th, 2014 for the show on March 7th, 2014 at 7:00 at the Old Spaghetti Factory. However, quickly after doing so, my husband informed me had purchased tickets for a concert for me that same evening. Our friends purchased the tickets from us and we contacted the company on February 26th, 2014 to change the reservation names free of charge as outlined in their disclaimer. While doing so, the representative confirmed all the information and answered all my questions regarding the menu, attire, etc. As my husband and I sat down for our concert I received multiple text messages from our friends that there was no Murder Mystery Show taking place that evening. Them, along with other couples dressed in theme to participate, were turned away by the restaurant. I quickly called and spoke with the manager of OSF and was informed that the MMC regularly held shows there and their system was that the MMC would provide the restaurant with a list of dates they would like to host shows and the OSF would approve said dates. However, this particular evening was never approved as the restaurant had been closed for two and a half weeks for renovations and that evening was their grand re-opening. They stated the next available date they signed off with the MMC was Sunday March 9th, 2014. Our friends, who were celebrating their anniversary, left and made the one hour drive back to their home as they did not reside in Nashville. Like Lucas, I left messages with no return call. It wasn't until I got a hold of someone via Facebook that I spoke with a rep with the MMC. They informed I would need to obtain a refund through Groupon and made no effort to make it up to us or our friends when I pointed out that the mistake lied with them. We received a bare minimal apology when I mentioned it would behoove them to provide our friends (not us!!) with complimentary tickets that read, ""I do apologize detective. It is first come, first available and you can always give us a call to confirm the available dates and times. Our number is 1(888) 643-2583."" I explained we did confirmed the dates when we changed the reservation names. I have yet to receive an additional response.

"A cool and chill sports-restaurant. But unlike (for the most part) The Press Box, Hooters, Wing House, etc. this place is actually classy and you can bring a non-sports fan here and not have them complain. When I say 'for the most part' the girls here are attractive and wearing short-shorts. I'm not complaining but others might - just be prepared. But the girls aren't dressed like the ladies at Hooters/Wing House/Mugs N' Jugs/etc. which is sort of tasteless and offensive to themselves and others.    Mainly this review is to give a huge recommendation for Brick House's the Kobe. One of the best burgers in the Tampa Bay area. It is so tasty, juicy and good - that I have to highly recommend it. It also comes with this incredibly delicious aioli sauce that goes perfect with the burger. A very different and elegant burger that you wouldn't expect at a sports-restaurant. I've now had it twice and both times it had me saying ""this is one of the best burgers I have ever had"". And trust me; I have had my fair share of burgers from lots of different places. Can't wait to have it again.   Their other food items are good. A pretty good beer and mixed-drink menu/selection. Lots of flat screen TVs with plenty of sports on. Good place, good location, and good scenery. And again; get the Kobe burger; your mouth and stomach will thank you.  UPDATE (2/19/14) - The Kobe Burger no longer comes with the aioli sauce anymore - boo. I ate at the Brick this past Friday night and the burger itself wasn't as good and didn't come with the aioli sauce; thus the Kobe is not as good as it used to be. I asked our waitress about the missing aioli sauce and she had no clue what I was talking about - which made it seem that they got rid of it a long time ago",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"As with other Double Tree Suites, you get a nice sized room with a separate living area and wet bar. The hotel is not the newest, but it is clean and overall fairly reasonable. I was very pleased with the central location (very close to the airport too), as you are less than 30 min from just about anywhere in the Tampa area. That being said, this place is on the water, but you definitely can get better views as you're tucked into the furthest NE corner of Tampa Bay. Unfortunately there isn't a ton around the area within walking distance (other than Whiskey Joe's which isn't a personal favorite). I didn't dine at the on site restaurant but they seemed fairly full each day I was here. Overall, the customer service was great and all staff members were friendly and attentive.

After visiting my 95 year old Aunt there each month over the past 3.5 years I find that there is no accountability at this place for their errors, omissions and poor judgement.  I have a long list of complaints that have only been addressed in part by a previous Administrator who is no longer there.  Little to no turnover of the nursing staff but a constant turnover in administration.  There is very little oversight, quality review or quality control.  No one ever takes responsibility for their actions at Valle Verde.  It's sort of like listening to a Jockey tell the trainer of a race horse who finishes 4th on a 1-9 shot what he didn't do wrong.  In other words they come up with every excuse under the sun as to what went wrong but never take any blame.

"Have you ever gotten so far behind in reviews that you've started forgetting where you've been? No? Well I'm old and senile so let me have this one.  The first time we tried to come here, the music was so loud that we didn't make it into the door. I mean it was wall rattlingly loud. We closed the door and left; didn't even make it inside.  But a few people kept telling me I HAD to try it as it was authentic and worth the noise.  So finally, we tried it.  I can't remember who told me I HAD to go back, but to that person, THANK YOU. Because this was one of the best experiences with Mexican food I've had since living in New Mexico, 30 years ago. Even in California and Texas, I've not had better.  It's a bare-bones place with tables spread out comfortable and a few booths. They do speak English a bit but if you can possibly speak to them in Spanish, it makes them very happy and service improves dramatically (Even if you are bad but ask for help, they LOVE that). Our waitress had fun with us as we ordered and was very accommodating.   Do NOT expect the food to come out fast. I believe they have a very understaffed kitchen but be patient...the food is worth it.   The Girly ordered the chimichanga (She'd give it a 3.5 because it had beans and rice in it and she's used to them just being meat).  Noticing the meats offered, I took a chance on the tacos. One Chiva, one Lengua, one chorizo, and one cabeza.  All were awesome.  The Chiva (Goat) was tender and juicy, the Lengua (Tongue) was tender and tasted like fine steak, the chorizo (Sausage) was spicy but not too oily and the cabeza (Head) was so good that the Girly ate half of mine before learning what it was made from. It was so good that after I told her what it was, she decided it was still good enough to order again. It was so good, I ordered another one and she ate HALF of that one too. Dang greedy Girly.   One of the only downsides is that they do not have unsweetened tea and water is bottled and you are charged for it.  Other than that and the slow kitchen turn around, I have nothing bad to say at all.  P.S. the green salsa is awesome.

"Very disappointed how I was treated with my service dog upon arrival.  Three people behind the counter were pointing at Lana in her dog stroller, and no one was acknowledging me.  I had to speak up and ask what is the problem for them to question if she was indeed a service animal.  She very clearly was well behaved, and had her service vest on.  I pointed out the vest, and again needed to ask what was the problem.  I was informed that people try passing off their dog as a service animal, and an employee was bit the day before.  I stated that they should know if an animal is a trained service animal, and I didn't appreciate being questioned or categorized as such.   I should have left, but decided to stay because I was told the food was great.  The entire time I was there, I felt uncomfortable and the food was no where as good as stated.  My vegy sandwich had little to no vegys in it - it was like eating a bread sandwich.  Portions were small, and not worth the money.  I wanted to support local establishments who are struggling with covid, but after my encounter, will not be going back tomorrow or in the future.

"I had dinner for the first time in many years at Capn Cats in Thorofare Saturday night.  I had been craving seafood so a friend and I decided  to go.  I ordered the fried shrimp platter and a cup of the lobster bisque.  The bisque was ok...extremely thick and it was a generous portion and quite filling.  The platter was a different story.  The shrimp had no flavor at all...they just tasted like fried batter, well done at that.  The French fries were crispy which I like, but they had a burnt flavor from what I don't know....a friend suggested they may have burnt the oil they were fried it.  I didn't eat that many of them.  The cole slaw was almost gel like in a covered cup that was too mayonaisey and not good at all.  I will say our waitress was great but that's where I draw the line.  I wont be going back.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 2.0

"Studio Movie Grill is a fun movie experience- and as long as it is the only theater around with MoviePass E-Ticketing it is a winner in my book.   If you have the movie pass you can book your seat from the app at your house hours before arriving at the theater (as early as midnight), this helps ensure that you can get a great seat for a popular movie.    It is located in the Seminole City Center - a nice shopping center with lots of shopping and some chain stores you can't find anywhere else in the area, and many you can.  Currently, everything is really new and has a nice feel and that Florida planned community look.   The movie theater is nice, well designed, with neon lights and dark halls guiding you to your theater.  Once you get to your comfortable seat, you can push out your foot rest, but you can't really recline your seat back (it is amazing what we think is normal for theaters now).  It has a tray that will sit above your lap and allow you to rest your food and drinks.  There is a button you can hit that will alert the staff that you want more service.   This is where the experience becomes tricky.  It is novel and mildly distracting to have wait staff coming in and out of the theater to serve people as needed drinks and food.   I've been to this theater several times and have had mixed experiences with the service. One visit, my drink oder came out after a reminder after my food came out- over 30 minutes into the movie.  That visit I had Mac and cheese (which was okay) and cheesy fries (consistently good and recommended - I sub tomatoes for the bacon, but my friends say the bacon is tasty too).  I ordered a second drink later in the movie- and it also took a lengthly time.  I checked on it- and in the end they brought me two.  I gave the second to my friend. My friend's first drink had also taken a really long time to come out.  When the check came at the end of the movie they hadn't billed me for the second drink, and taken my friend's drink off of his bill.  So he drank for free - and I purchased two drinks plus the food. it isn't a big complaint- just the way it worked out.   The food isn't bad- it is consistent with any chain restaurant like a chili's or Applebee's.  The pricing isn't what you expect from a movie theater either.  It is very reasonable.  The staff are all really friendly, and seem to prioritize service and politeness.   It is still a fairly new theater- and I am sure it will continue to improve as its open longer and finds it groove.  I easily recommend this theater.",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 4.0

"We wanted to check Firebird's out every since it opened. I have to tell you, the decor is quite nice and the service is good. However, while eating the complimentary bread, our table was consumed by fruit flies. By chance a manager was walking the floor and we were able to get her attention. We quietly explained the situation and asked to move. She stated that she was aware of the issue and would move us but that didn't help.  Now, the food. We started with the smoked chicken wings. They were very good but could have used a little more kick. My girl had the French Dip which was tender prime rib piled nicely. She enjoyed the sandwich but found the au jus to have a very sweet taste. I had the Firebird Durango burger which was cooked to perfection and had good but for $12.50 I expected a little more.

"I went to see a dermatologist a year ago about my psoriasis and they told me it would be 3 months before I could get an appointment. I said that was fine and waited the 3 months. When I was finally at the appointment I saw the doctor for a total of five minutes and all he did was confirm that I had psoriasis (thanks) and then said I'd have to have blood work and a tb test and then left the room. He didn't tell me what kind of blood work I needed or where to go and he didn't talk to me about any kind of medication. And my copay ended up being 80 dollars. Needless to say I was pretty dejected and put off going back to a dermatologist. Then recently my sister, who works at a medical office, told me about Dr. George. She said she moved to a location close by and specialized in psoriasis! So I called to set up an appointment, fully expecting to wait 3 months again, the receptionist asked if I had time the NEXT DAY! So I went in for my appt and I saw Dr. George's associate who was an absolute doll, she told me what kind of labs I needed, where I could go to get them, she told me what medication she felt would be best for me and wanted to get me started on it immediately. So I went and got my labs done at the place she suggested and within a few days I was approved for my medicine. And I didn't have a copay!

At $24.99 (not including drinks) it's a bit pricey, but you get a ton of great food for the price - and you're essentially getting two meals.

Between their omelet and carving stations, biscuits and gravy, and dessert spread, I made sure to get my money's worth.

First, when you customers are very likely to be English speaking..it might be helpful if ALL of the waitstaff could actually understand the language.  I am not asking for perfect English...but, having to repeat things 4 times and still getting the order wrong is beyond frustrating.   Next, food that comes out less than hot is never okay.   Rubbery shrimp....entrees drowning in sauce despite ordering it with very light sauce(in fact, one of the entrees arrived with white sauce because of the language issue...you know, instead of light on the sauce).

Cuisine is upscale bar food, good to excellent quality for the price, often using local ingredients. The only downside I can come up with is that, since there aren't many TVs, it can be hard if you want to watch a specific game on a busy night.

"Cheap, cheap, cheap! And CUTE and not slutty like Forever 21.   I went in today en route to Yogurtland after Pinkberry was closed due to a water pipe explosion.    I went to the girl at the desk and said that I loved this store but did not shop here for one reason and one reason only: OBNOXIOUS club music no one over 21 with an iota of musical taste who is less than three sheets the wind could endure for over 28 seconds.   Why do the people at Forever 21 and H and M--which cater to young people or women with no money--assume lack of funds corresponds to poor musical taste?   The girl working there today is young, the demographic of EOS. This is our main nightclub in town and while I do know the owner through my boyfriend and his ex-wife and would not therefore review EOS itself,  it's mind-numbingly loud and only suitable for  extraordinarily drunk, horny and lazy men too cheap to buy their conversationally challenged drunk female prey and potential one night stand or booty call an appetizer and drink at a place where conversation is possible.   But EOS is not a place for a mature, sensible individual over 25 who wishes to hear without a hearing aid at 45 or 50. She knew what I was talking about and turned down the music, thanking me for my input and promising to pass this along to her manager.   I saw so much I wanted to try on and told her to convey to the boss that women happy to spend three times more on clothing would still think this worth a try. Are the fabrics elegant? No, not really. But cool styles, cuts, and colors.   There are fancy--meaning floor-length--dresses which with accessories would be fine at a black tie optional party. With fall coming on and Christmas around the corner, this is a good place to pick up dresses for the season.   If Cache is, as a rule,  hit-you-hard-over-the-head with mob wife garish glitz, the Area is earth tones and black clothing for the sexy but conservative dresser who likes Haute Hippie and Nicole Miller but lives on 50K not 250K a year.   There is almost nothing over 60 and most regularly priced items are in the 30-40 range (including the dresses). (One review notes a price range from 15 to 150 and there may be a hidden item over 100, but I've never seen anything over 69.) There are tons of cute little tops for over jeans or leggings and on the sale rack, there were shorts and skirts for 20 or so.   Again, you want nice fabric, you have to spend a lot of money or go designer resale (and I pay a lot more than this for my used clothes). But if you're on a budget and you like classy, well-fitting clothes--and you are a size 8 or less--this is the place. Some stuff you could pull off at a size 10 maybe. But this is clothing for LA or SB women who are slender and fit, whether young and single or middle-aged with kids and members of a gym.   Some of the dresses are short but they're not slutty and the colors and cuts tend to keep even the shorter dresses from looking tawdry. Of course, a store is not responsible for improper wear of its garments and if you're not slender, jamming your body into a dress and wearing 7 inch heels--thus creating a ""sausage dress"" effect--is to be avoided.   BRING EARPLUGS or you will emerge with hitherto unknown violent impulses because I swear, this music is so awful there's no way even to begin to say how awful it is (Carrie Fisher in Harry Met Sally on the Roy Rogers wagon wheel coffee table).  P.S. I got a maxi dress with interesting back I wear always to fly to NYC. In winter, I wear a heavy sweater and overcoat and in summer I wear comfort wedges.

"First, congratulations to the Farmers Market they are stepping up the cuisine nicely and C'Bon is proof plenty in such regards.  Hopefully lessor vendors will see fresh quality ingredients properly prepared, and follow such an important example in order to remain relevant. C'Bon also launches itself from Fleur de Lys Cuisine, a prominent caterer in the area, run by Patrick and Jennifer Poumey.  Keep an eye on these two, their future will be remarkably tasty.     Only one drawback  C'Bon is only open on Thursday and Friday. Still though for now it makes the experience even more consuming...and worth it.   C'Bon sets up in the kitchen demo area and keeps a limited yet evolving menu, specializing in Rustic French dishes with various combinations and adorations to gourmet French cooking techniques, serving solid working man portions. In essence, kind of an open air Citizen X Bistro. I know right, let's all divide by zero, we'd all end up there; it's on the other end of the wormhole. Fuck, it's good.

Fresh Green Salad, with home made dressing, and sun dried tomato.  Escalloped potatoes; prepared properly.   Hold on though. They make fresh desserts. I couldn't believe I was reading it on the menu;  Chocolate Fondant. This is one of the hardest desserts to prepare properly, and I gotta say. They damn near nailed it. It was only $4 and meets, or beats most 3 to 4 star restaurants in town. Astounding.   Go there so they are open more.    Update: At last, they are open 5 days a week for lunch.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I saw Carnival of Illusion at the ASU Kerr Center in Scottsdale. A wonderful venue that I had never been to before. It is a bit difficult to find, but matched the show very well.  Carnival of Illusion is a vaudevillian magic act that is as warm and enjoyable as any show I've seen. I'm an enthusiast of magic so I've seen a fair number of shows, and the Carnival of Illusion was my 2nd favorite of all time (!!!)  I will be bringing friends and family to share in the experience. It isn't just magic, the storytelling is fantastic and makes it feel like much more of a show. Details like the tickets being ornate, and the program you get before just add to the enjoyment.  I could not be more impressed by Roland and Susan, the Carnival of Illusion!",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 5.0
"Stopped in for lunch today.  This place was ok, but not sure I would rush back. The menu did have some nice lunch items like salads, but none that stood out that I had to have, sandwiches all ok, but not any sounded like ""yes, I have to have this"", same went for the pastas.  I settled on a hot ham and chees sandwich that I thought said had Swiss cheese, but the Swiss was mixed with yellow cheese, drowning out the Swiss.  The bread was a French roll, and good.  The fries crispy and very good!  Service was very good as well.  It was a bit fancier that I wanted for a work lunch.  It had a fancy inside vibe that didn't really match the food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"This place is not all that. I went here on my birthday. They first told us that our wait would be 20 mins. It was almost a 40min wait. We ordered our food and then it starts to rain. We opted to sit where ever, so the outside seating was available first. Since it started to rain, they didn't even ask if we wanted to be moved or if we wanted our food to go. After waiting 20mins, we still haven't received our food. I told the sever at this time that we would take our food to go. We waited another 10mins, just for them to tell us that our food was ALMOST ready.  I went inside to wait on my food. I waited for another 7 mins. Now, u would think. The food has to be good if I waited all this time, right? WRONG! The orders of french toast I had; wasn't even cooked all the way through. The middle was still uncooked.

Our 2 year old had chicken tenders and fries with 3 baby carrots. My husband had braised rabbit over cream potatoes. I had the shrimp and grits and for desert, pecan pie.

"Horrible!!!   I normally never post reviews but my experience here was so bad I had to write one.  Showed up at 3pm on a Sunday to check-in. Super long checkin line. Then when I finally got to the desk, they said that my room was not ready and that they would text me when it was. I asked how long that would be and they gentlemen said he had no clue. I then looked around and saw the lobby crowded with other guests that looked like they were in the same boat.  It was 7pm before I finally got a room. I called in to check on my room status and was on hold for 1 hour. I then asked if I could leave my bags. I was directed to concierge, but when I got there the desk was unmanned! After 20 minutes the shoeshine guy walked by and he was kind enough to help me check my bags.   They are clearly not prepared for the volume of guests they get.   After a long day of travel you finally get to your hotel only to be welcomed by this. It would have been bearable if they were at least communicative or provided some sort of concessions like free breakfast, drink coupons, or free wifi to make up for it.

"I've heard good things about the Matatdor late night menu for a while so I finally made it in with my girlfriend for some snacks and it was off-the-chain-good. We weren't drinking which makes me feel kind of self conscious in a tequila bar but the staff was totally nice and didn't give us the cheapskate treatment. Like another reviewer said, our water was never below 3/4 full which I really appreciate.  We had a quesadilla, braised pork tacos, and the house chorizo nachos. Heads up, the nachos are enough for 4 hungry people and even with our best effort we might have gotten through half. Everything was really fresh and tasty and our bill was just a hair over $12, CHEEP! The atmosphere there is comfortable but classy; inlaid wood tables, lots of cool custom iron-work, cozy lighting and a fire pit. I think it would be a great place to take people visiting from out of town. I have a pretty fair amount of professional restaurant experience and it's clear that the management here takes their jobs seriously.The bald guy (referenced as the manager by another reviewer) was totally nice, I don't see the problem with the guy showing focus on his dining room and he was nothing but friendly to both of us, as was the rest of the staff. I'm looking forward to making it back soon to sample the tequila menu and grabbing some more food.

"Awful. The food and the service were just awful. I make Hooters Wings at home all of the time, but I don't have their sauces. So I went there with my girlfriend because it was on the water and we're big fans of Hooters. I have got to say we were completely disappointed. The hostess sat us in a spot with the sun in both of our eyes. We couldn't even see the water where we sat because the wall is moronically placed to block your view from the seat. (I am 6'3 mind you). After asking the waitress to move, we were denied another table. Instead, they rolled down the curtain next to my girlfriend and I, completely blocking the view now. That was fine with us. As long as we weren't blinded by the sun anymore. The thing that irked us is the awful cold tasteless wings, and the fact that the waitress made 2 maybe 3 visits to our table the entire meal, and spent the rest of the time talking behind the bar with some boy. Our drinks were empty most of the meal. It  seemed as if our waitress thought she could  get by on sub-par food, location, and looks alone and to be frank, disappointed on all levels.

Nobody asked to replace my wife's dried out sides.   Horrible manager.  Waitress once she knew the food was inedible never came back to the table.    Food generally tastes good there.

The cornish game hen was presented nicely but it was raw in in the inside.

"Whether you will love or hate your experience at VW will depend on how well you plan for the kind of experience that will make YOU happy. Do you like to be in an ""it"" place? Are you OK with crowds and long waits?  If so, then you'll have a good experience braving VW at a prime time (weekend night, lunchtime). If not, there are plenty of times the bar is almost empty and you can enjoy a relaxing, delicious meal and chat with the bartenders - but you'll need to plan to go at an off-peak time. Some of my best VW experiences have been at 2:30 in the afternoon, stopping in for a late lunch and mid-afternoon drink.   I've found the bartenders to be professional, knowledgeable, friendly and accommodating in the extreme. They're always happy to recommend a drink - or even craft one specially for me - based on nothing but the most vague suggestions or knowing what I'm having to eat. I am not a whiskey drinker, but even I can tell that the selection is extensive and the bartenders know their stuff. Whether you are a novice looking to explore or a seasoned whiskey drinker looking for a treat, I'm sure you'll find it here.   The food is very good, although somewhat expensive. My favorite is the pork sammie, which comes with the most incredible fried pickle chips. Although they are only on the menu as an accompaniment for the sandwich, they *will* serve them to you alone if you ask! Which I highly recommend. The first time I ordered the sandwich I was a little disappointed - the meat was overly fatty, and the sauce was overwhelming the bun - but it's improved every time I've eaten it since. The burgers, as the other reviewers attest, are phenomenal.   You should definitely leave some room to try something from the ""pickles"" menu. My favorite are the heirloom tomatoes - they have a wonderful texture and are bursting with flavor. The artichoke hearts were also delicious. All of the pickles are served with very good ricotta spread, tapenade, and bread. These are some of the best deals on the menu, if you're looking for a small bite, they're perfect.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0

"Parc is a constant regular in my restaurant rotation in Philly. I think it is one of the best restaurants in the city. Consistently great service and the food is always top notch. My favorite meal to have here is brunch, but dinner is also great. The prices are reasonable and the portions are generous. When the weather is nice, sitting outside is such a treat, especially on the 18th street/Rittenhouse square facing tables. The bread baskets are also quite delicious and the cranberry walnut bread is hands-down my favorite. They do a great job splitting plates if you let them know when you are ordering which makes it so much easier when you get the food. The ambience of the restaurant is both lively and also quaint. It can be kind of loud when it is crowded but that only adds to the experience in my opinion. Make reservations and reserve the tables by the windows if you are dining inside. If you are wanting to sit outside you have to make the reservations in person at the outside hostess. This restaurant is always crowded so they are definitely doing something right.

"Another sleeper!!  Great Mexican restaurant at the back of the store.  Not much English so bring google translate If needed, but dishes are freshly prepared for mostly Latino clientele. I ate there twice so far. First time I had a burrito, very large and filling. You eat it like they do in Mexico as a sandwich with your hands.  It does not come with any sides.  Second visit I had the chicken mole. It was great. Very large dish with 1/4 chicken, rice,  refried  bean, salad and lots of hot tortillas on the side.  Very fresh, filling and inexpensive to boot.   So if you are in the mood for real Mexican food (not Taco Bell) and you enjoy quality, don't mind a little bit of a sparse atmosphere and want to be totally and completely satiated by a super nice family, this place is awesome!!!

I expressed concern about it at the time but they were so busy today that they didn't acknowledge it and wanted to move on to my nails. So I let it go. When it came to my nails, the same person barely cut my cuticles, filed in a straight line, or buffed my nail beds at all - the whole reason I ever pay for someone else to do my nails. Overall, I wouldn't return or recommend it given there are other salons in the area I find to be better skilled at mani/pedis.

As always it was a pleasurable experience. We got there right when it opened so the server had extra time to talk about the place and go over the menu. He was very accommodating to the fact I was a vegetarian and brought me vegetarian onion soup (which no server had offered me before).  In addition the goal cheese ravioli was delicious but very heavy.  We were given the tour of the kitchen and wine cellar which was the highlight of the trip.  It was very nice that we were able to take our wine with us on the tour and up to the dessert room.  When we arrived upstairs our left overs and bottle of wine was upstairs waiting for us.

"We're talkin' pizza here. But setting the stage for what this is and is not, Tony G's Boise (as named) is not in Boise.  In fact, it is run out of one of roughly 16 ghost kitchens in a production complex in Meridian.  It is not a local pizzeria restaurant.  In fact, it is a virtual appearance of a San Francisco based chain.  It has no storefront from which to order.  In fact, you can only order Tony G's pizza if you download the Crave (ghost kitchen delivery) app (which is clunky in interface design).   My experience with ordering other things from other vendors who operate their virtual chains out of the ghost kitchens at Crave has been underwhelming in the main and lousy for some.  But for what it is I have to say both my husband, a 100% Italian heritage guy who grew up in an Italian neighborhood in Brooklyn and considers himself to 'know' good pizza, and I really enjoyed the Tony G's pizza we ordered.  We would do it again.  But be aware this can be budget buster for cost when all factors of working through Crave are considered.  VARIETIES, SIZES, COST:  There are 3 kinds of pizza available.  Detroit.  Grandma's Sicilian.  Regular.  We chose the latter and it was just right chewy thin crust and the cook on it was just right for us too.  My hubby appreciated that it met his 'fold test'...that is one ought to be able to fold a slice to eat it.  (This I do not 'get' but then I grew up in Portland and Seattle not Brooklyn.) The Regular pizzas are offered in 2 sizes - 13"" and 20"".  Given we wanted leftovers from our meal, and given delivery fee and driver tip added up to about $13, we decided to go for the larger pizza.  Mamma Mia!  That 20"" pie is a biggie of 12 slices that would easily feed four people.  (13"" has 6 slices.)  And this is not a bargain priced endeavor.  The 20"" pizza was $30.  Add tax, delivery fee and tip and you're coming up on $45 for a pie delivered to your door.  YA GETS WHAT YA GETS: Because this is a ghost kitchen created chain menu one does not get to order the pie their way.  The choices are the choices and you cannot add or subtract.  So, for example, the Pigman pizza we ordered last night - the pig being very good crispy bacon in nearly lardon cuts - that came with cilantro could not be ordered without herb for people who think cilantro tastes like soap - as is true for several of my friends.  Or with extra for we who love it.  But for the audience of cilantro haters I would say 'no worries' because the cilantro was so minimal it was nearly impossible to distinguish its' flavor.  That being our minor criticism because it was also true that we said 'thumbs up' for the just right amount of cheese and sauce toppings on this pizza and that the kitchen didn't fall prey to the piling on too much.  After all in pizza, the crust quality is 'the thing' and the toppings should just accentuate it.  As here.  Good for Tony G himself who likely sets the formula for ghost kitchen preparations because there really is a Tony Gemignani living in SF who oversees this chain.  TAKE THEM WITH A GRAIN OF SALT:  Noting some past reviewers - with 0 friends and few reviews - who say they are from out of town and call this the best 'restaurant' in Boise or that they 'love the vibe' of the space (Yelp now moved that probably fake review behind the filter and good they did since Tony G's has no physical space to 'vibe') one might consider them planted reviews to consume for veracity accordingly.  But to  my Yelp friend John S I say ""grazie"" because it was only his high praise review for Tony G's that led me to try it myself.

"I've ordered a few times this year (Covid-19) for take-out.  Being celiac I always order ""the friendly"" bowl on brown rice.  I phone ahead so it is ready for me when I swing by.  There is some parking on the street, a loading zone in front of the building to the south of the store, but during normal traffic, non-covid days, it's usually packed and there is no parking on 109 St.  It's a bowl I eat all of... usually in one sitting.  It's good, but it's not Maui poke.  There's just a little zing missing in the sauce. I can't put my finger on it exactly.  Fish is usually fresh, and there's enough in a serving.  Price... understandable for a stand-alone shop downtown.   Staff wears masks, sanitizer is provided.    They don't accept cash payment - card only , but I always feel a bit guilty about the tip bowl, I don't have any coins (which can be sanitized), and tap to pay doesn't have an option.

The inside of the restaurant is really nice, modern and simple decor. The tables are a little tight together but that doesn't ruin the experience for me. For the first course we ordered the shrimp and scallop spring rolls and the octopus; both were awesome although the octopus kinda freaked me out a little. For my main course I got the lamb and my boyfriend got the short ribs. Both were to die for. The lamb was cooked to perfection with just enough pink still in the middle. The short ribs were so tender you could literally cut them apart with your fork! I would've licked my plate clean if I wasn't a classier lady :)   On to dessert - I had the dip sum doughnuts (they came with jam, frosting and chocolate sauce) and they gave me six of them!

"If this is what is in store for the rest of the Museum with the Gehry make-over, I can't say I'm enthusiastic. Now, I don't know what the recently replaced cafeteria was like, and this may be an improvement, but for the only place to eat (the Museum is rather isolated on a promontory, all very nice, but to leave and find someplace else is not so easy) it should, I think, be less industrial (but I know that is what Gehry is famed for). The butcher block tables family style arranged in rows are antiseptic and clean, but the whole place looks as though it is were designed to use as few hired workers as possible. The food dispensing area is small and cramped, with lots of cakes and sweets that looked fresh, but as for actual food, there were two cooling cases with plastic wrapped sandwiches ($9.00) or plastic tubs of salad ($13) Bud Lite Beer (really?) a white wheat beer, and energy boost drinks. There was some create your own burrito thing going on with one overheated worker crammed into a corner creating your burrito. Next to that, a tub of soup (self-serve) and water with plastic glasses. The trays (am I being too picky?) are so slippery that everything you put on them slides around as you search for a glass for the indifferent and more expensive than an airplane little bottle of wine ...  I can't say this is relaxing. I settled on a small ($3.95) plastic container of curried chicken salad (mayonnaise the essential ingredient) which was ok. But this seems pretty austere for a beautiful Museum in a cosmopolitan city. Any good Korean salad bar has fresher and more varied selections.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

However, we went in to check out the Buffett and it wasn't what I envisioned so we politely left.  We once went to Rigo's in South Tucson and it was wonderful.  Forget that stuff,  we just decided to leave and go down the road to Sir Veza's Taco Garage.  We've been to the Speedway one and it was so loud you couldn't hear yourself think. As I grow older I hate being in real noisy places.   This place must have better acoustics because it was relatively quiet even with all the people there.  Yes, It was mobbed at that hour.    Now, to get to the food.  I got the Garage Style Carnitas Taco platter which came with rice and choice of beans.  I asked the waiter if I could substitute a salad for the beans which he said he could do.  The salad was huge and wonderfully fresh.  The rice was buttery tasting with some corn in it.  The tacos were tasty and very flavorful carnitas.  I'm a huge fan of good carnitas.  I must say that one of them was a bit greasy.  Hubby had the Poblano Relleno stuffed with bbq pork adovada.  It had calabacitas and mashed potatoes on the side.  Both real good.  It's a great fun place especially for younger adults.  Nice bar area with Happy Hour specials on the Beer.

"I have been to Grub twice now, and enjoyed it both times. My favorite part is the originality they put into their menu. My boyfriend always gets the burger with the Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce and raves about it. I myself get the vegetarian option. It too, is delicious. Both burgers contain ingredients that we have never heard of or tried before (i.e. Dr pepper sauce). We love their skinny fries. They are large enough to just order one and split them. Everything is a la cart, which can get pricey, so we cut corners where we can (i.e. sharing fries). Their non alcoholic drink options are great as well. I am a big iced tea lover, and they have 3 or so to choose from, all fresh brewed and on tap for free refills! I am leaving out 1 star on this review simply because I am a mom of 2 and their kids menu is definitely lacking. With such variety and originality within the ""adult"" menu, I'm definitely let down that the kids menu is so limited.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"This is one of those places I remembered from my childhood trip to New Orleans, and I am glad to say it is still a worthwhile stop. We made reservations for 9:00 in the morning, but we probably didn't need to since we were the first family there. The advantage to this was easy and quick access to the breakfast buffet, which included standard breakfast items in addition to fresh crawfish and shrimp and a salad bar. Bacon was crispy, eggs fluffy, kiddie enjoyed the crawfish. The cost? Too expensive, but there's a reason you suck it up. You enjoy your meal in one gorgeous courtyard, which they keep cool with a canopy of leaves and well-positioned fans, and fill with the lovely jazz of their house band (clarinet, banjo, bass fiddle). They played a rousing version of ""What'll I Do?"", which I'd never heard in an upbeat interpretation. Gives a joyful acceptance of loss. I think The Court of Two Sisters will endure long after I'm gone, and my kiddies can take their little ones and enjoy some joyful morning repast.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

They weren't real tasty but the toppings do help mask that. 5 Guys or 96th St Steakburger blows them away on burger quality. Not a Red Robin fan, probably closer to them. Don't get a lot of fries for the price. They were luke warm and soggy. Hope I was there on an off-night. If this is their usual, they won't stick around long. Lots of better places to get a burger.

"Salon Lofts is a large professional space divided up into many individual ""lofts"", each of which is like a mini-salon. So rather than the stylist (or manicurist or whatever the particular proprietor is) having to rent a space in a salon, it is like they have their own small salon. Each salon has a separate entrance and is decorated to the taste of the individual proprietor. It's kind of fun to walk through the building and see how all of the different salons are decorated.  The entire space is super nice, clean, and new. Also, they have a coffee machine!  I love Stacy Brown, in Loft #7 at Salon Lofts on 4th Street. She is fun to talk to, always does a great job on my hair, and doesn't do any hard-sell on products (which I HATE).

Luckily for us, the awesome team of Jenn & Joelle are on hand to make my kids stylish at super reasonable prices.    Jenn is so great with my boys, and they leave with their new post-Covid long hairstyles looking  handsome & slightly badass.

I've been going in there for mos and getting a reheated slice for lunch  - even reheated it still tastes pretty good.

I hope that one of these nights I can take my wife up there and get a freshly made pie, eat a few slices off it, and save the rest for breakfast.

She came back to tell us that this info was incorrect on Facebook even tho it was added by the chef at 8:28 this morning AND was still on Facebook.  We decided to leave & go elsewhere.

"Really dissapointed in our first experience. I LOVE the fortville location, but we had our kids with us last night and thought this would be an awesome alternative. We had a reservation for 7pm, and as we waited beyond 7pm for our table, we watched a couple of other tables at the restaurant just sit open. When we were sat, we were sat at a table right next to the door, which isn't a huge deal on its own, but with two small kids and other open tables, you would think they would have sat us at one further away from the draft. Host staff didn't seem attentive. We were greeted before we even got our coats off to sit down, where we ordered waters while we looked over the drink menu. We ordered a beer and margarita at the same time we ordered our food, and we never got those drinks (I love the fortville margaritas!) so I can't even review them. When dinner finally came and we still had no bar beverages, we decided not to even remind our server because we kind of just wanted to eat and leave at that point. Other than the drink situation, service was about 8/10, everything came out as ordered. Food was delicious, as I expected. $4.50 for fries is a little outrageous, but I think everything else is priced fairly. The experience was just soooo disappointing. Will probably not be back to that location.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

I wanted to get some salsa but after seeing it, felt walking away was the safe thing to do.  My girlfriend had the taco salad. The shell was good and crispy, the cilantro was fresh.

"We used to come back here a lot when I was a kid, and then as we grew older, we didn't come as much, perhaps because it's so ghetto.  Finally came here a couple months ago; service was ok, the usual Chinese restaurant service.  Food was average, my mom could probably make it just as good at home, and the portion sizes are nothing to write home about either.  The dishes came out pretty fast though.  I didn't like how little sauce they had for the peach shrimp.  I have a rule of thumb when it comes to Chinese restaurants: if there are more non-Chinese customers, then it's probably not very good, which is exactly what I witnessed during our dinner.   I'd probably place them more of a 2.5 star, due to how underwhelming my meal was.

The crawfish has very salty seasonings but it's delicious regardless. It's fun peeling them off and such a rewarding experience. I loved the BBQ shrimps, especially the sauce which is perfect to use as dipping sauce for their bread (you do have to pay a few bucks to get extra bread. Why???)

I love the pizza, I love the fresh herbs, I love the chili oil they serve with everything, but I feel like I end up spending at least $20 for a personal pizza.  It has a cool vibe.  Maybe a little hipster or something.  Great workers.  I like the new manager.  However, I just find it hard to go back when there are so many other options so close.

I went back to the Microcentet to discuss repair.  The manager of the service counter literally pulled the laptop from my arms and then he and his team proceeded to tell me the entire top panel needed replaced.  They estimated the work to be approximately $350.  After disappearing to the back with my laptop for about 15 minutes, they came back and told me the repair would cost $800.   And they charged me $42 for this process.  I went to two smaller local technical repair shops.  Both told me I only needed the touch screen component repaired not the entire panel.

"Second time at the dog and Bull. The first time with mediocre to slightly above mediocre but worth giving it another shot. Tonight certainly helped make my decision whether or not to revisit again. There were seven of us for dinner and rather than go on a diatribe of how unbelievably poor the service was, Will bypass that and just tell you it was some of the worst service I've ever had my 56 years. Our server was rude, and quite frankly sucked as a server. No silverware, warm water and what I asked for ice we got enough ice for 2 people. Eye rolls galore no follow through and didn't give a shit whether our food prepared properly or not.. my nine-year-old son ordered the fillet mignon and it was over cooked although the moronic manager disagreed. Regardless they prepared another steak it was cooked to well done he asked my son to cut into it had nothing to say. I said good help is hard to find. He did not care and decided to argue with us instead. This place is the absolute pits, not just because the food and service sucks because the management does as well. I've been in business most of my adult life and I understand customer service, they do not. They will never get another cent of my money.

My girlfriends cocktail (which was supposed to be some sort of boozed tea) came out tasting like warm dish-water. The eggplant mignion entree is an absolute joke - it's literally a giant piece of eggplant with out-of-the-can tomato sauce. The rabbit pasta was disappointing as well. The croque provencial sandwich had super hard bread which was almost impossible to chew.

"Ok....let me just say this... Johnny Mananas has been one of my most FAVORITE mexican restaurants for a long time now. Even though I live in South Philly...and even though its not right in the city....I still try to get there often...b/c it's seriously one of those places that you crave...b/c everything is so good. I have taken many friends from out of town there, and even had a Christmas party there one year.....and everyone absolutely LOVED it. The food is/was amazing.....the margaritas were the best EVER! It had been a while since I had the chance to get there, and last week I was in the area and could not wait to get in there and get my Mananas fix. My husband and I walked in, and it seemed strangely quiet.....and the bar look extremely bare. We were informed that there is a limited menu, and that we could not purchase any margaritas....only get one each (complimentary)...but we had to order food. So...we ordered chips and salsa (b/c of the limited menu).....and waited for our margaritas. As I said...there were maybe 5 other customers in there at the time. We waited about 5 minutes for the margaritas...and about 10-15 for our stale chips and salsa. All the while....the person in charge was yelling at all the girls who were working there.....in front of everyone. We asked what was going on...and the guy in charge (who also is apparently the new person in charge of the kitchen)... and he told us the basement had flooded, and the whole staff had been fired.... now its a whole new staff....and when they got the liquor license back...that everything was going to be different...including the menu. This makes me sad...b/c the menu I know and love....was the BEST! I will give it one more shot once everything is  up and running again.....hopefully things will be more in order..... and the food is just as good as before... if not......they lost a loyal customer.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I generally eat healthy and needed a break from my usual sushi and salads. I came across Ka'Moon on Yelp and I was very intrigued to give this place a try. I stopped by during lunch time and opted for the power bowl. They have two kiosk's for you to place the order, or you can order directly at the register.   In terms of the food, it's a great value for a little over $11. The hummus base ($8) and the grilled chicken ($3), and a few more toppings such as tomatoes, spinach, green onions, and feta make a very nutritious and filling meal. The texture of the hummus is a bit off, slightly too gritty for my personal taste but I've had some awesome hummus in Israel so I'm a hard one to please. The flavor is good though if they can only improve on the texture then I would rate their food 5/5. The grilled chicken is also very flavorful. The combination of hummus, protein (of your choice) and the toppings really work well together. I wish I can order a side of pita bread to go with the power bowl which it wasn't an option from the kiosk. Perhaps I can ask the staff next time since they already have shawarma on the menu. I think it would enhance the dish even more.   Overall - recommended and will try the rice bowl next time! :)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Haven't been here in years!  My friends and family surprised me with a small get together to celebrate my birthday here. Maggianos has the table all ready based on the reservation made and even decorated the table with birthday confetti. Big plus in my book as they help to make the experience memorable. The waitress was good and came to take our drink orders as soon as we sat down, gave us menus and explained options available--family style and some other specials they had going on. We ordered some appetizers and sangria (white). Appetizers were fast to come out and the taste was great. Loved the zucchini appetizer we ordered. The white sangria was so good as well, very refreshing!  The manager did have to come over and check on things and noticed that we didn't have appetizer plates so she apologized and brought some over.   Time to order--I ordered the eggplant parmigiana which is one of my favorite dishes. Because I ordered from the pasta section I was also able to choose a take home meal which I chose the Alfredo. My daughter ordered the Mac and cheese which she said was just ok. She preferred Daddy's sausage Rigatoni. Everyone at the table was served their meals except for my best friend who merely ordered a sausage flatbread. We asked status and was told it'd be out momentarily. The waitress brought out the meals of another table and also had the flatbread. She laid the flatbread on the other table while setting some other food down for them and the flatbread ended up falling to the floor. Well there goes the food. By this time we were half way done with our meals. The waitress came over to let her know that it'll be remade quickly. She just advised them to just box it up and she'd take it because it's already been so long. We were all done with our meals and onto desserts before the boxed flatbread came.

Had the pork ribs, thai salad, cole slaw, bbq sandwich.  I really wanted to love this place because we seriously lack bbq in SB but the reality was that it was just so-so.  Our waiter didn't provide the best service at all.  He almost seemed a little put off by answering questions, somebody spilled at the table and he didn't take the time to wipe it off.  We used our own napkins (really?)  The BBQ had decent flavor but didn't fall off the bone. I've had better.  The cole slaw was great, the fries, great.  Thai salad flavor great, but the chicken was mushy (maybe overcooked/left over?).  They've only been open a few months and probably have some growing pains ahead of them.

Oh, and the burgers...delish!!!  If you haven't been there you are missing out on a flavor sensation for your mouth.  There is a full liquor bar to go with your BBQ too.

"Do yourself and take a walk over to this place, even if you're not vegan - great  park! Lots of historical  stuff, and a grassy amphitheatre  + a farmers market surrounds a bbuildingof healthy vegan vegetarian foods like this place.  This is my first time to Nashville so after a day of following around my friends and trying out a place for BBQ, the vegan here could only eat mashed potatoes, sweet corn and apples for $11 - was not happy. I was SO HAPPY to find this place was around the corner from my hotel hours later.  The flavor for the tofu vegan curry was not bad at all - definitely a win in my book. I'm having the BBQ chkn this evening with collard greens and plantains so I'm really looking forward to that.   To cap it off, they have some delicious fresh squeezed carrot juice and pineapple ginger - MUST GETS!",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 4.0

I generally have a great experience here but today popped in with a friend around 2 pm for a drink outside and was curtly dismissed because we weren't planning on eating. There was 1 table seated outside and overall the restaurant was quiet.

"If you haven't been here in awhile, it's time to come back! I came in for a late lunch on a Friday and had a delicious meal.  They offer some great lunch specials, so I tried their combo of sushi and sashimi, which also came with choice of California roll or spicy tuna roll, plus soup or salad.  I opted for salad, which was just bagged lettuce with ginger dressing, but it was fine. I also chose the spicy tuna roll, which was excellent; more tuna than rice, which I love.  Presentation was beautiful, and both the sushi and sashimi were cut into surprisingly generous pieces. Everything tasted very fresh and it was all quite flavorful. Altogether, it was a much better experience than when I had visited several years ago, when it was under different management, and vowed never to return.  It's a small place, located in a strip mall, but has plenty of tables, plus sushi bar seating.  The one waitress was quick, efficient and friendly, and I can't wait to try their two roll lunch special.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"One thing Sasquatch Tavern & Grill has right is the atmosphere. It's a small restaurant with not much seating inside but they do have a patio with outside seating as well. The decor makes it feel like a neat mix of old time pub with a neighborhood bar feel. The river rock fireplace, log accents give you a comfortable feeling. I ordered the Jambalaya Pasta. I think I may have set my expectations a bit too high because the pasta was not as good as I was expecting. It had shrimp, chicken, and sausage with bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes. I'll eat bell peppers but I'm not a big fan of them. There were a lot of them in the dish and they were not small slices either. Also the sauce, while it tasted good, was very messy when you eat it which won't be a problem if you learn from my mistake and wear a napkin. My friend got the burger which he said was good. They practice all the proper precautions for covid compliance. I will definitely be back again to try other menu items.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I used to love eating here, but my visit a couple of days ago was very disappointing. I ordered the lunch special cashew shrimp with hot and sour soup. My soup was not warm. When I received my cashew shrimp it was very spicy. I asked the waitress if it was supposed to be spicy even though it was not indicated as being spicy on the menu. The waitress stated that it is supposed to be spicy, but it depends on a persons tastebuds. She offered me hot sauce for my dish. I explained to her that it was already extremely spicy. I am a fan of spicy food, but it was even so spicy for me that I could barely eat any of my meal. My wife got the sesame chicken lunch special. Her food was very mediocre also. When I got the bill I noticed that the price of her meal was $9.99 even though on the menu it is listed as $7.99. I asked the waitress why it was two dollars more and was told that it cost more because the chicken is breaded. I'm not sure why breading is that expensive, but I will save my two dollars and go to a restaurant where I will get quality food for my money.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"It's really hard to get excited about Hot Dogs but the The Dog of Nashville does a good job of adding to Wow fact to an otherwise plain food item.  They offer a large variety of customized hotdogs on their menu as well as traditional sides such as chili, fries, and onion rings.  I tried the special of the month, The Miss Saigon, a hotdog topped with pickled carrots, cucumbers, and sirachia mayo aioli.  I was a real big fan of their french fries, they sliced super thin which makes them very crispy.  The menu also has items such as burgers, corn dogs, and vegan hot dogs.  They also have a fair selection of beers on their menu as well.  Everything on the menu was priced well and won't break your pocket book.  The Dog of Nashville is located in an old residence on Belcourt so you may have to pay for parking during the day but there are typically plenty of spots on the street.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Bistro Romano did not disappoint for our 6 year anniversary celebration!   We arrived around about 20 minutes early for our reservation. The hostess offered to either have us seated early, or have a few drinks at the bar. We opted to be seated right away to start our meal.  Upon arriving to our table, we noticed it was tucked away in a romantic corner away from 3 other busy tables of 6-10 people per table and the table was lined with fresh rose petals and a candle lit. None of the other tables had it, so I assume they put that there for our anniversary which was very very sweet and we noticed the attention to detail.   After perusing the menu, we opted to go with the $65 5 course meal. We did not opt for it, but they also have a +$30 for wine pairing. The 5 course can either be any random selection by the chef's choice, or you may choose 4 items off the regular menu (2 antipastis +1 pasta or 2 pastas + 1 antipasti, and  1 entree) + choice of dessert. I enjoyed every single course.   Starting with the homemade bread, the homemade ""pesto"" was not your usual basil green pesto, but more of a sweeter red pepper based one it seemed. With the Chef's Tasting, to our surprise it came with an amuse bouche which was the soup of the day. The soup was incredibly rich and perfect. There was a smoky taste to it, with bright notes of the fresh herbs chopped on top, the sweet tomato, and tender cannelini beans.   Our next course was the burrata with black truffle, peas and crispy leek, such a thoughtful dish. The peas were nice and chilled, which brought a nice light refreshing feel, to contrast the rich burrata. The truffle was not overpowering, and the crispy leeks brought such nice texture to bring the entire dish together.    Next were our 2 pasta dishes ( all pastas are made fresh in house daily). We opted for the gnocchi with white and black truffle cream and proscuitto along with the Lobster Ravioli in a sherry cream sauce. Let it be known that gnocchi is one of my top food loves and I take it very seriously. The gnocchi was perfect, put a smile right on my face. Light, fluffy, perfect little pillows in a rich, succulent truffled cream sauce. The only unfortunate part is that this is the point of my meal that I started to feel sick on our anniversary. The server noticed I hadn't touched the last couple gnocchi and we had it boxed up. The same went for my lobster ravioli, I was only able to take a bite of one and had to have it wrapped up. Please note that I felt sick due to my own accord - it had nothing to do with our meal or the restaurant (my partner seemed completely fine and still is as I'm writing this review).   The entree we went for was the Brodetto which is an amazing stew of lobster, scallop, shrimp in a rich saffron sauce. Again I was sick, so I didn't get to fully enjoy it - but everything was cooked perfectly. There is a generous piece of lobster, a scallop, lump crab and 2 shrimp - but by this point of the meal I promise you it's more than enough to not eat egregiously. All the seafood was cooked to the perfect temperature and the saffron broth is such a nice compliment along with the cous cous for texture. I can smell the broth now as I write this review.  The server came by and asked and offered to wrap our dessert up as she noticed we were slowing down (especially me). My partner mentioned to her that I was feeling sick so we would really appreciate the dessert to go. The only reason I knocked it down half a star/1 star was due to this. After I started feeling sick, it still took roughly 30 minutes to get our food wrapped up, dessert, and the check. I was hoping for a bit more urgency, but that's just because i was feeling really horrible and nauseous. I understand most likely they were still  prepping the flourless chocolate cake to go, and maybe our server didn't realize how sick I was feeling.   Outside of that though, I really enjoyed my meal despite how sick I was. If the business ends up reading this, I really hope you pass along to your chef and staff how amazing the menu and food was, and how I felt everything was so well thought out for a balanced dish. The service was great as well (despite what I mentioned). She was an experienced server that didn't require prompting and noticed little things like how I was slowing down on my food. The food runners were also very friendly and personable, with one of them telling us the Brodetto is one of their most famously ordered and popular dish. The ambiance is just perfect for a special occasion of taking out family or date night.   I definitely plan on coming back - and hope I can properly enjoy without being sick next time!  *Tip* You can also order any pasta at half size for half the price, as long as it accompanies an entree order*",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Its a rare day that I eat fried chicken. Its not that I don't like it, because I really do, its just that so few places outside of the south do it well. Fast food style chicken is usually a total no-go for me, so you can imagine my pleasant surprise at the great experience I had here.   Our group had the 8 piece meal deal with biscuits and a large side (cajun fries). The fries were great, seasoned well and just perfectly crispy. Some of the best fries I've had really. We had the spicy chicken and it was just that. Spicy coating was cooked to a crispy perfection, not limp like so many places make it. It really had a nice kick too it. The chicken itself was juicy and fresh (and piping hot) and the pieces were all large and succulent. No tiny filler pieces tossed in. I didn't try the biscuits (not a favorite item and don't need the calories, but others liked them. And this was a great deal at $15.

"This is the last straw. Been a long time patron to both midtown and south location because I LOVE the food and actually the staff! Been calling ahead of late because busy with work and 8 out of 10 times I'm out on hold for extended time, till I finally hang up and go somewhere else. This last time I hung up and called back to be greeted with a busy signal. Did this three more times, then went to somewhere else yet again. Also the time before last I was greeted over the phone by a guy who seemed like he could just not be bothered, poor attitude and majorly lacked customer service skills. Also when I picked up my order I paid and left to only get back to my work and find the dressing missing. The food is not the problem but my experience via the maturity and competency of the staff is a major deterrent and I won't be back for some time. Disappointed because I love the food but having negative experiences like this put me in a bad mood when I'm trying to give my loyal support through my patronage.

"I was completely underwhelmed by the food here. I was expecting it to be much better.   To start, the waiter offered us wild boar ravioli. It's well known that intact male pigs produce a hormone that creates an offensive taste in the meat. (I work in the Pork industry.) So, I'm not sure why they would offer this. More likely, they're passing off regular pork as wild boar. An odd start for sure.   We had a pork belly appetizer. It was nothing special. By that I mean it hadn't been cooked long enough to render the fat at all. So, it tasted like fatty thick bacon that was undercooked.   I had salmon as my entree. It was plated on a spaghetti squash mixture. Again, it was very average. The spaghetti squash was not that great. My wife had a pasta with chicken. It was ok, but not any better than something you would get at Olive Garden.   Based on the value vs quality, I'm completely disappointed. We spent $100 on a meal for two. We did not have any wine.

Additionally the menu changes daily so you'll never get bored eating here. They don't take reservations so plan accordingly.

While the lunch menu has a more limited selection of cheeses, meats and only sandwiches, the taste is up to par with dinner. The cheese and bread (from Amelia's) is baked fresh and served on an adorable log with a very pairing jam. The fries come in a retro container but have a very strong taste. Dessert menu is the same as dinner time.  Dinner portions are split into small, medium and large sizes but are designed for a comfortable full level. The Foie Gras was buttery smooth and the ingredients were fresh and complimentary. The other dishes I tried were phenomenal as well.

"I went to this Starbucks this past Sunday morning.  I ordered two drinks; a venti latte & a grande frap.  I was in a bit of a hurry so once I got my drinks, I grabbed them & left.  Once I got to where I needed to be, I took a drink of the latte & realized there wasn't any coffee in the drink!  There was only syrup & milk.

"I went to Violino on November 1 with a friend.  It had been ages that we didn't go out for a bite and so went there to enjoy a nice evening of (what I thought) good food and good company (this part was PERFECT :-]) Our waiter was nice enough, however, we quickly realized that the table of 6 was a definite ""attention taker"" (and rightly so, afterall, whose bill is going to be more?) Anyway, enough ""cattiness""...on to the meal....  Given the weather, I ordered the Linguine al Sambuca (btw, it should be ""ALLA"" Sambuca because SambucA is feminine.....I get upset about this ESPECIALLY when the owner is an Italian SPEAKING Italian..... ).  To my utter disappointment, not only was it ""sticky"" (because the cream cooled/ too much cheese/SOMEthing) but the linguine were overcooked :-(  My appetizer was the crab cakes (Friteele di Cranchi), however, I felt like I was eating shredded crab from a can.....the crab cakes  were also topped with cooked red peppers and onion (why would you cover the taste of crab?).  And by the way, ""Fritelle"" are ""Fritters""....these crab cakes didn't look nor have the texture of  ""Fritelle/Fritters"".  My friend ordered the Halibut alla Violino, with which she fared MUCH better than I, truth be told.....along with her Caprese appetizer.  However, the downer was as she was drinking her water and she ended up with a hair off the glass....she was fine, but we decided to order a bottle of Pellegrino at that point.  We didn't order dessert.....for no other reason than nothing attracted our fancy.....  Mi sa che it will be long while until I go back.  Meanwhile, I know that the owner is the Chef that used to work at Santa Maria Goretti's Hall and I heard he was wonderful there.....but then again, HE isn't the one cooking ......",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I went to El Molinito on 2/21/13 and made reservations for our 40th anniversary party. The party was scheduled for 6/15/13. Over the next 4 months, my friends and family stopped several times to take pictures, measure, etc. Each time we spoke with Ramon, the manager. We ordered linens and chair covers to fit their tables and chairs. We hired a DJ and videographer. We arranged for a cake and flowers to be delivered.   On 6/6/13, I went in and gave Wayne our final head count and menu choices. On 6/7/13, I went to take pictures of where the sun was at 5 P. M. I needed to know if I had to rent umbrellas so everyone would be in the shade. I happened to see Ramon and asked him if Wayne had given him my head count and menu.   He said he remembered me but didn't have any paperwork and didn't know anything about our party! He said there was another party booked! We had 65 guests and family coming from 5 states! What was I going to do?   I pointed out HIS HANDWRITING on my paperwork. He just said he was sorry they had double-booked. What if we'd all shown up for our party on the 15th?

"We were in Wesley Chapel for a gymnastics meet and thanks to Yelp we found the Noble Crust.  I'm not really big on chain restaurants but this location is great.  We made reservations for a table of 10 and when we arrived our table was ready with a ""reserved"" sign and we had no wait.   All of the items we had on the menu were really great.  We started with the meatballs and were really impressed.  They are a beef and pork blend and they were so juicy and savory especially with a dollop of ricotta on top.  The fried green tomatoes and crispy brussel sprouts would make any kid eat their veggies.  Both were excellent.  Of course the kids did devour the truffle fries but who wouldn't.  Being in a Pizza place of course we have to order their pizza so we got the Noble Pig which came topped with pepperoni, sweet fennel sausage, spicy soppressata, pickled peppers, caramelized onions, tomato sauce, fontina, parm, and sunny side up egg.  All i have to say is WOW it was a cornucopia of 2,000 calorie deliciousness.    Overall the service and food here were awesome. I would definitely recommend coming here for a great meal if you are in the Wesley Chapel area.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I really like the Jim's Steaks on South Street and if you look, most of the positive reviews for this particular location near the Roosevelt Mall are actually intended for the South Street location.    My boyfriend and I went to this Jim's steaks and will never return.  The service was slow, the employees unfriendly, the cheesesteaks were beyond greasy (We can appreciate grease, but this was disgusting!) and when our cheese fries came without cheese, the employee we asked about it seemed mad at us and argued that we didn't order cheese.  We nicely pointed out on the receipt that we did indeed ask and pay - for cheese.  In retaliation, he covered the fries in so much cheese, it was more akin to a cheesy potato soup.    We both only ate half our cheesesteaks before getting sick, puking and throwing out the rest.  What a waste of $22!!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

Even though there are lines and things are hectic, the management back there has it all together. They are efficient and friendly (my fav combination). We had the pork taco and the chicken taco. Both were good but I liked the chicken a little more. The pork taco was a BBQ like pork rolled in a tortilla with rice. Pork was tender and the rice was well cooked. The chicken taco had a well seasoned portion of chicken with an Asian flare. I'm not quite sure what was in there but it was a tasty red spicy sauce.

I dutifully kept the secret until now... but with the pandemic ravaging the restaurant industry I think that it's time to let others in on the secret.

"Wowie! The food was INCREDIBLE!  If you want authentic Chinese food, you must come here.  I had the privilege of coming in to join my fellow Yelpers for Supper Club here last week.  We ordered family style which, honestly, is the only way to eat here so you can taste a little bit of everything!  All of the dishes were so flavorful and absolutely divine!  Make sure to order from the Szechwan menu!  My favorite dishes were the ginger chicken, chinese broccoli & beef, salty & spicy shrimp, and the water boiled beef.    The water boiled beef is a spicy dish...that very first bite caught me by surprise! It was a bit (temperature) hot, but it did not stop me from having it. Boy, did it have a kick though! =)  Mmmm!  Eat it with the fried rice!  We also had this cold beef appetizer, the Spicy Tri-tip, which was also very tasty.  Different, but very good!  It had some cilantro, and different types of meat in it (so much flavors, it was like a fiesta in my mouth!).  I also can't say enough about the ginger chicken and the salty & spicy shrimp. That sauce for the ginger chicken, mmmm so creamy and delish! And ooh, that shrimp was just enough salty as it was spicy too! It was definitely a plus being with fellow yelpers who were from china or of chinese decent, as they were able to tell us what we absolutely needed to try and also were able to speak to the server in their native tongue.  It was really great getting to know their culture too!  (Thanks guys!)  The only downside to the place was getting the refills on our water or drinks.  As I mentioned, the food we had was a bit spicy, so I needed quick refills!  Lol.  All in all though, its one of the best Chinese places in town!

The last three times I went, it took over 2 and a half hours to do a gel manicure, which is very abnormal.  They didn't paint to the edges of the nails, or even do straight lines.  The massage was 2 minutes and didn't constitute an actual massage.  I asked politely if they could correct the paint job, and the lady took a color that didn't match my nails and painted a streak over the nails she had just done.  She then told me if I paid again she would fix them, although she had just worsened them by adding the wrong color. It was so strange, I just got up and left before she could do any more damage.

Came here to meet a friend of mine for coffee and I'd never gone before. I walked in through the Barber door and was in shock for a second because I thought that I'd gone to the wrong location but apparently I just can't read. One of the barbers saw my shocked expression and asked kindly if I was looking for the coffee shop and then pointed me through a door. The coffee shop is so cute with plants and tiger-like wallpaper covering the walls. It has a very distinct smell that smells good but was slightly overwhelming at first but that's simply because I have a sensitive nose. I got a simple cappuccino with no add-ons and it was amazing. The cappuccino was just the right amount of creamy and was also a way better price than if I'd got it anywhere else. If you don't like coffee they also have other non-coffee options that sounded delicious. We stayed for two hours just hanging out and talking and of course drinking our coffee but there were others who were having an interview or working on school work. The staff was very laid back and didn't try to rush us out or even come up to us after we got our drinks which I actually loved.

They enforced a ""zero tolerance"" policy on Halloween weekend but somehow we still had to endure through a blasting 3.5 minutes of Master P telling us to ""Make 'em Say Uhhhh.""  The Orange Tree Inn is on State St but it's 1+ mile away from the downtown scene. And cabs don't really frequent the surrounding area so be prepared to walk 30 min to get to the bars. It's also a short drive from the Old Mission Santa Barbara.  If you don't plan on sleeping much, and will be too wasted to notice how uncomfortable the bed is when you do pass out, grab your slippers, bring your own linens, don't forget the disinfecting wipes, and score yourself a cheap room at the Orange Tree, only $6-10 cab ride away from State St nightlife.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 2.0
"Look no further, get your alterations here! I brought my wedding gown here after getting alteration estimates from 2 other places. Diana gave me a fixed price that was $150 lower than the the others in addition to a much faster completion timeline. At my second fitting I asked he to take the hips in more and remove some of the layered tulle - she happily and flawlessly accommodated me with no additional charge! Her prices are fixed, fair and perfect for a bride on a budget. My dress is perfectly tailored and looks amazing.

Running some errands on Monday 3/23 decided to get a bite to eat.  As stated it was Monday in New Orleans which is red beans and rice day.  I have been to New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood company in the past.  At that time I was not very impressed but I figured it would be easy and red beans are pretty simple to do.  I placed my order around 4 for red beans and rice and an order of hush puppies. Sat at a table and displayed my order number.  After I sat within 5 to 10 minutes others sat around me.  One individual in front of me and 2 individuals to the left of me.  At this time it looked like they were having a shift change on the floor.  The new individual came to our tables and introduced herself.  When she got to the single individual in front he asked to check on his order and it was brought out within 5 minutes red beans.  The 2 individuals on the left also got there order red beans.  This was now around 25 minutes after I sat.  I gave them around 10 minutes then decided to get a refund and leave.  Few things bugged me.  Bad service first.  Also when I was parking I saw the individual coming on shift getting out of a car coming to work.  When that individual came to my table the apron she was wearing was dirty with food I assume from her last shift.  Looks like it was not washed.  Then it took the manager quite a while to figure how to refund my credit card.  When he did he did not refund the tax that was charged.  At that time I just wanted to get out.  Then finally lack luster food from my past experiences.  This all adds up to me never giving them another chance and telling everyone I know to stay far far away.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Mmmmmmmm yummy!  I love how you can order a mini-carafe of wine (oh I know, it has a fancier name than 'carafe').  The house salad was absolutely scrumptious, the perfect amount of dressing.  My boyfriend ordered the chopped salad, and I kept stealing the tiny fresh mozzarellas off his plate.  Num-num-nums!  We ordered the chicken pesto pizza.  The pizza crust was outstanding - it reminded me of Dewey's, which has some of the best crust in the St. Louis land.  Crisp and lightly doughy.  I wasn't terribly impressed with the pesto sauce - it wasn't very flavorful.    All in all, they may have a few kinks to get over - but if you want quality pizza in South City, this is a true hidden gem.  My guess is that they will only continue to improve over time.  I can't wait to try the strombolis and calzones.  I have a distinct feeling that the more traditional italian-style fare will knock my socks off.  Our waitress seemed a little bit... what's the word?  Oh, stoned.  But that didn't really bother me.  She wasn't the greatest but she wasn't terrible - and I was eating pizza and drinking wine, so I really didn't care.  The interior is cute x 1,000, and I'm looking forward to trying their take-home products (pasta sauces, etc.)  I love the bigger-city feel of this joint.  I'd love to see them put a few tables outside!  Quick, casual bite to eat near home.  Good times.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 4.0
"I really enjoyed this pizzeria. The food is good and the service is nice. The only issue I had was that it took a really long time to get two sandwiches.

"Tap Room On 19th is one of those places I meant to visit for years but was always too lazy to actually make the trip. After a local gathering recently at the new brewery, our friend group moved here and I realized I recognized the immediate neighborhood. Turns out the place is like half a block from where my paternal grandparents used to live back in the day! How neat.  So anyway, it was a busy Friday evening but I walked up to the bar and was instantly served. I ordered by number, which was probably weird and not something I'd usually do, but they make it easy to order by number and I did get the right beer so I guess it wasn't an issue.  Their tap list is strong and offers a good range of beers. I also tried a bite of a cheesesteak that was brought out for a friend. It was delicious! I need to go back and have a real meal one of these days.  Also, word to the wise: lock the bathroom door behind you. If you fail to and you use the back one, the whole room will get a show. I'm pretty sure dude didn't even notice when I opened (and shut the door as fast as possible!) but other rando folks did and thought it was hilarious. Whoops.  The atmosphere was fun and now that I've actually made the step of, you know, walking in the front door, I'm sure it'll be easier to return in the future -- perhaps in the summer when they host fun events and what-not. It certainly seems to be a South Philly gem!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Market area also improved to feature the items needed to supplement a weekly Target run. Change is hard, especially in Sam Hughes, I do miss the old U of A athletics posters, but Rincon needed to modernize and it did so in a way to that still kept it neighborhood and family friendly.

This was by far the worst hotel I ever stayed at. First I paid for the hotel on Hotels.com and the only payment they was suppose to take from me is the security deposit. When I checked out they charged my card twice both for another night and the security deposit. Now I have an over daft on my account and everyone at the hotel don't know what's going on.  When I called them to see why the lady at the front desk was rude and said she has nothing to do with it and hung up on me. The room was okay but the shower water barley got hot. To make matters even worst when we got to the hotel there elevators was down they tried to put us on the 8th floor and I made them put me on the third.

"When a place is worthy of a good rating, I'll gladly heap praise on them.  The customer service is some of the worse I've ever encountered at a lodging facility.  I called downstairs twice to speak with the manager or supervisor on duty and they placed me on hold and never came back to the phone.  The wi-fi at this hotel is terrible and you cannot be productive if you have a laptop or tablet and need to get online, the signal constantly drops.  There is some construction project going on, so the 4th floor is dusty and loud. I heard housekeeping outside my door and they were quite loud and unconcerned with guests hearing their exchanges.   The parking is pretty bad, you'll have to park far away from the entrance if you arrive late. This was my first time trying a Comfort Inn and I realize that one location is not representative of an entire chain.   But I can say that you should consider alternatives to this particular lodging facility.   Avoid this place.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 1.0
"This Office Depot location has the worst customer service. Even when a customer is trying to make a simple over the counter transaction they harass you into giving personal information. The don't ASK whether the customer would like to provide info to receive a rewards/discount card. Instead they just immediately demand info during the transaction to sign you up. I was in the Central West End, St. Louis location on Lindell yesterday and what I watched was a shame. The person in front of me was attempting to purchase a pack of batteries and after scanning the item the salesperson immediately demanded ""NAME"" . The customer hesitated then gave his name. Then the salesperson demanded ""PHONE NUMBER"" the customer hesitated again and gave his phone number. Then the salesperson said ""EMAIL"" then the customer DECLINED to provide any more info & said no. The salesperson said ""U DON'T WANNA GIVE ME YOUR EMAIL!?"" The salesperson said ""I'm signing you up for a discount."" The customer sighed and said fine and gave his info. Seriously. A customer should be asked whether they want to share their personal information and for what purpose the information is being sought PRIOR to demands for the info. That way a customer can quickly and politely decline to share their personal information if they choose not to participate. What a horrible customer experience.

My absolute favorite bar in New Orleans  The bartenders are like artists making delicious alcohol-based art.    Super-legit and fairly priced - I just kept trying drink after drink off the extensive menu - and was never disappointed.    I try to stay abreast of different cocktails and ingredients when out at cocktail bars but this place had tons of stuff I had never even heard of... and it all worked.

"So, I finally went to the new location. It was...ok. I don't remember the food being spectacular in Carson, not that it was bad, and it still isn't. What has changed fairly significantly in my mind is the atmosphere. Their location in Carson definitely felt like a trendy micro-brew pub. Everything was clean, new, and attractive. In their new location, it is too open, much darker, and already seems to feel like an old dive bar in the way some of the decor looks worn. I don't know that this is intentional. I will certainly be back at some point to enjoy their happy hour specials, but I don't see me choosing this place for dinner in its current state. I almost forgot to mention, the beer does still keep me happy.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 3.0

"Definite potential.  So, stopped by here this afternoon to ""wine"" down from the week.  Hehe.  Anyway.  They have a very nice patio.  We chose to sit outside.  It was happy hour which was a nice surprise.  They offer $2.00 off drafts (I think) and anywhere from $1-2 off wine by the glass, depending on the wine.  I had a decent pinot noir which ended up being $5/glass for happy hour.  That I like.  My friend and I split the Fig and Brie Flatbread and the Asian Salmon Burger with sweet potato fries.  The flatbread was very tasty (even though I had to scrap the bacon off... dang you Lent!)  That being said, it was a little small.    The Salmon burger was pretty tasty.  There was a nice relish on it and hoison sauce.  The bun was very light and fluffy and fresh.  The sweet potato fries were very good, but they serve it with a bottle of ketchup.  I wish they had some sort of yogurt dipping sauce or something like that instead.  Our waitress was great.  She was prompt, gave us just the right amount of time when deciding, and my water was always full.  She is a fantastic waitress.  It makes all the difference.  Overall, it was a gorgeous afternoon.

"I really did not have a good experience with this company. Had to use it because it was the only company servicing my apartment complex. My husband called them on a Wednesday and they scheduled an appointment for the following Monday. Then on Monday, he gets a call that they are going to be late, arriving between 9pm-10pm. Guess what. No one showed. No calls or anything.  We waited a few days and called again. Got a busy signal every time. So I called the Orlando office and they transferred me. After waiting for 5 or so mins, someone picked up. He was nice enough. Explained to me that they had a huge system failure and lost a bunch of appointments and calls. Great. Still not sure why someone would call to say they were going to be late and then just not come.  Then when they finally came, they told us that we couldn't use our own modem or they would charge us more than if we used theirs. We got the receipt and looked at the price breakdown and it said that the internet was 28.04/m, plus 4.00/m for the modem. Also, they were charging 25.96/m for a phone that we didn't even want. We asked them to take it off, but they told us that we would get charged even more if we didn't use the phone. So, you are blatantly ripping us off?

"January 2015, I've just gotten back from Vegas and needed some food badly the next day. I pulled up to the ordering area, they took my order. I pulled up to pay. I waited there for six minutes for anyone to show.  Several employees walk by, I take out my phone and photograph the store number and call the customer care line. I left at 10 minutes, nobody had come to the window.  Mar 2015. I was out lateish. By old dad standards late, by anyone else's standards barely 10pm. Only the drive through is open. I got there and there were two cars in front of me to order and two past the ordering section. After several minutes of not moving the car at the ordering box takes off. I never heard anything except their horn as they left.  I placed my order, there were two cars in front of me. The car two up gets a small bag and two drinks. It's been there for a while. The next vehicle pulls up to pay. They're there for five minutes or so. There are now three cars behind me.  I pull up and the attendant looks back and says to another person that the line is backed up around the building and tells me it's another crazy night. There are a total of five people who get served during what I believe was a 20 minute wait. I turned my car off at one point because I was just idling for no reason.  Mar 2015 part 2. I went with a friend to the Armory, we had an hour before a lane opened up and we were hungry so this was it. Dry, low rent versions of otherwise meh food in the first place. Tortillas dryish, beans weren't mixed right, just amature hour. There were 4 other customers there, the place was somewhat wrecked - like it didn't need to be wrecked.  My order got through and to me, it was just not good. My friend's order showed up as I was starting on my last item.  Mar 2015 part 3. Wife went there, tells me she'd been craving TB like mad (this is another story,) but she decided she must want something else because she didn't like anything there. I tell her the story, it's that Taco Bell.  So overall in three personal experiences and one related the food has been of lower quality than the Metrocenter or Nolensville Road TBs I've been to. Service was way too slow every time I've been there.

I also enjoyed that this place was a bar after hours - if you came at 7:00 p.m., you could stay for a yummy dinner and then nosh on some apps and get some cocktails.  They had a pretty extensive cocktail, wine and beer list and there's ample seating for large parties.  I think there's more seating in the back, though I couldn't see it from my seat.    All in all, a pretty cool place to dine.  It's right at the corner of Market and 2nd Street, so you're right in the middle of all the action if you want to go out after.

"Don Juan is almost a weekly stop for us. Their tacos and green sauce combination is always so amazing!  You can't beat the price, convenience, and flavor here. My go to is always the pastor which comes with the occasional pineapple. If you're looking for a solid taqueria, come visit Don Juan!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
Very convenient location.  The customer service was great!  There weren't many cars available and we ended up getting an upgrade.  Would definitely use Enterprise and the Canal St location again.,Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 5.0
"This place is so good. Genuinely glad I had the chance to try it, will be back soon, hopefully! The food was fantastic and the people working were very nice and helpful for someone who didn't exactly know what to order or what was better. Can't wait to go back and try again. Glad they're opened up again!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"If you are driving down rt. 202 and you smell charcoal cooked meat, it's the Charcoal Pit.  For some reason, this place reminds me of the place Fred Flintsone would go for his brontosaurs burger.  The burgers and cheesesteaks are great.  I like my fries extra crispy and they always comply.  Try the triple thick shake...Yum!  This isn't gourmet dining, just great burgers, fries and shakes.  Give it a try!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"As a shopping maniac, I, of course, love DSW! I was super psyched to stumble upon this location on our visit to Jersey. They had a massive clearance section, which is my absolute favorite spot to shop, but the prices seemed quite a bit higher than they are where I live in Florida, which makes sense. The cost of living is much higher in Jersey. They had a great selection though. They also had a ton of accessories, jewelry and purses, much more that any other DSW I've seen. They just need a few more deep discounts. Bring on the 50% off, 70% off, and even 80% off stickers!",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 4.0
Friendly staff.  Clean room.  A little outdated but you cannot beat the price.  Hotwire saves you $100.00 off the actual price.  Definitely worth it.,Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 3.0

"We ordered the edamame, carpaccio, and tiger roll. It was a very busy night and we expected a wait for all of our food!! That was not the problem. We got the carpaccio and edamame after like 15 minutes but it took about 30 more minutes for the small tiger roll. We tried explaining to our server that we wanted to enjoy our meal together and she said that it takes extra time for the small tiger roll because of the shrimp tempura. The table next to us ordered at the same time and were served 6 rolls before we received all of our food. If that's all we ordered, we would have appreciated being told there would be a 30 minute extra for 1 roll. Both the server and the older woman that came to our table both laughed it off and barely apologized- like we should have known that it was going to happen. Just would have wanted a heads up.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
Standard fare but done consistently well.  The pizza is crisp and delicious.  Try the Tuna - its imported from Italy and really tasty,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

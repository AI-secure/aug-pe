"I am very bias when it comes to this Iron Hill location. First off, over the last year their bartenders have helped me learn what kinds of beers I di and do not like.They have gotten to know me and I them. It's borderline, my Cheers. In addition to beer, they do make good cocktails, but it's rare I get cocktails there.   I'd say if you can get there for happy hour that's your best time to go. They have a nice selection of appetizers for $5 and $7 and drink specials as well.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"I frequent this location when I visit my mom.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The food is always good.  I love the corn cake, you don't get that everywhere.  I read a review that was offended by the statue of a monkey at the checkout desk.  That monkey has always been here and makes me chuckle every time.  If you have a sense of humor then it isn't offensive.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"We love a good home made pasta dinner at home , this time we decided to try La casa pasta. You're greeted by the new owners Franco and Mara ( Franco e Mara son√≥ maravigliosi coppia italiana).The aroma and taste of fresh basil, tomatoes and good olive oil on the bruschetta gustoso , the lobster raviolis A+,  Mussels and conch over pasta was well prepared, the red sauce over spaghetti and meatballs was great. Fresh made dessert we had tiramisu,chocolate cake and cookies. We where in the right place and the right time! We can't wait to try the rest of the menu.

"I came in for happy hour and was one of the first customers in the door. I took a corner seat at the bar. The atmosphere was upscale but didn't feel stuffy. As the employees bustled around preparing for dinner service, I studied the cocktail menus (HH along with their standard drinks). Feeling slightly overwhelmed by what was in front of me I tried asking the bartender what drinks are popular/her favorite. I got a very vague explanation about the menu where she stated that all of the drinks were popular. This was not helping me to narrow down my search. I stared blankly at the menu for another five minutes and finally caught the attention of the other bartender who came over and was more than willing to explain everything cocktail on the menu to me in detail (trust me, I felt bad holding him up for that long, but I was very grateful). I narrowed my drink choices down and decided to get the 'Planet Caravan' as my first choice. It was a bourbon drink but perfect for me, as I am a new bourbon drinker. It was light and refreshing with just a tad of bourbon bite to it. I ordered a few dishes off the HH menu (today's toast, which was a red pepper spread topped with a chickpea salad and olives, and the maitake steak wit). I was very impressed with the food. The bread for both was very soft and I truly enjoyed my maitake cheese steak with a rutabaga based 'cheese' sauce.  For dessert I decided on another drink, even though the sticky toffee pudding was calling to me. I ordered the 'Apple Scruffs' which was wonderful. It was very festive and had a cinnamon/apple flavor with just a touch of citrus, giving my mouth a refreshed feeling. I overheard the bartender who had originally let me down with her drink explanation telling another guest that she had only started a week ago. So it's understandable to an extent that she was slightly awkward, but also shows a lack of training. When the other bartender was explaining the drinks to me, I hope she was listening carefully so that she will not have so much difficulty next time. Therefore, I give four stars to this review. The food and drinks here are lovely, but hopefully the rest of the staff are well versed in the menu.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Santa Barbara for a super low key bacholorette for me! Which meant a lot of eating, wine, walking round, and more eating! First stop was Tupelo though! And after the slightly long drive from LA, we were all definitely hungry and ready to eat!  A little bit of a wait since we didn't want to sit outside. Got a cute little seat inside after maybe 10-15 minutes. The place itself is very cute! Big blocky wooden chairs and a natural clay colored floor, with the brick and tan interior, and the black metal fencing, makes it feel like you're sitting in a courtyard somewhere. Sans plants and sunshine shining from above.   It just so happened that we all wanted the dungeness crab cakes, so we didn't have a lot of variety, but here's what I got to try.  BEIGNETS The beignets I've had before were light fluffy little balls of goodness, while these had the same shape I'd say they were so dense that I could barely eat one. They were extremely deep fried too which made the outside kinda hard. The sauce that came with it was delic...but of course if the beignet doesn't work...  DUNGENESS CRAB CAKE Yummy! If you eat a lot, then this definitely isn't the dish for you, but for a small girl this is just right. Plenty of crab in here and the hash is good too. Good balance of flavors.   Small lunch to get ready to explore the rest of SB and make sure there's room in our tummies for more goodness! Good place to stop by for brunch!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
Not impressed when you walk past me and don't say hello.  They did nothing to acknowledge us and it still took 5 minutes to get a menu.  The fried rice tasted was not good and my sushi was not deep fried and it wasn't hot.  I would go on but this getting to be drag just like the restaurant.

"I would give zero starts if could. Where to begin with this place? I will never again or do I recommend buying from this place. We ordered furniture May 2021 and was told everything will be in by July 13. We also paid for delivery and setup. Well nothing was in and was told end of July. We did get part of our items the end of July but all the other items every month they would tell us it was coming in at the end of the month. The items we did receive was 6 kitchen chairs with no table and every chair wobbled so we had to have a technician come out to fix them to find out that the people that made them forgot a piece that goes in the backs on the chairs so, we now had to order all the new backs for our chairs so who knows when they will come in. Then with the items they did bring us the delivery guys were very rude and didn't even put my stuff together we had to do it ourselves. Then we also got our dresser, nightstands and footboard and headboard but no rails  so I can't even put my bed together and they don't even have an estimate delivery date all they could tell me is it would be sometime after May 2022. That is over a year from when I ordered!!!!!!!!! I had finally talked to someone who told me my kitchen table and the other dresser we ordered was in and ready for delivery so we set up a date. The day before delivery they sent an email and txt that we were the second stop on the delivery. Well we set here all day Saturday and the delivery never showed up. I called to find out what happened and they told me that I wasn't even scheduled for a delivery so I read them each of the confirmation messages I had received. We then went to the store and they told us that they had removed my items from there delivery and didn't bother to inform anyone about it!! So I wasn't half a Saturday for nothing!!!! I have left complaints on all sights I can to let people know how horrible of a furniture place this is and they are NOT the number one furniture store and I highly recommend shopping other places",Business Category: Home & Garden,Review Stars: 1.0

When I walked in I was not greeted with a nice ""hello"", but with an emotionless and impolite ""you can just sit here"". The service was extremely slow and it took us forever to get our glasses of water, appetizer and sushi. I ordered tap water, and it was the grossest tasting tap water I've ever tasted. Also, during our dinner, it was difficult getting a hold of someone because I wanted to order tea. Every time an employee walked by, I tried to make eye contact or say something to them but I was simply ignored. Even though this is an overall negative review, their sushi seemed good. But, my review of their sushi probably is not too accurate since they drenched my sushi in brown sauce.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"This is my first review of a grocery store, and I am only doing it with the hope that the management reads it...  Overall, this Publix has a very good selection; however, they constantly discontinue items.  I could list a dozen items that they have inexplicably dropped, but I am reluctant to give away my dietary secrets...haha.   Ok - I will give up a few items:  Jalapeno Hummus; Mary Kitchen low-fat corned beef hash; Publix brand no-sugar added hot cocoa.  Each time, I've gone to the service desk to ask for the item; not once has it actually worked.    This store was not built to accommodate the huge influx of Westchase residents, but I will give them credit for doing some remodeling to maximize the space.  Tip: If you can, go on off hours: mid-morning or mid-afternoon weekly - IF your schedule allows; Saturday before 10 am; NOT Sunday.  Why?  They have a terrible stocking problem, and you will most assuredly walk away missing 3-5 items on your list: common items such as lettuce; basil; cilantro.   This has happened nearly every time we've gone on a Sunday.  Ok, let me leave with a positive and then a ding and recommendation to management:  Positive: great variety in all areas, including cheeses, meats and fish, produce, fresh pizza dough, International foods, ice creams, wine.  Very friendly staff - and all the baggers are very kind.  Ding: at least every other week we unpack and put our groceries away only to find THE NEXT DAY that some of the produce has mold or has gone bad.  This happens way too often!!  On the plus side, they NEVER hesitate to let us return it.  But I do think they really need to check the produce before placing it out.",Business Category: Grocery,Review Stars: 3.0

The bread that came out before the meal was pretty good and paired well with the bisque, but the flounder fell a bit flat in terms of flavor.  However, the fish was cooked well and makes me want to come back to try some of the other dishes before giving up on this place.  The dessert was only okay, but the carrot/spice cake was a bit better than I expected it to be.  I'll be back to try out the drinks - they looked pretty tasty! - and try something else for the menu to see if this place is worth all of the hype.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 2.0

I've always ordered the soup there because it's a bit of their specialty- but people i've taken have ordered other dishes and they never disappoint.

"To be fair this review is based on two separate occasions that I visited this salon (once for a gel manicure and the second time for a pedicure and gel manicure). During my first visit the nail tech was chatty and engaging, while also attentive to what she was doing. I liked the selection of gel colors (and regular colors for manicure and pedicures). However, 8 days after getting my nails done two of my nails began to chip. This was such a disappointment considering that I chose gel in hopes that my manicure would last at least two weeks. Also, to my unpleasant surprise they did not offer ANC/ powder manicures (which truly makes your manicures last). During my second time, the nail tech was not very engaging, but efficiently worked and did a great job with my pedicure. However, she appeared to rush with my manicure and spent half of the time chatting with another nail tech.

My personal experience with the food wasn't the best, but I can see why this place is considered a great Chinese place considering the only other options are Panda Express and the use-to-be Pick Up Stix that went out of business.  My friend and I had the onion pancake for an appetizer and ordered the salt and pepper pork and duck for entrees. The onion pancakes were okay... but it resembled the scallion pancakes that I would buy frozen from 99 Ranch and re-fry. Both the pork and duck were dry. This was a little disappointing since the place wasn't busy one bit - the workers were actually peeling the edges of green beans because of the lack of customers...

"NOTE TO CHRIS' PANCAKE AND DINING:  I remember your place from years ago and got a hankering to revisit.  Upon being seated (at the odd time of 3:30) me and the Hubs noticed a table of guys, high school aged and laughing, texting, etc. I'm guessing there was no school due to President's Day coming up on Monday? A four-day-weekend for the Facebook Generation?  Dainna was our waitress. She was very warm, great retro hair (no bumpit needed) and a bright, bright smile. She told us the specials...but we were not to be deterred. We knew what it was going to be.  Thick and Crunchy-Hot Onion Rings came with a side of 1,000 Island to plunge the Rings into. Yes, they have 1,000 Island. It's that kind of joint, a nod to the vintage...but obviously not try too hard. After Hubs bit into a ring he had to wipe the steam from his specs. They were THE LIVING END!  We also HAD to try your ""Toasted Ravs."" Let me explain something about Toasted Raviolis. St. Loiusans will not only fry everything...but we will also STUFF it full of cream cheese and THEN fry it. Joke I not. Think frozen Raviolis dipped in egg and pulled through highly seasoned breadcrumbs then deep-fried until a golden crisp. These Ravs? VERY VERY GOOD. The making of a good Rav can also be in the Marinara that is used for dunking. I was told the owners are generationally Italian---well, they produce a stunning Marinara!!  Looking up from our Asiago Cheese dusted Toasted Raviolis a second table (next to us) was soon occupied by four more high school dudes. They were having fun. THEY WERE BAKED!! Now we know what these area teens do/smoke on their day off from school. They ordered a massive tableful of hot and crispy Bar Food. ""...some more Ranch would be EXCELLENT!""  Hubs' Side Salad came. The Caesar Dressing that was on it is one of the best I've ever tasted. The Parmesan/Vinegar/Garlic in equal amounts KNOCKED me in the face. Sort of like that first drag you get when you take a big pull on a McDonald's Coke. Got it? REAL PIZAZZ. FULL TILT.  The rest of his meal came in the form of a charger which cradled a thickish cut of Prime Rib bathed in Au Jus, Baked Potato and Green Beans and Bacon. The shocker here, this magnificent, heroic plate...$15.99!! So I left the Hubs grinning while he lowered each Jus drenched bit of beef into the horseradish creme.  Next, my Omelet. A 3-Egg size length filled with Feta, Griddled Spinach and Onions. This was accompanied by a flat sofa of Crispy Lace Edged Hashbrowns and three Pancakes. The Omelet was perfectly cooked not tough. The Feta was like Greeky-Salt-Bombs in each bite and MY GOD...THE PANCAKES!! Malty, springy perfection. They took me back to my childhood visiting great diners now extinct.  I also noticed all of the other waitstaff and cooks and perhaps your manager (?) and how they interacted with one another. They were talking about how they all went out last week.

This place charges you for anything you order. If you are running a Korean BBQ that is not AYCE... The meat better be of high quality.... But this is not the case at this establishment. The sever dropped a piece of meat while delivering our food but never said sorry or refill the lost meat. Toally unacceptable when you pay by the order. I feel totally ripped off. He pretended like nothing happened... The steam egg was Burnt At the bottom so all we tasted was bitter.  This place is in business only because no REAL Korean BBQ is in Tucson.

"Casual and inviting, yet upscale and clean, everything about Binkley's says, to me: ""welcome, relax, and enjoy a caliber, but no-nonsense meal and drinks"".  The atmosphere is comfortable and relatively quiet. I noticed that, at least in the restaurant, the tables seemed relatively spread out -- avoiding the sensation of sitting in a crowded space. We didn't have to wait too long for a table either -- which was really nice.  Our server was very friendly, and really knowledgeable about the menu. I despise servers who always use ""It seems to be a really top seller"" as a euphemism for ""I don't know"", ""have never tried it"", or ""I just started here and have no idea what's even on our menu"".  Our food was delicious. Upscale, adult flavors, but not too pretentious.

I have one word for Lou's: Legit.  Like I said, I grew up on this mind blowing combo of bread, meat and delicious glory that we all know as a zep. Other menu items are top-notch too, such as their breakfast sandwiches, homefries, cheesefries, etc!

After 15 mins my friend got one of the girls attention and after another 10 mins she came over and got our drink order. She came back once in 45 mins. We sat down to eat and I watched 5 waitresses talk and socialize with their friends for 25 mins. I assume at least  2 to 3 of the girls worked on the restaurant side. At this point there were 8 customers in the place counting our 3. We gave up and as I paid for our 1 beer in almost 2 hours I told the head waitress we would have stayed if anyone would have served us. She apologized.

I quit going and they decided to go ahead and bill my credit card for $355 without my authorization.

I asked to speak to Dr. Sanford who was apparently too busy at the time to speak with me. I called several times and even asked if I could make an appointment to talk with him. Finally, I just decided to go down there. When I got there, he tells me he's working on payroll and doesn't have time to talk to me. I ask him why in the past 3 weeks he hasn't been able to find a time to talk to me. He then shouts (YES HE WAS LITERALLY SCREAMING) that I better leave his office immediately or he's going to have the receptionist call the police to escort me out.

This is my first time going to a Pho restaurant and from my first experience I would say that it won't be my last. My sister chose to go here on her birthday so it was new to us all. The service was great and very considerate when we had questions about the food and bulba tea options. Everything we ordered was very flavorful. I loved the pho but I also had the coconut curry that was delicious as well. We definitely be coming back her.....  Just an update. I would like to come back but based on my experience today I was sadly disappointed. I ordered the curry(don't know which one but a picture will be below). It wasn't my first  time ordering this and I was really looking forward to it. The bowl was hot and overflowing which was not the issue. It was when I stirred to the bottom an got a chunk of potato that I had to spit out because it was raw. I took out two more and they were also raw as well. When the waitress came by I told her about it and what happened next is what was really disappointing. She said I wish you would have said something earlier so we could have done something about it. It caught me off guard and it was like I had to  explain to her why I didn't because the potato's were at the bottom of the bowl. While I'm also thinking to myself why do I have to explain something that wasn't my fault? She then asked me if I would like it reheated and I said yes so she proceeds to take it away to do so. By the time I got it back my sister was done so I just asked for it to go. When I got the bill nothing was taken off for the inconvenience. One of the two waitresses apologized at least. But that's not all. When I brought it home to reheat the potatoes were still raw! Just supper disappointed.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

They did have some decent art supplies, but professional and aspiring artists would be better suited in going to the Art Supply store on Central Ave.   Whim-So-Doodle is basically like the scrapbooking section of Michaels, only a heck of a lot larger.

I wanted a change, but everything I researched online said my hair wasn't a good candidate. Because I am either stubborn or in denial of the truth, I still decided to walk-in for a consultation. I met with Laura and she confirmed what I had already known, my hair wasn't a good candidate and the perm would barely take. She let me know that it would be wavy at best, she was very upfront. She walked me through what the process would be and I decided to go for it. Worst case scenario, it would still be lifeless. We made an appointment for the following week.   Fast forward a week--The receptionist instantly knew I was the perm upon walking in and was very excited for me. The process itself was easy, they offered a glass of wine and happy banter while I waited. I can't say I was nervous, but it was definitely a big change. When all was said and done, both Laura and I were excited to see the perm did cause nice beach waves. She was very thorough when teaching me how to take care and maintain everything.

"You are still the one!   We had dinner at this wonderful place on a Sunday night. We got a table by the window. What a view: Winter evening, snowflakes slowly dancing, the Truckee River flowing, and the decorative lawn lights glowing.   We started with cocktails. For me a French 75 a la Beaujolais that smelled and tasted delicious. Bourbon for him. We took our time sipping our drinks and going over the menu, enjoying the cozy atmosphere, the fireplace and the music. It is hard to make one's mind with so many options. We finally decided to go for the degustation menu that consisted of four courses plus dessert, and wine pairing. Every single dish was delicious, and the pairing enhanced them even more.   The staff is very knowledgeable and the service was on point. Li, our waiter, made pleasant conversation, filled us in with some details about the dishes and made sure that the courses kept flowing. We could see him discreetly hovering around our table, ready to fulfill any requests. Every dish was delivered at the right time, along with the wine. Water glasses and bread basket refilled as needed.  Excellent experience. Definitely coming back for more!  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Ooh, la la! This place is beautiful, the atmosphere is very romantic, the food is delicious and the service is flawless.   We had a reservation for a table by the window because I am head over heels about this area of town and wanted to enjoy the view.  We were there early and sat at the bar to wait for our table. The kitchen is right behind the bar and watching the food preparation was highly entertaining so we decided to have dinner at the bar and move to a table for dessert. The hostess was very gracious and willing to fulfill our requests.   We enjoyed watching the chef and his team. They had their face game on, they seemed very focus, were perfectly synchronized, barely spoke but made magic happen.   We had butter squash soup, Liberty duck breast with cherry sauce and roasted vegetables, and creme brule. The soup was a velvety winter warmer, the duck was crispy and juicy, the vegetables were sweet and firm and dessert was light as a feather.   I understand that the menu changes daily to take advantage of seasonal products.   It was a Friday night and there was a nice mix of patrons: families, couples, groups of friends. The atmosphere was casual, yet intimate and romantic.   The restaurant, a mix of traditional and modern, is a charming bungalow with large windows overlooking the river. The exposed bricks, metal structures, and contemporary lighting fixtures make the interior feel modern.   I can't wait for the Summer and have the opportunity to enjoy their beautiful outdoor seating while sipping a glass of wine and admiring the beautiful surroundings.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
For being a pet friendly hotel they have no area for pets. The lady at the desk told us we could take our dog to the park that was a few miles away to use the restroom.

"Although the food was delicious, the service was close to unforgivable. The waitress, albeit admittedly new, served us appetizers and our salads before our drinks even came and let them sit at the bar even after being asked where our drinks were. She would forget to get forks or straws and forgot to bring one of our appetizers. The manager was made aware of this and said he would take care of our drinks. When the bill came ( which had no problem arriving fast), the appetizer we never got was on the bill and when we mentioned it, she said she had brought it to us. We said no. She then shrugged and said ok. The manager then came over and said we had stated one appetizer had not come but the waitress is saying it was brought over ( what manager does this????). We again stated we never got it and with everything being so slow and wrong, we didn't bother to ask for it, assuming she had forgotten to order it.  I will say the bartender who saw what was happening during our dinner, came to expedite everything  and would get the drinks to us and even the food as the waitress clearly was not capable.  Unfortunately a remarkable bad service experience will ruin any good food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Forgot to leave a review about this restaurant, had lunch here with the family last Sunday, was pleased with our first visit!  Started out with the garlic knuckles which were awesome! Got a 20"" sausage and pepperoni pizza was huge and very tasty!  The service wasn't the worst but wasn't the best either. Our waitress passed our table a lot never asking if we needed refills which we did, I know they were busy but do your job. For the most part our waitress did an okay job.  All in all I'd definitely come back here, the knuckles and pizza were great! I recommend this restaurant if you've not tried them yet!",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 4.0

"The ambiance was so so. I liked that they seated various groups of men towards the bar and everyone else a lil bit away so they weren't disruptive. Our servers were great and very attentive. We were celebrating my sister's birthday and they made sure to wish her a happy birthday and went about everything very nicely. I love places that put my napkin in my lap for me, that's just me though.  We shared the crab cake to start. It was made with lots of crabmeat which is great. However, there was WAY too much lemon flavor which made the crab cake sour. And we prefer our crab cakes to be more packed together, this one literally fell apart like a pile of crabmeat vs a crab cake.  We both had the petite filet cooked medium. We loved that is had a crust to it. The steak was seasoned perfectly and cooked the way we requested.  The potatoes at gratin were cooked well and super duper cheesy.  I was told Freddie Mac and cheese were alright, nothing special.  The creme br√ªl√©e was yummy. The torched sugar was just right, not too much like some places. The candle was a nice touch.  UPDATE: I went back again last night and everything was equally great! If you valet, they charge you $5 to your bill.   We tried the Braised Pork Belly for the appetizer. It wasn't what I was expecting but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The pork fell apart and was very very tender. The seasoning was a little bit lacking in my opinion but if you like pork belly it's worth a try.  We had the onion rings tonight, they were a lil bit sour for our taste but very thin and crispy. An order is very large and could easily be shared among 4 people. There were 2 of us and we only ate about half of it, if that.  My SO had the ribeye and loved it.   We also had the lobster..... OMG... It was AMAZING. I've had a fair amount of lobsters in my life, but this was the first time it was PERFECT. Literally everything you could ever want it to be. It was cooked to perfection and the seasoning was just right. Seriously, if you've wanted to try lobster and haven't, try it here. If you have had bad experiences with lobster before, try this one.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 5.0

"Han Dynasty is everything I want in a Chinese restaurant. It is convenient. I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table (even for a large group) or more than 20 for my food after ordering. It is diverse. I know I can go the more adventurous route with some of their more authentic dishes (which focus predominantly on Szechuan cuisine but include also some Taiwanese and Hunan style dishes) , but I can also guiltily order my scallion pancakes and sweet and sour chicken if I want to. It is generous. Portions are family style, bottomless rice is included and tea! This makes for a very happy me.  For a first timer, I would recommend going in a large group and getting the tasting menu. Set your preferred spice level and inform your waiter of dietary restrictions and preferences- they will do the rest. You get a ton of food for a great price and to try dishes you might not otherwise have ordered (Shrimp with Honey and Walnuts?). Have a good time with your friends and go home stuffed! My favorite dishes include the cucumbers in chili oil, Three Cup Chicken, Eggplant with Garlic, Scallion Style anything, and the cold sesame noodles. See too many things you want to order? Go for it.

I recommend Hair by Mattie. She takes time to understand what you want. In my case she explained that she could do it but it would damage my hair.

Instead she blended my hair so I have no harsh transitioning  and I can go gray the natural way without chopping it off.

"We waited 1.5 hours to be sat and once we got settled in, the server told us that it is required that we each order an entree. This was upsetting because there were 4 of us in which 2 of us had literally just spent $200 a couple hours prior on dinner and the other 2 people hadn't ate at all. So the 2 of us who already ate,  planned on getting a little snack and some wine. Not spending $50 on entrees that we won't eat because we're stuffed. When my sister politely told them they should at least tell people that before making people wait an hour and a 1/2 they said that they purposely don't tell people because it would derail them from wanting to eat there possibly. SERIOUSLY?!?! Worst customer service ever! Who says that?! The hostess who sat us was very rude also. The WHOLE time I was eating, the AC vents were dripping on me and in my food!

"This was my first time staying in Santa Barbara and I wasn't sure where to stay or what to do. I came across this place and it looked fun an cute so I booked. It was a little pricey at $130 for a small room but the there was a ton of parking, the room was small but really cute. It didn't feel like you were in a hotel. The room reminded me of staying at a friends house with its clean and simple Ikea furniture and high ceilings. There were free bikes to ride and it was right at the top of State street so it was really easy to get to shopping and food easy. The staff at the front desk were very helpful in telling us where to go and what to see. Even drawing it out on a map for us. The only down side was not having a fridge in the room but other than that it was perfect. We liked the room so much we went out for dinner and got our desert to go so we could lay in bed and watch TV. We would definitely come back again.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 5.0
"This is one of the friendliest and most honest electronics store I have ever had the pleasure of using. AT&T improperly pushed in my Sim card in my iPhone and apparently bent the housing and the Sim card itself slightly. TAZ opened my phone and simply bent the Sim card and housing back making the phone work. They did not charge me a diagnostic fee or any amount for the service.  I requested to at least pay something given they fixed the phone. I believe it was the owner that was extremely friendly saying they did such minimal work, they would be no charge and simply wished me a Merry Christmas. TAZ could have told me anything and probably charged me any amount, and I would not have known better.  This phone was a Christmas gift for my daughter and the most important thing was to have it working.

I was not expecting much being in the french quarter but they sure delivered more than they promised. It is a very pack place and now I could see why. They offered very New Orleans inspired meals that fits for my vacation. I ordered the banana foster french toast and it was impeccable. I sure tasted that bourbon with the banana. I convinced my husband to get the conchin egg Benedict and the pork meat was savory and tender. Plus he asked for extra Holendaise sauce but it was done perfectly. Then I tried the biscuit with egg Benedict and I was so soft and delicious. I would tell you that breakfast here would guarantee a memorable meal that make you want to come back for more.

I ordered some coffee and asked if they would have any Dark Roast available. The guy behind the counter said no that they stop making it at night. I didn't understand that or why they don't make pastries later on at night either.  I will say that the people are courteous and nice, my problem is the food and the way they do things with their coffee and pastries.They have the word Bakery in the title of their company, you would think they would focus more on that aspect.

They have a great cocktail list, and wine menu, but they also have great bartenders. One of my favorite cocktails is an aviation, which most bartenders don't know how to make, or are their bars don't have the right ingredients. I have had some of the best aviations ever at the salt house!! Lastly, dessert. I'm one of those people who doesn't really want dessert unless it's exceptional. I really can't tell you which dessert at the salt house I like better, the chocolate torte or the bread pudding. SERIOUSLY, leave room for dessert! I really don't know how on earth the small kitchen at the salt house puts out the amazing food they do! Fair warning, make a reservation because this adorable restaurant is small.

"Nestled away on St. Claude, in a small, unassuming building that looks a little bit like a strip mall is Reds. I stopped in to drop off a brochure, and was hypnotized by the fragrant scent of garlic and magic. Despite saving Chinese food, in general for the absolute worst of my hangovers, I immediately dialed up my husband to join me for lunch.  Don't be discouraged by the lack of flash on the outside. The inside decor is clean, modern and tastefully decorated.  All three of the crew on staff was helpful, engaging, and overall awesome.  I sat at the bar, contemplating my cocktail of choice, when the bartender suggested I sample the daiquiri of the day, made fresh daily. Yesterday was some sort of green tea/honey concoction... It was amazing for a balmy afternoon in July.  The bartender made some suggestions for us, and after some heated debating we decided to try the kung pao pastrami and the pork belly bun. We also sampled a some sides: the creamy cucumber salad was hands down our favorite, but the kimchi and pickles n cauliflower side were excellent as well. The pork bun was delicious, with a hefty piece of crispy pork belly tucked away with a siracha sauce. The pastrami dish was wildly different than I could have imagined.... Big chunks of tender pastrami, fresh veggies, tossed in a chili sauce with some crazy flat rice noodles. It was amazing. Despite splitting the entree, we are still picking at it today. Just when the food situation could not get in more intense, the owner, Red, sent out a couple egg rolls. Yum. Will we be back? You bet your sweet ass we will. Should you check it out? Definitely.  Before writing this review I read some of the bad ones. Extra giggles to the lady who said the decor scared her kid, and the guy who ""flipped out at his SO"" because he didn't like the food, she suggested it, and as a result of his temper tantrum, he didn't get laid.

"Three trips there in the past week and will be back for more.  Hefty burrito with a large choice off adds.  Barbacoa was good, but I'm definitely a carne azada guy.  Their barbacoa is not cheek meat, though, in case you are a South Texan looking for that authentic Tex-Mex fave.  Manager said he was from Veracruz which has a different barbacoa tradition (makes sense - on a trip to Baja they looked at me like I was gonzo asking for cheek meat.)  Nice to have a choice between black beans and pintos, though would prefer frijoles.  Tamales are firm, not fluffy so I'm thinking they're using real manteca.  Larger than the ones we make during our annual Christmas tamalada, so it could be a meal in itself.  Place is definitely busy during the lunch period when we've been.

"Never had a bad visit here once we get seated. On busy days, the wait can be over an hour because the restaurant sits on one of the busier intersections of the south side and the retail center of this part of Indy/Greenwood. So beware if you're visiting on a big holiday or event weekend - you're in for a wait.  Once you're inside though, service has always been great. The menu is massive, portion sizes are massive, and yeah the prices can be pretty massive too - so prepare your wallet.  But of course the highlight is the namesake cheesecake - you'll need to take out a second mortgage to try every flavor, but everything I've tried I've loved. (But the Red Velvet is *chef's kiss.*)  Also the bread - I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about the bread. My kids call the brown bread ""chocolate bread"" because it's so delicious, and honestly I can't argue.  My only real complaint - I don't know if they just want to keep their electric bill low, but this place is DARK when the sun goes down. I mean I saw more than one table using their cell phone to check their meat to see if it was done.

"Remember in Gladiator when Maximus would teater the line between life and death and would be walking through the fields of Elysium? I too have had these moments but instead of life and death the line I walked was between sober and drunk and instead of Elysium I would be walking through a giant sports bar completely dedicated to Philadelphia teams.   So when I arrived at Xfinity Live Saturday for the Flyers Phillies back to back there was something eerily familiar about this place that I had only seen in my subconcious.   I called on Thursday to reserve a booth which was a huge move as the place was pretty packed. To reserve a booth you have to spend $240 which I did not see being a problem considering the amount of time we would be staying there. The booth was in the dead center of the NBC Sports Arena and to be completely honest, it is a very close second to actually being at the game.  It's extremely loud, complete with a regulation sounding goal horn, and the Flyers after goal song. I actually lost my voice from yelling the entire game. The only thing that I found weird was that they don't have beer menus and they don't offer pitchers or beer towers. Besides that it was all good, the food was decent and they had Hop Devil on tap.  It's not cheap and we definitely surpassed the $240 minimum but everyone had such a good time it was more than worth it.

"We had ONE night in Nashville and chose Caney Fork because it wasn't a chain and had a good variety of food, & frog legs (yum!).   FAIL!!!  Our waiter was more then inattentive. He was apparently more worried about his new phone's internet not working and sitting in the back or following around another man who was clearly either the manager or owner.   The corn fritters were by far the best part of our experience!! My boyfriend and I each ordered a beer. They were OUT of frog legs, so we went with crab cakes and gator tail. Our apps were delivered by a waitress- the gator was good and the crave cakes were... strange to say the least. Our waiter came a few minutes later after I had set an empty beer bottle on the edge of the table. The waiter proceeded to ask if my bf wanted another beer and he said he'd like some water and the waiter said okay and walked off as I also asked for water. Our food was delivered and it was worse then school cafeteria food.   I had the grilled shrimp with green beans and fried okra. Shrimp was lightly seasoned and had a rubbery taste with little flavor, probably frozen. The green beans were under cooked as was the fried okra. I left about 75% if my plate.  Boyfriend ordered the catfish dinner with campfire potatoes and baked beans. The catfish was breaded exactly as the okra, gator, and crab cakes were and had absolutely no flavor at all. It was clear that the catfish was frozen. The baked beans and potatoes were okay but nothing to rave about. He left about 75% of his plate (see pic).   For people who usually tip 40-50%,  my boyfriend really did not want to tip the waiter. $65 tab, ended up with a $4 tip! :( The food was in no way the waiters fault, however his inattentiveness to us as his ONE AND ONLY TABLE granted him a $4 tip!",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 1.0

"This place is okay. I got the regular beef burger w/ pepperjack cheese and sweet potato fries. It was good, but not the greatest. We just wanted something to fill us up before we went out so this place worked fine. A little pricey for a burger and fries (~$14)...I like the booths though..comfy! I must add that our wait was ridiculous..like 40 minutes it seemed. I know that isn't THAT long, but when only two people are in front of you, it seems a tad lengthy. I also had the pleasure of a regular gambler stare me down multiple times while the hostess told him to stop being weird and go away..haha!

I placed an order here a while ago for delivery and they forgot my onions on my salad. I called back and the manager hung up on me and refused to redeliver the correct salad. I came into the location for a refund and had to argue with the manager to get my money back! I used my reward last night for my free pizza for a carryout as this was the only location still opened. The other manager there refused to let me pick up my food and said she would only deliver to my old address. I said okay well deliver it there and I will meet driver. Then she said she couldn't deliver my food. Manager Neil tried to make it better and said come today to get my food and he will make it... I get up here and the same piece of shit manager from before refused to make my food because of his original mistake!! Their store owner Tony Martin sent me an email for a free pizza as well and this disrespectful ass manager will not honor it! I will not get IMOS anymore!! Horrible customer service!!!!!

"BJ's is always solid. They have good food, a spacious atmosphere, and plenty of TVs for football season.  My wife and I both got the Thursday rib special--a half rack, two sides, a salad, and a pizookie (this cookie thing with ice cream that's pretty awesome) for 13.99 each. The ribs were tender, the house salad dressing was unique, and the white cheddar mashed potatoes are almost as good as my wife's homemade potatoes. We each got a BJs beer too. This was the only subpar part of our experience. My wife's blonde was ""a little off"" according to her (though she said she would have got another one--typical), and my Hopstorm IPA tasted more like a Hefeweizen.   This place has a huge dining soace with tall ceilings, and the bar area is open seating. Our server, Sean, was a nice guy. He seemed down to earth and genuine, and he got us everything in good time.   Minus the somewhat funky beer (I've had the red before and it's good; it'll be my choice next time), this place is a great choice for a date night, family dinner, or a few drinks and the game.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"You win Skinny & Co, I'm hooked on your facial oil!   I have very sensitive skin and practically everything I use on my face I have to be very careful about using in hopes to avoid breaking out into a pimply abyss. This product is 100% all natural, 100% effective, 100% legit! The ingredients - raw coconut oil & two essential oils...that's it. For someone that has very sensitive skin and must avoid anything with additives this is actually the best product I could use on my skin.  My one regret is waiting so long to give it a try because I was afraid of a greasy face and breakouts.

"The restaurant is very bright, looked clean, and there seemed to be plenty of waitstaff present.  We love Greek diner food, so we anticipated a positive experience.  The menu options were average.  The Greek salad I ordered was just meh - mostly iceberg lettuce, a few chopped green peppers and onions and a half of a winter tomato.  There was only one dolma included.  The feta cheese was tasty, but if a Greek restaurant is capable of only a sub-standard Greek salad then I won't be back to try anything else.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Just returned from an anniversary weekend to Old City, Philly. Found reviews for this restaurant and thought it had what my wife and I liked. This place lived up to, and exceeded the posted reviews. We arrived 15 min early for res, so we took a seat at the bar. Very personable bartender. Our table was ready in short order. We were seated and tended to immediately. We started with a crab spread and toast. Delicious! Not too salty, very creamy, and the crab was fresh. My wife ordered scallops over risotto. Tender, mild scallops without any of the iodine taste evident in many scallop dishes. I had the veal saltimbocca. Tender filets with prosciutto, cheese and diced tomato. A wine demiglaze topped it off. Tasty, and properly balanced accompanied by whipped potatoes. A very well done dish. We enjoyed a side of broccoli rabe with red peppers. Fresh, vibrant, and not bitter. For dessert, which we took to go, we had a creamy cannoli, and said my wife, ""the best tiramisu I've ever tasted."" The staff were professional, courteous, and properly attentive. Whenever we make a return trip to Philly, we will revisit this fine spot to sample more of the menu. If only they offered a sample plate.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"I wasn't impressed by El Rey's food, although the service was great and I like their improvised seedy-but-trying-to-pass-as-family-style vibe (really, I don't mean that sarcastically.)  Despite the mediocre quality of the food, I remember El Rey fondly - probably because the people who work there seem really nice, and because they gave me a chance to practice my Spanish listening skills.  And because I got to witness an aging biker dude showing off for a biker chick by insisting over and over again that the staff of El Rey needed to make him an oversized margarita.    If you're looking for fine Mexican food, don't come to El Rey.  The soup I ordered was good and spicy, but the shrimp tasted like it was straight out of the freezer, and the avocado wasn't ripe.  My friend said his fajitas tasted fine, but the ingredients weren't the best in terms of quality.  However, if you're looking for a quirky, memorable dining experience, stop by El Rey for some good people watching, or to escape the corporate chaos of 2nd Ave N.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Went to St. George's Greek festival in Indianapolis months back. Bid $50 for a hair cut by joe Patterson here at strandz. Probably would've behooved me to check out reviews first,but sadly  I didn't.  And sadly I won (Bc I was the only bidon this one.now I know why) sadly....I got duped.  I realized there was a 6 month expiration date on it ONLY after it was expired (2 wks to be exact)  My mistake to assume an auction item is good forever seeing as how I paid for it and seeing as how gift cards never expire from the store on the same premise.  I called joe three times. Each time with a descriptive message. No returned call.  The fourth time he answered. Unapologetically he stated he would not grant the auction item of a free (not so free) haircut. He stated he hates when people try to use gift cards 3-4 yrs down the road so he ""has to implement his rules regardless"" even though mine only expired two weeks ago.  Laughing I clarified to him that it ONLY benefits him to have a change of heart and redeem Bc he might earn a new loyal client plus he gets the 20% tip.  Wouldn't budge. So I've mailed the gift card back to St. George's with an informative letter of the happenings. I will put reviews everywhere I can to let people know.  I mean this guy obviously doesn't have a huge following if he has to do Groupon. That's always a BAAAAAD sign.  Learned my lesson.

"I went to Bibou on a Saturday night and both of us sat at the bar. The experience was incredible. We were somewhat intrigued by the change of style/menu revamp and decided to give it a try; boy, were we right.  All courses were incredible and you can tell that the integrity of the menu and how it evolved throughout the dinner was perfectly thought out. It was crescendo. Every plate was exceptional and being able to sit at the bar and seeing the kitchen is an entire story in itself. Highlights of the meal were the ""foie gras"", ""duck a l'orange with a lavender polenta"" as well the chef's version of a surf and turf with lobster and ox tail-DELICIOUS. The dessert souffle was also OUT OF THIS WORLD.  The service was also excellent, servers we're incredibly discrete and managed our 2 bottles perfectly letting us know what wines we should pair with what courses.  Already looking forward to our next visit, this was definitely one of the best meals of my life! Thank you Chef Pierre!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"I went to this restaurant earlier today for lunch with a client and friend of my company. I had been there about one month prior for lunch at the recommendation of another client and it was better, although not great. During my first visit I had the marghareta pizza which was pretty good. However today's lunch was not good and I felt compelled to share my experience so others do not potentially get sick and this problem can be addressed by the management and cooking staff of Cafe Cibo.  First, the bread was stale and cold when we arrived (apparently the bread and dipping sauce is their claim to fame). When the salads arrived they were warm and not long after the salads were delivered the entrees were delivered. I selected to Pollo alla Griglia and the person I was with selected the manicotti. As for my meal it was less than impressive. I would have eaten because I would not want to be rude to my guest but it was relatively flavorless and was looked far from appetizing. My guest ordered the manicotti and this is the reason I am writing the review. After the fork and knife went in to cut the first bite we both noticed an alarming color from the meal....green...a dark MOLDY green. He picked out multiple pieces of the pasta shell with mold spores that had grown and the spores were very noticeable indicating they had been growing for some time. A waitress was walking by, although she was not tending to our table and we informed her about our findings and asked her what that looked like. She did not acknowledge that it looked like mold but she did say, ""not good"". We sat at the table for another 1-2 minutes and we were not approached by management or a Chef to apologize for the potential health hazard they just served us. When we got up to walk out our waiter just waved his hand at us and said, ""You're good."" No apology or anything. To be honest it appeared as though the wait staff knew their restaurant was unsanitary because they would not look us in the eye and had their heads down.  For the previous posts mentioning the restaurant being nice it is actually dated and pretty rough. Look at the ceiling, it is in terrible shape, the place has a odd odor that does not smell like a clean well kept restaurant. I hope management reads this and addresses these serious concerns.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 1.0

"Friend and I got super lucky for the Yelp Spring Break event to land this little gem. I think I am reiterating the fact that the location is awesome! It's basically one block from Bourbon Street and I feel like you're in the middle of everything in terms of walking distance. Basically, most things in the French Quarter are in walking distance.   The staff was really friendly and they have a complimentary breakfast in the morning. You have to go in the back through the little pool area and round the corner to the Fitness Center that's beside it. You can help yourself to the boiled eggs, mini cereal boxes, orange juice, cranberry juice, sausage patties, mini muffins, and yogurt. They allow you to take it back to your room as they provided styrofoam plates and plastic utensils.   We were super fortunate to be upgraded to balcony room because we tacked on an extra night and they still honored the yelp rate even though it was technically beyond that. Talk about hook up! Saved ourselves an extra $100 for Sunday night. Rooms were cleaned everyday.  The bedding felt clean! I hate that feeling when they have an old comforter. Yuck.  I seriously love the balcony for the room.  You share it with other patrons as well. I love the balconies/galleries on the French Quarter structures. Oh be warned, it's still really loud at night. I can't imagine how it's like on Bourbon Street. Actually, it's probably not best to stay on Bourbon Street itself if you want sleep.

"Ah, Amrita Yoga.. grab some tissues because it's about to get sappy.  This studio is really where I started my yoga practice. Our love affair began with a mild interest, to okay this is pretty great, to (at one dark point in my life) being the only thing that could push me through some days. You hear all of these accounts where people really found themselves or were brought to inner peace, but you don't really know that to be true until you start to see some sprinkle of light from your uber depressed tunnel. I definitely partially have this beautiful space and amazing practice armed with phenomenal instructors to thank for pulling me out of absolute hopelessness and back to me.  Fast forward. I've taken so many classes that I've loved - Amrita Flow Level 1/2/3, Yinyasa, Infrared Hot Flow, meditation work shops, I even tried this kind of bizarre Capoiera class.. but what I've really fallen in love with is Elevate. Oh my god. It is so challenging that I hardly believed I made it through the first one-hour sweat session. But I did, and I was sore for days, and it was wonderful. The entire experience is just, honest gold. Natasha, this amazingly sweet, absolute godess must have previously studied psychology or something of the sort. If her enviable bod alone isn't enough to motivate you- don't worry, the super dancy tunes, her ability to get you out of your head, and the freedom of being able to move in your own way at times, but then having absolute structure when you need it to keep pushing will get you to push yourself til the end, I promise. Feeling the strength build in your glutes, arms and legs, along with the overall ""funness"" of the class is what will keep you coming back. Also, I always love an instructor who won't guilt you for going into child's pose if you need a sec, in fact, she's so receptive that sometimes you find yourself moving into it and next thing you know she'll go ""let's take a couple of breaths in child's pose."" I look forward to this class every week, and I have dragged along several friends who were hesitant as all hell when I told them about the two to three days of soreness, but then they became absolutely addicted as well.  My only complaint, or critique rather, is that - don't get me wrong I love that I am able to attend at least once a week, and I would quite possibly cry if the days/times changed, but I can say confidently that if more people knew about this class, there would be a bigger turnout. Perhaps Elevate should also be held one day on the weekend, even every other week (?) because come on, I know for a fact there are more people working in either the restaurant industry or working from home that once they got a taste of this class they would make it work and get out to the weekday classes too. Trust me, get out of your computer chairs, wander down to Amrita and give this class a try, nothing will feed your body or mind more than Elevate over the course of an hour.

AC works great if but a bit noisy( they usually are). Sure, the place is funky, a bit shabby and things are not perfect. But I do not require a flat panel tv, modern and hip furnishings, nor a meticulously kept space.      There is no pool, Internet connection is through a cable, but it is free. I need my hotel room to only be a place where I change, recharge and watch a bit of tv. The Whitney fits the bill.

I was so impressed with this curry dish full of seasonal & even heirloom veggies, I had to thank the chef personally! I certainly hope you seriously consider adding this vegan dish to your regular menu because Chef Steven hit it out of the park! I loved the homemade salad dressing and the purple potatoes in the curry were a perfect addition! Oh and let's not forget those chocolate covered strawberries with coconut cream & walnuts for dessert....THANK YOU!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
I stopped in here 2 days ago for lunch with my husband after eating at a Soul Food place in Orlando that was to die for.   Pros:  Very nice looking establishment. Clean and decorated nice. (Not your typical hole in the wall joint). Small salad bar included w/your meal featuring fresh fruit. Very personable owner...Mama came around to each table to introduce herself.  Con:  Fried chicken was salty and not cooked thoroughly. Several pink spots near the bone. One of the servers kept sticking her head up under the food window to talk to the cooks while someone's plate was up. Furthermore she had no hair net. (Mama may want to train/retrain the food handling staff on food safety). Another server seen scratching her hair and wiping sweat from her face with her bare hands while waiting to pick up her customer's plate from the warming station window.  It doesn't help that the area where food is plated is visible to the customers.  All in all not to bad. Average at best. I will probably give Mama's another try as I want to see her business succeed.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Whenever I go to Santa Barbara, Olio e Limone is a MUST!! I am The Italian Food Snob, and I lead annual Exclusive & Unique Food Tours in Italy. I am VERY picky when it comes to Italian food, and this restaurant is TOP! It does not get any better than this.  Whether I go to Olio e Limone or the pizzeria next door, the food is exquisite. I am never disappointed. I love the menu selection, the wine selection (try some of the Sicilian wines- TO DIE FOR!!!) and the desserts are homemade (my favorite desserts!!!).  The pastas are cooked to perfection and chef Morello ensures an authentic Italian experience.   Basically, you won't find american concoctions here. It's the real deal. Unfortunately, when it's the real deal, you find bad reviews, from people that do not deserve to eat at this extraordinary establishment. They deserve to eat at the Olive Garden or Maggiano's or any other place that serves that type of food (NOT Italian).  So take it from a real food critic.

"Came here a little hesitant because of the fairly high price for the tacos when there's other places that sell them cheaper so I told myself I would be stern on them in this review. And they passed the test. The tacos were delicious. Your best bet is to get the Combo Cartel which lets you mix and match three tacos, along with fries & melted cheese, and charro beans. For $15, that's actually pretty good bang for your buck. The fried fish and fried shrimp tacos were awesome. The aioli they cover both with was so good. The carne asada taco was ok but that's my fault because I'm a picky eater and basically got everything off the taco but the steak lol. I would like to go back and try the other tacos because if they were as good as the shrimp and fish then my stomach is already craving it. The beans were really good too. They should probably offer you a spoon for that though (they only give a fork and knife). The fries were decent. The melted cheese on them dries up pretty quickly. But if you eat them fresh, they're much better. Service here was exceptional. The manager of the store came by multiple times to make sure all was good. She was very sweet. We also had a male server who was really nice and informed us that a ""refill"" of the salsa and chips would have been more which was very nice of him to let us know before just surprising us with the charge on the bill. I do think they do not offer enough salsa with the chips though. But it's free so I guess you can't complain too much. My only other slight gripe is the cups are small. Fancy, but small. So you will likely be constantly needing refills if you drink a lot with your food like I do. However, me and my date only had water so I do not know if they offer larger cups if you get a fountain drink. The inside was beautiful. Great ambiance and perfect for date nights. All servers had masks and soon as a party would leave they would sprint to the table to clean it. Was pretty funny to see haha. Taco Del Cartel left a good impression on me and I will certainly be back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Apparently I need to get out of East Nashville more. Germantown is super cool and quaint. I dig.  Took me a minute to find Steadfast after parking further away than I needed to. Once I was in, I instantly liked the layout of the place. There were a couple guys in front of me taking their sweet time with questions about origins and all that fancy stuff. I respect this but I want my dang latte! At least a chance to look at the menu while I wait. (More menus need to be on the walls, what's with this menu you have to grab right at the point of sale. Cut down on trees and hassle!) The menu itself seemed confusing as far as coffee goes (hence questions from patrons in front of me?) but the gentleman and I got talking and I asked for a latte. He asked if I wanted it sweetened and gave me a few options as to how they could do that. Butterscotch? Yes please.  I grabbed a seat at a table and whipped out my book and notepad. The music was blasting (yes Supertramp!) but I could barely focus. I don't know if this place is great for reading but there were several people with laptops working away. I guess headphones could be of help. There were also several people who appeared to work there gathered at a table next to me. They seemed like great people but they were super loud being right next to me and being I had my book out. Seems like they could have lowered their voices, stepped to the back, or something to make a guests experience better. (Maybe I am being too needy) Overall I really liked this place and will definitely be back! The gentleman who helped me out seemed like the guy in charge- and he was super friendly. I would expect more from his staff though, he was doing work while they were sitting next to me talking. But hey, who am I to judge.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Come on a Thursday and you will see an interesting mix for sure if a DJ or group is next door.  I stuffed myself when I was there too.  Had was the Lobster Rangoon (not your fast food Chinese style for sure, excellent), Atomic Rice Bowl with chicken, black beans, veggies and Mexican rice (rice might have been a bit dry but I would order this again for sure),  and I topped if off with a huge slice of mud pie (I didn't ask for a huge one, it came that way) that I could not finish.  That was a bit hard to eat because the crust was so frozen but I managed and it was very good.  There were other various dishes among our party which everyone seem to enjoy such as the Fried Plantains, Wagon Wheel and Pepper Jack Cheese Bites (heavy on the wagon wheels, peppers), cheese quesadillas but the real star of the night was the waiter, Marti, he has the perfect personality for this work.  He was super busy and while you could tell he was, he still managed to take care of everything in a timely manner without losing his cool.

I ordered their Carne Asada, which was tasty but a completely different taste than what I was expecting. The refried beans were tasty, certainly not the kind you have in a can but also not the kind I was thinking of having either. The chips were good, but I anticipated a little more with all the raving in the reviews I read. I think that my family is not too used to Mexico City type of Mexican food so we were all a little confused with the tastes of our dishes, none were bad though. My Mom and Aunt had their flan which they said was a little too dense, but still good.

"I stopped in here to get a gel manicure while I was in town visiting my parents. Upon entering the salon, the staff seemed annoyed that I had walked in even though they were open for another hour. After choosing the color I sat down for the manicure. The girl was pretty rough with filing and pushing my cuticles. Then when she started cutting my cuticles she was rushing through it and very rough. On my left ring finger she ripped the cuticle so hard that it started bleeding (I don't want to be over dramatic and say gushing, but it was a lot). She put a little alcohol on a paper towel to try and stop the bleeding but it didn't work. So her next solution, while working on the rest of my nails, was to wad up some paper towels and basically make a tourniquet with the hair tie on her wrist. Not a doctor - but I know that's not sanitary. Then after it still wouldn't stop bleeding, she tried to carry on and at one point tried to use the file over my nail where it touched the blood that was still coming out. The file she was using had been pulled out of the drawer, so I'm not sure how or if it had been sanitized - or would be for the next person. At that point I asked her to please stop and that I just wanted a bandaid and to go home because this is not acceptable. She tried to argue a bit and I said absolutely not. I spoke with the manager who offered me a gift certificate, which I declined. I had 3 cuticles bleeding when I left. I've never winced so many times in a manicure. This photo was taken the next morning after cleaning and treating myself. It is still sore and on the verge of bleeding.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 1.0
"This was the cutes hotel I've probably ever stayed in. The atmostphere was definitely New Orleans themed. Loved the all white decor everywhere. Everything was walking distance, which was great. We showed up unexpectedly and unknowing the Essence fest was going on. However we did run into a few problems. And the best for me was the pool. Its open 24 hours a day!!  First of all, the walls are so ridiculously thin, I could hear our next door neighbor watching television. In the mornings, I could hear door being slammed. I later found that it was housekeeping doing all the slamming.. The rooms were very small, which doesn't really matter because we didn't spend much time in there anyway. But if you are a bigger person, you may want to reconsider. The showers were tiny as well (hardly any elbow space). And worst of all, when we went downstairs to ask for more towels to hit the pool, we saw a giant rat behind the front desk. If that thing wouldve been upstairs, I would've checked out immediately.

I like the ambiance, it's old school dark and wasn't busy on a Wed evening, definitely more a spot to have a few cocktails at a leisurely pace.  Bartenders were friendly, we got their when they opened up at 4 pm so not super busy but folks wandered in slowly. There were 2 at the time and one looked like she was in training very attentive.   The happy hour includes $3 small plates (the grilled cheese was delicious, the cajun poutine was good but messy, and my friend liked the pretzel -- a bit doughy for me, but he is from Philly and we both agreed the Guinness cheese sauce was delicious). They had about 6 or 7 options and at least 1/2 were vegetarian friendly.   Cocktail specials included $5 Pimms, Sazeracs (it might be rotating options), $3 wine options as well as Abita Amber and Bud Light.  Definitely like that the happy hour is until 7 pm so I don't feel rushed after leaving the office.   Pros: Good cocktails, some interesting and tasty small plates that had vegetarian options, chill ambiance, friendly staff and happy hour until 7 pm  Cons: Not great for a loud party crowd, although a decent size space it's set up for intimate small groupings.

Well for starters we have been going to this location for years. The last visits before Covid-19 the service was horrible.  Slow service on slow weeknights.  Not acceptable.  Servers are not even trained on Waiting Tables 101. When you out in your section check every table for refills and to see if everything is fine. Instead these servers take care of one table at a time instead of making multiple trips from their section to the bar/kitchen.  Manager was contacted and apologized but it continued to occur at subsequent visits.  Also they must have a new Meat Vendor in the last year.  Gone are the nice juicy steaks you could cut with a knife   Now you can't tell the difference between an 8 oz and a 6 oz.  medium well basically means a dry thin hockey puck. Good luck cutting it!   We ordered delivery on Thursday the food was delivered well before the text that said our food would be arriving in 15 20 minutes. So that was a plus.  The steaks were dry per usual and to make matters worse  the wedge salad was removed from the menu? Seriously.  You still serve salad and have all the ingredients for make a wedge why remove it?

This was my first ""curly girl"" hair experience as I've gone to my former stylist and a new one in this area and they dealt with my hair straight.  Before getting started Celia and I discussed my hair needs and what my objectives were.  She listened to my concerns and we went right over for a shampoo.

The best place I've had wings from in a long time. Wings are always cooked and seasoned properly just don't like to wait when placed an order and give adequate time to prepared an when you arrive you still have to wait almost 10 minutes when you gave them an additional 10 minutes so it could be bagged and ready to go and this is even when there is no one else is in the store.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

We went here for the breakfast.  Everything was solid.  Nothing to complain about from the eggs to the basic breakfast foods.  The service was great as well.  I was a little concerned at first that smoke would be an issue in the open restaurant but it seems they have a good air system to keep the smoke with the smokers.  But you do have to walk through the casino to get to the restaurant.  I will return.,Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 4.0

"Visited here due to a Groupon deal that basically cost me nothing (since they had given me a $10 credit). So glad we did!   Located off Ehrlich (but entrance is on Gunn) near the Citrus Park Mall, it looks like a total dive from the outside. But once inside, you are treated to a very tropical, fisherman's paradise. There are two separate dining areas, separated by a bar. This is where bad planning ensues. The back room has a small wall separating it from the bar, but the voices from the bar totally carry. Then they echo off this tin roof contraption above the roofs causing an annoyingly loud room. The front room seemed much quieter, but the noise level is my biggest complaint. There's also an outdoor deck, but it faces the busy road, so no appeal there.   We ordered some firecracker shrimp tacos, which were delicious, along with some burgers and macaroni and cheese (velveeta melted over bowtie pasta). Everything was excellent. We did not get appetizers or drinks, but would definitely do so on a future visit.   The kids were happy with the kids menu (items such as grouper nuggets, mac & cheese, chicken tenders, pasta, etc.) and were extra happy about the butcher paper they cover the tables with, allowing them free reign to draw on the whole table.   Our waiter was friendly, and even interacted with the kids. He kept our drinks filled, and told us about the specials. He did have to yell to tell us those specials, but again, not his fault, just a horribly echo-y room. We will come back for sure!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Dim sum is suppose to be an eating frenzy, but here, it took more than 15 minutes for a cart to even come by. If you want seconds of something be prepared to wait over an hour for it to come back by. It took over 20 minutes for them to bring out our first glass of water. Carts were falling apart, the servers were missing supplies that they should have.

"3.5 stars - Arrived at 10:30am and there were 1-2 tables already there. My Cambodian friends always visit here when they come to Philly so I came for a try.   Things I ordered:  Bone soup $8.95 - literally just bone with some meat and soup. The soup is so flavorful. I saw other people order it too so I wanted to try it. It is not on the menu, you have to just ask for bone soup. If I come here again, I would definitely order this.  Papaya salad $8.95 - different than the Thai salad. I like this one more. It tastes more like tamarind and each bite is cooling and very flavorful. This and the bone soup was probably the top things I liked from our order  Chicken mi ka tang $9.95 - rice noodle with chicken and sauce. There is no wok hay at all. The noodles seem like they were doused in sauce and cooked pretty quickly. The chicken was soft, tender, and tasty. But I would not order this again. Not bad, but had better elsewhere.  Fried dough $2.50/roll - we didn't intend to order this but the waitress was like ""want fried dough?"" And I said ""ok"" so we ended up with two fried doughs. I would just order 1 next time just to taste. The dough is very very crispy but it was so oily. The bottom of the basket that held the friend dough had a puddle of oil. Probably wouldn't get this again, unless if I maybe ordered congee or something.   Rice noodle soup with beef and meatball (#1) $8.95 - saw the neighboring table order 1 of this per person so we ordered one to try. Soup is the same as that in the bone soup. Noodle and everything else was standard. The meatballs are not made in-house (saw the delivery guy). The broth was really good.  Affordable prices. It's located in South Philadelphia in a small Southeast Asian/Cambodian town. Not the safest neighborhood in the streets surrounding the area, but not the worst. I parked a few streets away and found parking pretty easily. A few southeast Asian grocery stores with imported products which is hard to find elsewhere (even in nyc) so I would def go take a look at those stores.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

I also ordered the firecracker shrimp at the appetizer, didn't take any pictures because I was super hungry from being at the beach all day.

We weren't aware of their dress code (men can't wear sleeveless shirts) until we were in line so our friend had to go to the room to change. My other friend and I were going to drink at the bar to wait for his return, but we were told the bar was full service only. I get they're trying to get as many people in and served as possible, but I guarantee our bar tab would've been comparable to, if not more than a few of the meals in there so that's another star off.

"I travel to Philly quite often for business and usually stay in various hotels in the historic district.  Due to a customer move to the downtown area, staying in the historic district just is not convenient, so I decided to give the Four Seasons a try.  My excellent experience began the second I walked through the door.  Every staff member I encountered, from the concierge to the fitness room attendants were polite and very professional.   My room was HUGE and was immaculate.  The bathroom was so large it had a distinct echo.  I dined at both restaurants during my stay and both were top notch with great food and even better service.  Definitely the nicest 'hotel' eateries I've ever patronized.  And the hotel itself is located in an extremely accessible area of Philadelphia which makes it very easy to walk almost anywhere.  All in all, this was one of my most memorable stays in Philly and the Four Seasons had a lot to do with that.   Yes, it is expensive.  It's a Four Seasons after all.

"Summary: Of the four major chains (Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott, and Starwood) this would likely be my LAST choice for a hotel in downtown Indy. It isn't significantly cheaper than the Westin,  Sheraton,  Marriott, or Hyatt -  but it is a lot less quiet, the rooms are a lot more dated, the facilities are smaller, and its location is worse. Only stay here if everything else is booked.   Pros: it's location isn't horrible. You have easy access to city circle mall. Free Hampton breakfast. More availability than nearby hotels when everything else is booked. Rooms are clean, albeit dated.   Cons: When you walk into a hotel and the front desk offers you free earplugs,  you know it's going to be a long night.  You can hear EVERYTHING in this hotel.  The walls are paper thin, as are the windows.  I swear a garbage bin was dropped at least 10 times outside my window. I heard what sounded like gun shots.  Several sirens. Large groups of drunk businessmen from 10 to midnight.  Loud arguments by homeless people from 12am -  2am. Toilets flushing,  bathtubs emptying. TV's.  Don't expect to sleep past 6:50 either. Once one person in the hotel is up, everyone is up.   Internet is SLOW. I had free premium Internet as a diamond honors member and I couldn't even stream the republican debate in SD.  Horrible layout. You have to walk through the breakfast area to get to any of the conference rooms or to the hotel gym.   Although it's a central location,  it's not as good as most other downtown hotels. The larger hotels are just as cheap and have bridges and tunnels connecting them to everything downtown.  This one was excluded from that great city planning.  The pipes are old so the water smells like sulfur. The shower was tiny and had visible mildew around the door.

"Not living in the city makes it a hard find to get any parking close by. Especially if all the parking garages are full or blocked off for events, but hey it's Philly! So I recommend maybe taking the the train and walking a few blocks to save you the trouble.  Food wise this menu is unique to me because it offers empanadas and edamame. Wow too of my favorite things found at a pub! The empanadas were delicious and vary in what kind it is throughout the week (just like the Empanada Mama does.)  The edamame was fine for the eating. Just your typical soybeans with sauce.   My significant other and I both ordered sandwiches and loved the cheese sauce on the side for our fries. I had the Korean chicken sandwich and I loved every bit of it. No regrets.  He had Carolina pulled pork and enjoyed his as well.   Decor wise this place is your fun pub with different bottles for the drinking.  You can sit in the back of the room, towards the bar or even outside. The inside tends to get pretty noisy, but it's that fun bar atmosphere.   For the service I have no idea how only one girl was taking orders for a busy Saturday night. She was running all over the place. She did check up on us, but by the end we were waiting for our check. I understand that she was tending other people and I had no where else to be.

"My boyfriend and I are in the market for an engagement ring and after hearing about Robbins and the experience they offer, we decided to go there first. We were greeted upon entering by a nice woman with short hair and she explained the process. We really enjoyed trying on all of the different bands and I really appreciated this process! My boyfriend and I were both able to see the different styles and I was able to give him input on what I did or didn't like and we found the perfect setting.   After finding the setting, we sat down with a middle-aged male consultant ""Mark"" and that's where things started to go down hill. I told Mark I was interested in an Emerald cut or possibly a cushion cut. His response was that there wasn't really a market for an Emerald cut diamond anymore and that we should look at cushion cuts. He soon asked what price point we were trying to stay around... before ever asking what size carat we were interested in or getting to know more about what we were looking for style-wise.   He continued to show us three cushion cuts.They were all a J in color with an S1 or S2 in clarity, not good quality for the price they were asking. I asked Mark if he had anything that was a better value, and he came out 10 mins later with a square cut and a round cut that were better quality and price for the quality -but he clearly didn't care that the whole two hours we were there I had repeatedly said I didn't like the round cut style. He also never made an effort to see if he could get an emerald cut in, even though we were told from the beginning that he could. It is very clear that Mark was only interested in selling his current inventory as opposed to trying to help a couple find a quality and life-time piece in the style they were looking for and a good value. That's not how an engagement ring purchasing process should be handled.  We left and have found other jewelers who contacted their diamond dealers within 20-30mins of us being there to find emerald cut diamonds. Their prices are better, and the color, clarity, and value that they are offering is much better.   What started as a positive experience at Robbins, unfortunately became a very disappointing one because of the sales ""tactics"" that were used on us. It's even more disappointing to know that this salesman is the assistant store manager and makes a customer question the motives of this particular location. We won't be returning.

Food came out fast. Our server was sweet and attentive.   Cons: Nothing I ate was special. I had the clams casino, meatballs, and meat and cheese platter. All just OK. The meat and cheese platter was severely underwhelming. Meats were sliced thick?? Just ordinary salami and mortadella. I forget the cheeses.   My date and I only had appetizers.

"Context: Got takeout for lunch  What I got: Matzo Ball Soup (7.5/10) Not going to lie, this was actually the first time I've had matzo ball soup so I don't exactly have a lot to compare it to.  However, I very much enjoyed this one.  The flavor of the broth was rather light, which I appreciated in contrast to the very heavy sandwich I ordered alongside it.  It was nothing mind-blowing, but I would definitely order this again and recommend it.  Hershel's Special's Pastrami Sandwich (8/10) To caveat this rating, I am a huge fan of pastrami and so I will probably rate pastrami sandwiches higher than most people.  Although this wasn't exactly the best pastrami I've ever had, as I tend to prefer it thick-cut, it was definitely up there.  The fattiness and savoriness shone through in this sandwich, despite it being lean cut.  I didn't care too much for the Special's additions to this sandwich.  While I don't think it was bad by any means,  next time I will probably opt for either the full Reuben or just a plain pastrami sandwich with some spread. I also want to note that this was incredibly filling for the price - a great overall value proposition!  Final Word: The best spot I've been to in Reading Terminal Market thus far.  Would highly recommend and I'm looking forward to coming back here soon to try their corned beef!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Large comfortable beds coupled with a smaller bathroom gives it that old time feel. The creaky floors and the sounds that carry through walls aren't a bad thing, it adds charm and character.   The complementary breakfast delivery on silver platters is a huge upside! We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to have a more authentic stay in the French Quarter.

But the rest of the food at Cooper's is only okay, if not slightly unsavory. The truffle oil on the Portabello Mushroom and Shallot pizza is a wee overpowering, thereby inhibiting its consumer from enjoying the delicate thyme and shellbark goat cheese flavors.

"I went here with 2 friends to celebrate my 50th birthday. We bought packages to include: massage, facial and mani/pedicure. My thought was it would be a relaxing spa day with some friend time.   I was definitely disappointed. From the dated decor to the lack of amenities in the locker gym something was missing.   The massage with Petra was well done. I could hardly hear the music. The face cradle was covered with crinkly paper and s rough wash cloth. Typically, when I receive a massage, I receive a warm towel and a glass of water afterwards. Here, none of the above.   The facial was relaxing with lots of conversation. My face did look refreshed and felt revived.   After the facial, I went to the locker room to change from the cumbersome robe when my friend started calling my name. Apparently, the woman doing my mani/pedi was looking for me.  I quickly changed and re-entered the waiting/relaxation area to find no one there. I find my way to the nail area. The technician was sitting at her station on her cell phone and says in a low, abrupt voice-""pick a color."" No hello, no introduction. The color selection was very limited and the technician finally got up and showed me some other colors. I would say she did a fairly good job but I felt very uncomfortable the entire time and it was just not a pleasant experience. Very disappointed in the lack of professionalism from Irina.

"This tour is legit. Free parking, free beer and a free tour of the brewery? It can't get much better then that.   When I visited St. Louis, I immediately put the Anheuser-Busch Brewery Tour on the top of my to-do list. I was super impressed with the brewery. I really enjoyed the tour- from the Clydesdales to the canning- you get to see the complete brewing process. The tour lasted about an hour, but I never got bored. There was just so much great information! The guides were great- only problem was we kept getting backed up to the tour in front of us, so there was a lot of waiting around to get into certain buildings. Other than that, the tour was great!  And the free beer. Can you really complain when they give you free beer? At the end of the tour you are given 2 free samples (pretty good size), and are able to choose from a wide variety of Anheuser-Busch products to sample. I was really surprised they didn't only serve a standard beer like Bud, but also let you try other products such as Shock Top and AmberBock.  I definitely recommend the brewery tour for any St. Louis visitors. Have kids? No problem. There were lots of families on the tour, and the bar at the end offers soda and various drink selections for the under 21 crowd.

The restaurant was a little better experience but it's mostly the same food as the buffet. The ship's entertainment was good, and getting on and off the ship was okay. Our stops were Roatan (Mohagany Bay) and Cozumel - the island of Roatan is, in my opinion, a crap hole, I've no interest in going back.

"Poor service but good food. Kensington Quarters is loud and bustling with an industrial warehouse bent like most of the Fishtown establishments. It's more on the casual side than upscale side and there's nice outdoor seating in the back. We tried the charcuterie plate. Not bad, but could be improved on in terms of adding small touches. Could maybe improve with a small amount of gourmet cheese? All the meats were similar texture; would've been nice to have some denser sausage with the shaved meats. The wood fired eggplant was the stunner of the evening. The smoke and olive oil breadcrumbs encased the eggplant in a crunchy crust. Our main was the duck and it was good, but I must say the accompanying corn and shishito peppers were the REAL STARS of the show. We had a couple of glasses of wine and toyed with getting dessert but decided against it at the end, mostly because our waitress was so slow. She seemed very inexperienced and overwhelmed. My main recommendation to a place with food of this caliber is to make sure the wait staff are comfortable handling busy Friday and Saturday nights and, if not, cut their sections down to 1-2 tables or keep them on orientation/shadowing longer.

"Having been to virtually every worthwhile sandwich shop (that doesn't specialize in one type of sandwich: cheesesteak, hoagie, pork, etc., although I've been to those, too) from Spring Garden to Snyder Avenue, I can finally say that Stockyard is ""as good as it gets!"" (for any non-yelpers, that's what it says when you leave a five star review)  So far I've only had two different sandwiches, but I plan on coming back to try more. On my first visit, I had the braised beef (house-made whiz, onion, mushroom, baguette). It appeared to be the sandwich that was most raved about by customers. I can see why. The meat wasn't drowning in jus (or whatever) like I've had at other places with braised beef, and it wasn't dry. Now I'm biased because I love onions and mushrooms, but they were delicious (at other sandwich places, they just taste funny?). The baguette was perfect not too hard and not too soft!   On my second visit I was able to have a breakfast sandwich (I think they might stop at 11:30am?). You can customize your own sandwich with what type of meat, egg, etc. I had the house-made pastrami, fried egg, and Swiss with onions on an everything Philly muffin. Oh boy was it delicious! The pastrami was perfect for a breakfast sandwich. It was in smaller pieces. Some of them fell out, but that's probably because I wasn't holding it properly (though you get a fork with the fried potato side, so no biggie). It was delicious. I wish it were closer to my apartment, so I could go here every morning!   Both times I had the fried potato side. It's so good, like SO GOOD. They're super crunchy and come with a little cup of dip. I think the first time (lunch), it was the ""stock sauce,"" which was great, but the second time it was just ketchup, still very good. The second time (for breakfast) it came with peppers and onions, which is a great addition to fried potatoes!   I'll be back soon.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"We splurged and stayed a weekend in 402 at The Montecito Inn.  It's a by-gone era charm hotel.  It's not new money glitzy, rather old money swanky.  While I think it could use some updating, I really enjoyed the understated elegance and the homages to Charlie Chaplin.  The architecture of the property is gorgeous.  I loved the area and the quaint shops and delicious restaurants we were in walking distance to.  And with a short drive (5 minutes), you can easily get to State Street and other downtown SB attractions.  We were treated very well and our room was much larger than we expected.  The entrance/foyer/hallway with table and lamps, leading to a large closet was a nice touch.  The white marble, rather contemporary, bathroom seemed out of place for the rest of the Mediterranean/Spanish styled ambiance, but I definitely enjoyed the separate large tub, walk in shower and make-up area.  The french doors to the bedroom were pretty and made it a special, secluded area you can shut the world out of and focus on couple time and romance!  The living room area was ample and elegant (although an update would not be a bad idea) featuring a large fireplace.  The real fun was the huge windows that look out onto the street, with people walking by, that you can see out of, but they cannot see in to.  Overall, we had an amazing time and the overall charm and service we received outweighed any negatives.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 4.0

He then went on to tell me that they called everyone who rented a van that day to let them know they didn't have any vans.  I said, 'no, I called you and you confirmed a van and the time'.

The beef with broccoli tasted good, but I only got about a half a cup of rice. However, the main complaint was the ""shrimp"" lo mein. We literally got 6 shrimp and a whole lot of lo mein. I paid almost 10 dollars for a dollar's worth of noodles and 6 shrimp.  To say I won't be going back is an understatement.

And the menu....I can't wait to go back! We enjoyed all of the dishes we ordered - patatas bravas, bikini, cauliflower, two paellas, octopus and churros. We loved the octopus and churros so much that we ordered each once more after we polished off the first dish.   The patatas bravas was so crispy and light and paired well with the tomato sauce. The mariscos paella was delicious and was stronger than the chicken and sausage paella. The mariscos paella rice was coloured black by squid ink and absolutely covered by a variety of seafood - perfectly flaky white fish, fish eggs, scallops, shrimp, clams and mussels. The churros came with three dipping sauces - dulce de leche, raspberry vanilla and dark chocolate. I liked pairing it with the first two sauces. The churros were amazing - they were crispy, hot and evenly covered with sugar and cinnamon.

Where do they get their night desk people from, the bottom of the barrel? A little man with a Bocci ball head decided he thought it would be good customer service to argue with customers, roll his eyes at them, and was the most condescending asshat I've ever seen in the casino/hotel industry. The couple there were far more generous than I would have been and the little man with the Bocci ball head needs to be fired. I have already told people to cancel their reservations at the Row and go elsewhere. So far 25 cancellations and growing across three hotels. And those people are telling others to cancel. And this wasn't the only problem there but I don't have the inclination to write a ""War and Peace"" style novel listing everything that is wrong with the ""Row""; it would be 2021 before I finished the list (it's that extensive).  Was it worth it Eldorado to have a person that clearly shouldn't be dealing with people just cost you over 10K? Spare me your canned corporate vomit of ""We set a high standard for ourselves and are truly sorry to hear that standard was not met in your interaction with us."" because clearly your ""high standards"" don't even rise to the level of dog feces.

"I was so happy to have a new restaurant open up in downtown Tampa and was excited to try this place out but it didn't take long for Fynn's to dissapoint. Diners on a schedule- beware! Although the restaurant was not busy, it still took about 45 minutes to get three simple orders delivered. In those 45 minutes, we watched the cook come in and out of the kitchen and another server talking on her phone and taking a break to argue with her boyfriend outside. We should of gotten the hint about the quality of this place when we saw nearly whole plates of food left on the tables by other diners. The people at the bar seemed pretty content, but then again they had alcohol. When the food finally came, it was clear it wasn't worth the wait. Bland and plain. When it came time to pay, the incorrect cards were used to pay the bill and ""fixing"" that took another 15 minutes. No manager presence and no apology was offered by management although it appears a manager was fixing the problem. The transaction was never reversed, instead we were given a cash refund that was short of the actual amount.

"This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Reno! I have been there twice now and hope to go again soon. We went our first time and they did not look like they were open.  The restaurant is set up a little differently. They have tables and chairs downstairs, but the main seating is upstairs. We did not know that, so when we walked in, there was no one there, no customers or even a hostess. Then, a man came flying out of what I assume was the kitchen. He seemed as shocked to see us as we were to see him! We told him we were looking to eat there and he stated he had one table left upstairs and we were more than welcome to it. We walked up the stairs, not sure what we would find. We rounded the corner at the top and saw a fantastic restaurant packed with people, and sure enough, one table left in the middle. We took a seat and the waiter came over to greet us. We instantly felt welcomed and knew that we would enjoy the experience. We ordered the Gouda Quesadilla to start and it was amazing. They also brought us some fresh baked bread and a roasted garlic spread. Delicious. I ordered the Cheese Ravioli with the spicy vodka sauce. The sauce was like no other I had ever tasted before. It was spicy, for sure, but so delicious that I could not stop eating it. My husband ordered the Combo Plate with spaghetti, fettuccini, and lasagna and he said that would highly recommend it. But then there was the dessert! We ordered the warm lemon cake and the cannolis. I'm not a fan of lemon things, but I thought I should try it anyway and it was the most amazing cake I have ever had. It was warm and moist and the lemon curd that it was topped with was just YUM! The cannolis were delicious as well, but my heart was sold to the warm lemon cake!   My parents came to town a few months later and we took them here. My mother is very picky about lasagna and marinara sauce. She ordered their lasagna and declared it the best lasagna, next to hers! I ordered the Pasta Napoli, again with the spicy vodka sauce and I fell in love all over again. We also ordered the warm lemon cake, cannolis, and creme brulee. All of them were fantastic. Their prices are well in line with the food and the service! I forgot about the service, both of the waiters are attentive and fun.

They deal specifically with new clothes, shoes and boots, many still with tags or boxes, and gently worn tops, pants, casual dresses and even evening gowns that are up to date. I think they no longer have vintage clothes but I wish they still did because I remember beautiful vintage finds that were useful when costuming period shows for the theatre.

I realize the margaritas are BYO and all that, but still.  We had a freakin amazing meal for a freakin amazing price AND we didn't have to wait.  Incredible.  Boyfriend won the main course prize.. Lamb was beautifully seasoned and cooked to rare-tender perfection.  I don't think I've ever had such tasty meat.  Um.  Right.

"The haircut here cost me $45 - well over $50 with tip. Was my haircut good? Yes. Was it $45 good? I'm not entirely sure. Service-wise, what you get for your money is a cut and shampoo - not even a scalp massage!  But if you are one who likes to pay for the experience as well as the service, the argument can me made that $45 is worth it. The establishment is very old-timey. You walk in and have to go through a shop of colognes, hair products, ties, cuff-links and the sort before entering the actual barber shop area. In the waiting area you are offered a beverage of some sort, though because I only asked for water I'm not sure of the extent of their options.  There are Playboy magazines available to entertain you as you wait, which I thought was amusing but also a bit crass. The other unexpected thing is that there are beautiful women available to cut your hair in addition to the men in their bowties.   I had my hair cut by Sarah, a lovely lady who was technically competent and did a good job of keeping a discussion going as she cut my hair. Often times you can tell when the stylist is only feigning interest in you, but Sarah seemed sincere. She also followed instructions and stopped to ask me my preference at appropriate times.   So overall I had an enjoyable experience, I just don't know if I would go back every month for a cut there.

"I like the aesthetic that St. Joe's is going for, it has an old timey slightly beat up bar feel to it that makes comfortable. I appreciate that smoking is limited to the back patio. Since the bar itself is such a small space, I can imagine that smoke might become overwhelming. I like that they have NOLA Brewing beers on tap. I was not impressed by the actual bartender on my recent visit, he was inattentive and off in la-la land most of the time. I did have some sympathy for him though because he had to crank out one of those blueberry mojitos every 2 minutes. I did not really hang out in the back bar area and maybe I would have been more comfortable back there. The front of the bar was not really my crowd, a few too many popped collars I guess, but nice overall and I would stop in for another drink if I happen to be in the area.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 3.0

"Food is good but the service stinks lately. Last time they didn't mark my order on the take out and gave an excuse that ""I wasn't the one that took the order""!! This time I went in the pickup line. I was asked to go in the order line and stood behind 2 customers and a huge crowd in this COVID times with kids all over the place without masks!! Then I was called to pay for it and I suggested that they should have a register in the pickup line. Called a manager, who was helping in the line, and asked ""what it's pertaining"" instead of f taking care of the customers feedback. The manager said that the pickup person should have taken my card and then gone and got the receipt etc!! And then abruptly went and said he's getting late on the order line. Wow, no regard for customer feedback. We'll see what happens next time or they even have any time to respond to a long time customer!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"This place was amazing. The staff was friendly and if you never been to hot pot they would explain it to you.   We got the Heaven and Hell Pot and only the entry spice. The heaven hotpot had a mixture of dates, tomato, and corn. It had a nice aroma and light flavor to it. The hell portion is pretty spicy and you have to watch out for the peppers. It will numb your tongue for a few minutes, the base flavor for that is the same as the heaven pot. I love spicy food, but the beginner I believe is perfect. Any spicier would ruin the flavors. In fact mixing the two made it taste amazing.  The Wagyu beef was great and melts in your mouth. The pork belly was alright. The vegetables were fresh. The experience was amazing and fun.

"I want to give this place more stars, but I just cant. The setup of ordering at the counter then finding a table just DOESNT work when you dont have enough tables! We went last weekend, ordered for 4 people, then stood around waiting for an open table for at least 10 minutes. The kitchen let us know our food was ready, but we were still standing there with no place to sit! After another 5 or so minutes, they finally convinced us to sit outside even though it was FREEZING that night, and also sprinkling. The heaters helped, but the patio isnt covered so we got a little wet. The servers were very nice and tried to help as best they could, but it was not very pleasant just standing there waiting for a table, then sitting outside in the cold. The pulled chicken salad and the brussel sprouts were fantastic! The larb and the albacore on crispy rice were just ok.

"Don't know New Mama Juana from Old Mama Juana, but what I do know is that this cafeteria style traditional Dominican casa de comidas cooks up a storm of excellent dishes.  Sitting at the corner of County Line and Newtown Roads in Warminster, PA, it has recently expanded into the neighboring storefront to add a utilitarian dining room in addition to the small original corner shop.   I stopped in when I couldn't find the Mexican place I was searching for, and decided to go in flying blind. Very glad I did, because while really nothing like Mexican food, it did have a strong resemblance to Puerto Rican cuisine with serious pork, chicken and beef options, and white/yellow/brown rice and well simmered beans. While it all looked appealing, I was most attracted to the rotisserie quartered chicken.    It was excellent. Its skin was dry and taunt, while the meat beneath was moist and pull-from-the-bone tender. The taste was subtle, but well spiced and easy to pull apart and devour. If you said it was like duck comfit, you wouldn't be wrong. The beans were also delicious, but not spicy, and the yellow rice mixed in for a tasty textured combination. Liked the meal a lot.   Service was friendly and attractive, and although ordered at the cashier, it was delivered to the table with a sonrisa grande by their Guatemaltecan assistant.   There were many other interesting possibilities that may tempt me to return. I saw tostones, empanadas, and platanos rellenos, that looked great.  I just can't eat that much, and much prefer eating at the source to carry out.   New Mama Juana is the name.

My first time in I enter to find the employees arguing with each other over who gets to go on break. Each time the process of just getting my food often exceeds the 10 minute mark, excluding waiting in line, which is a total travesty. All staff there undeniably hate their jobs and make it obvious in how they communicate, ""what do you want?"", ""what else?"" I've heard every time in. Today was the worst of all too, my burrito might as well have been a big ass taco and one of the employees behind the counter cutting meat was clearly milking the clock.

"Got Burned at Bern's: this used to be our favorite restaurant and it was extremely well-run by the Laxer family.  Sadly, the parents passed away, who were really foodies, and they passed it on to their son David, who apparently doesn't have as much interest in food or running a restaurant for that matter. We came and ordered steaks, and it came with complimentary salad and soup.  The salad and soup were okay but nothing to write home about.  However, I must give Bern's props for at least serving those things free while other ""fine"" steakhouses do not.   But don't be fooled by all the nonsense about the food coming from their organic garden.  The vast majority of it comes from wholesalers just like any other restaurant and it is reflected in the taste.  There is no way they could provide that quantity of food from a little garden.   The steak itself was lousy and frankly I could get a better cut from a place for less than half the price.  It was very chewy and tough and frankly nowhere on par with actual fine steakhouses like Ruth's Chris, Morton's, Capital Grille, etc.   The tour of the kitchen and wine cellar are a nice touch and the white-glove service is nice, but this restaurant is no longer in the same league as the fine restaurants mentioned above.  It is simply living off its reputation from the past, and I could hardly see myself dropping $200 to $300 to have steak that's worse than a hibachi restaurant.  Not to mention everything takes so darn long: it's about two hours to have your meal and then you go upstairs to the Harry Waugh room which looks like a scene out of a sci-fi movie and have another bill and another wait simply to get desert.  And of course you will get socked with another $5 valet charge simply to park your car in Bern's own parking lot.

"HORRIBLE customer service at this store and with what appears to be LOWES return policy. I bought a gas lawnmower 60 days ago, never opened the box. Finally convinced the wife that a battery mover would be better choice, went to return the mower, was told ""sorry no returns on lawn mowers after 30 days"". At the time we purchased the mower the sales person told us specifically that we have 90 days to return the mower unused if we we decided to go with a battery based mower, so we made the purchase. When we asked for a manager, he was not only snippy in advising us that LOWES has a 30 day return policy on mowers,   but then claimed that there were numerous large signs advising customers of such policy in the sales area, as if we were just stupid. Needless to say, we took pictures of the fact that NOT ONE sign was posted ANYWHERE in 3 aisles of such tools, let alone large and visible ones, announcing this exception to the general return policy. When I got the same manager and showed this to him, he was unconcerned, shrugging his shoulders, saying ""well thats our policy - my hands are tied"" pretending to ask some floor workers if someone took down the signs,you know the ones that hadn't been there for SIXTY DAYS. Well.....guess what, mine hand are not tied and neither is my wallet tethered to LOWES. I will NEVER shop at LOWES again. Fortunately, everywhere there is a LOWES, there is also a HOME DEPOT. I know for fact that HOME DEPOT would have taken the return and at least offered a store credit and LOWES just earned HOME DEPOT my business from this point forward. Since I just spent about $10,000.00 in home improvement purchases over the past 4 months I am sure that HOME DEPOT will appreciate LOWES effort to become a marketing tool for HOME DEPOT.

The food here is always pretty good. The reasons for the one star is that they have the worst beer selection in all of Nashville. Everything today is about selection and knowledge. They have neither.

I would encourage the management to take a fresh look at the bar.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"It looks like Texas has invaded Florida - Texas flavor, that is. This is one of those eateries that takes something that you are familiar with - tacos and burritos - and then takes your mouth into a different universe of flavors with unique spicy and sweet combinations that will leave you thinking why has the universe deprived you of this wonderful taste experience your whole life.  This place is seriously in the middle of no where. Is it worth the trip? Yes. And here's why: you can't find the quality and this taste anywhere else unless you hopped a flight to Texas. If it was your usual good mexi taco place, I'd tell you where locally you could find an alternative so you wouldn't have to drive to remote butter-land. But you have to go to butter-land if you want  amazing Tex-Mex taste-bud altering tacos.  So I ordered the Simon Pure and the Mean Verde. I think some taste buds that were asleep woke up and danced. There was a hearty portion of fried avocado and portobello mushrooms and beans in my tacos so I feel like the you really get good quantity and quality for your money. The salsas on these tacos though are incredible - that's where the magic is.  If I were to criticize something, it would be the flour tortilla and the location (fact is, this should be in Tampa - it's not fair!). I really think a commercial flour tortilla cheapens the taste. The flavors from the generous stuffing bulldoze over any bland tortilla concerns. Had I known that they serve corn tortillas, I would have requested that, so make sure you ask for corn - makes a huge difference.  And Don't be scared off by the 3 hot peppers symbol on the menu - it's spicy but not so much so that you can't taste the other flavors. I'm a girl and I say it's fine.  Get yours to go or order in - but fair warning this joint is small. They have some tables on the outside (maybe ~4?) and maybe 8 inside. I'd eat mine standing if I had to- it'd be Worth the mess on my clothes. I can't wait to find another reason to go to butter-land for more life-changing tacos.   P.S. (In case the owners read this) please move this to Tampa. Land o Lakes doesn't deserve you!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Lets be honest...you are not really coming here for the food. It has a fun atmosphere for kids. Not really all that thrilling for adults. We made reservations so there was no wait. It took about 30 min to get our food which left the kids plenty of time to do the scavenger hunt and get the ""thunderstorm"" experience. The kids menu actually has some pretty good options. It's a shame some of the options aren't on the adult menu. The adult menu is pretty pathetic. If you want anything but a burger you are gonna pay a pretty hefty price. The burger was large. I ordered it medium but unfortunately the cook only understands ""well done"" I guess. Again, I can't complain too much as we weren't really there for the food and I wasn't expecting much.

This is one of our go to resorts in Tucson especially because it's so dog friendly. They even have dog room service! :) We have been coming here for years! We love it but our dogs may even love it more!   WOW! The staff here truly is amazing!! Peter up front is always super friendly greeting everyone. Jeff the bellman knows our dogs by name-you really can tell how much he loves animals-he is so awesome! Tate at the front desk went above and beyond for us on this last stay. Donald Robinson has always taken the best care of us when we stay here. The service here is STELLAR and they really are genuine and make you feel at home. This is one of the main reasons we have kept coming back for over 8 years. It really says a lot about a hotel when you can recognize a lot of the staff over time. We even recognize a lot of the in room dining staff - our dogs are conditioned to think that all room service is for them now!   They have the most impressive koi ponds that go through the property (they have food you can feed them too!!) as well as an amazing natural waterfall that is just a short distance up some steps from the pool area. The scenery is amazing. One of my favorite things is getting your morning coffee and walk around all the nature paths that wind around a good part of the property-want a more strenuous hike? Right off the property there's a ton of trailheads to choose from.   Flying V is excellent! The manager Rock is great-I highly recommend the table side guacamole and their ever changing seasonal specialties. We've never had a bad meal there.   Spa - always had a great massage and body treatments are very different and cool. Had an amazing massage by Lilla last time.   It looks like they are about to go through a major overhaul renovation of the entire property and I cannot wait!

"This place is definitely unique and I'd love to go back. It's mostly known for being strange more than anything else but, really, after a while, one human skull looks the same as all the others and the removed pieces of anatomy are no longer shocking. There really is an educational aspect to the whole place so I hope people really read the labels. Even the display cases are interesting because they are so old-fashioned. The only complaint I had was the museum employee who periodically barked that the visitors were too loud and threatened to kick people out (I hadn't heard a peep and found it relaxingly quiet). Piece of advice: leave the kids at home. I don't care how mature your kids are - just them being there makes other people uncomfortable and, honestly, they won't get much out of it, other than the ""that's gross"" or ""that's odd"" factor.

Korean BBQ Tacos, SO little filling, average flavor, nothing special. German Bratwurst (with horseradish spaetzle, red cabbage) VERY YUMMY... table favorite!

"I visited this Genghis Grill location about 3 weeks ago and it was terrible!  However, I want to say that I have been to other Genghis Grills in the past and have had good experiences -- love the concept and the food, but the service has never been strong.  This a place where your server has two jobs through the entire meal--keep your drink filled and bring you your order when it has been cooked and set in the window--for some reason the servers at this location couldn't do either.  Did I mention that there were 9 servers on the floor and only 8 tables occupied?  (Did I mention there were two hostess and one bar tender and a manager on the floor, too?  Quick recap of our service--times estimated:  7:00p - We enter the restaurant and are promptly seated -- there are less around 6 tables seated.   7:07p - We ask the hostess if we have a server--this is after being passed by every server in the restaurant once.  A server comes to our table and gives us bowls and takes our drink order. 7:12p - We get back to the table after making our bowls and dropping them at the grill (food line looked good).  We don't have any drinks. 7:16p - I ask a server coming out of the bar area (his name was Cody) if he could find our server--he asked if we had ordered tea and acted irritated that I had asked for our drinks (I guess 15 minutes wasn't reasonable to wait). 7:18 - Our tea finally gets to our table.  Food is still not at the table.   7:20 - With our server not in sight, we walk to the grill to pick up our own food.  (There are numbers on the table so servers can deliver the food) 7:27 - Drinks are empty...no server in sight. 7:32 - Cody walks by and I ask him to get his manager.  Drinks are still empty. 7:38 - Server refills our drinks.  Still no sign of the manager. 7:40 - Ask Cody if the manager is coming and he shrugs and snaps, ""I don't know"" and walk off.  Incredibly rude and his tone was awful. 7:45 - A woman named Mariana walks by and I ask if she could get the manager--she informs me she is the manager.  At this point I lose my cool...only to find out that Cody had never told the manager I would like to see her--so he lied to me.   Though she seemed a bit clueless as to the bad service her restaurant was giving, and seemed unable to control her staff, she did offer to pay for our meal which was the redeeming part of the evening.    Food was fine.  Average.  Service was terrible but the restaurant did the right thing in offering to comp the meal.  I doubt I will be back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

We really couldn't have had dessert as the waiter (there were only two on and they were busy-ish) was gone for a half hour at a time.  The food, not quite another story.  The menu- odd, just odd, and I eat out in major cities four nights a week.  The  pastas, except for the ricotta ravioli, lacked flavor- salt, really.  Bland!  The Sformato (sp?) was decent. The papardelle and tagliatelle were weak.  The entrees were different, but only slightly.   First of all, who wants to eat like a 10 oz. lamb Merguez sausage as their entree? if you are only going to have five or six entrees on the menu, this is an odd selection to add. Then, you eat it and are completely overwhelmed by sodium. All the salt missing from the pasta was found in the sausage.  My Golden Tilefish was served to me as ""sushi"".

"I think what people don't get about the Polo is that its a lot like one of those ""make your own adventure"" books from our childhood. Literally the Polo is one of the few places in Reno where anything can, and routinely does, happen.  A friend of mine introduced me to the Polo almost 10 years ago. Sitting in some more upscale place he looked at me agape and in shock when I told him I had never been there nor had I ever heard of it. Upon going, it was like someone gave me the keys to a Reno long since gone, which was a place I missed as I grew up here.  Long and short, I love the Polo. Frank, the owner, is one of the more entertaining guys in Reno. Yes, the average patron is a senior citizen. So what?

"I have a torn disc in my lower back and spent 4 years seeking relief for lower back pain and muscle spasms- steroid shots, pain medication, muscle relaxers, physical therapy, massage therapy, etc. After a friend at yoga recommended Emily, I finally decided acupuncture was worth a try. Within hours of my first treatment, I found the relief I had been seeking for years.  I can't say enough good things about Emily. She is a true professional. She makes you feel comfortable and relaxed. She explains everything she is doing to help you and personalizes each treatment for your needs that day. I highly recommend her! Before I started my acupuncture treatments about 5 months ago, I definitely fell into the ""skeptical about acupuncture"" category. When nothing else was helping my back pain and spasms, I figured it couldn't hurt. Obviously I am now a firm believer and wish that I had started this years ago! With Emily's help, my pain is significant reduced and my back muscles are more relaxed (no spasms). I can exercise (hot yoga, cycling, running, weight lifting) without pain and muscle tightness. I sleep better. I travel better. I finally feel like a normal, functional human again.  All this to say- I am a 100% satisfied customer. Emily is undoubtedly an excellent choice for acupuncture.

"This place has everything going for it but the horrible service, mediocre food and high prices are going to put it out of business before it ever has a chance. We had fajitas, a burrito, a beer, a margarita, and ceviche and it totaled $50. Pretty expensive for good Mexican food but really expensive for overcooked, bland meat. We had to ask someone to wait on us twice after waiting for 20 minutes. They never brought us water and I had to get a high-chair myself from upstairs. And they never asked if we wanted another round of drinks, the one thing they actually did well.   I get that new places have to work out the kinks but not even making eye contact with your table to let them know you'll be with them or that you see them is ridiculous. Don't make me ask you to wait on me.   We have a toddler so when we go out to eat it can be a bit challenging to keep her attention so waiting and waiting for service is not really conducive to a relaxing meal.

After reviewing the wine menu we decided to go with a bottle of Italian red.   For an appetizer we ordered the pheasant dumplings. These things were AMAZING. Tangy and not to filling, we absolutely destroyed them instantly.  For the entree we decided to go with the Japanese wagyu with a side of roasted cauliflower. I highly recommend these delicious cuts of beef if you decide to come here. It arrived on a slate platter with 4 optional topics. We sprinkled the salt and pepper over the top and began to enjoy. The wagyu was everything I hoped and dreamed for it to be. Thinly sliced with a charred exterior, we went with rare plus, every piece was savory and delicious. It was like candy.

I've had her not pick up when I was transferred to her (at the Largo office) even when the receptionist was talking to her in front of me and then told me she was going to transfer me to the doctors assistant.,Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 1.0
What can I say? Where else can you go for a good meal on Christmas night?  In all seriousness the food is not bad for the price. You can get more than enough food with one of the combos. It's not the greatest Chinese food I ever had but that wasn't the expectation. The place looked clean and had a great number of options. Service was fast and they were pretty busy. I will probably be back more than once. Thanks Hong Kong!,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I regret giving this place anything less than five stars but for this visit I have no choice. My wife and I were there for lunch. I ordered the margarita pizza and it came out saturated in olive oil.  I used eight napkins trying to soak it up but it was too late, the crust was a soggy mess and olive oil just ran down my hands.  I changed my review from three stars to four for two reasons.  First of all, my wife had a custom pie that was not saturated in olive oil and it was very good.  Secondly, it's a correctable problem. Next time I'll just have to remember to ""hold the oil"".",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Not thinking Mexican while in New Orleans?  Think again!  Especially for happy hour!  Monday-fri at 2-4, they offer select tacos for $2.00 and half priced drinks.  Makes me happy!  Owned by Chefs John Besh and Aaron Sanchez, the decor is fun and service by our waiter, Alex, was superb!    They give you a bowl of plantains and chips to enjoy with very flavorful salsa.   I chose the cauliflower taco, while not on the happy hour menu, I highly recommend as it was delicious. Crispy cauliflower with salsa verde, corn salsa, it was different and a party in my mouth.

"Okay, here's my story with CPR:  I shattered my iPhone 7 so badly that the glass was falling out in small shards. Luckily, I had insurance with Sprint, right? Wrong. I went to the store only to be sent to another location that basically told me that they would have to ship my phone off to the repair company and it would take 5 days to get it back to me. Well, that wouldn't work for me because I was moving to a new place in 3 days. Anyone who's moved knows how much a cell phone can make or break the trip. On topic that, I would have to pay a deductible of 100$ for the parts used to fix my screen and because the rest of the phone was fine, they wouldn't replace it for me completely. The Sprint guy told me the place next door could fix it for about $150. What?! This pace could get it back to me within an hour like new for only 50$ more? Yes, please. When my boyfriend and I walked in, a man came out from behind the counter and told us he could do it right then, but he'd have to finish up some things cause he had been closed already for 5 minutes- we didn't even look at the hours on the front door and felt so bad! But he was so nice he told us that he could absolutely do it and he was going to be there anyways. Since we didn't want to keep him there, we gave him our info and he told us to come back in the morning and he'd have it done for us then. So I get there at 10 sharp, hand him my phone, and then get back at 10:55. He walked out with my phone looking completely new! Then I told him I would like to look at cases and he told me that some were on sale and that a free screen protector came with it! He ALSO installed it for free right the and there. When I looked at my receipt, I saw that he charged me 100$ for the new screen (exactly how much Sprint was trying to bleed me for-why even have insurance?!) and 50$ for labor, so I was paying extra only for the labor which was crazy fast and immaculate! Awesome. I have never had a more pleasant experience dealing with my phone in my life. It was fast, fairly priced, and friendly. Thanks Christopher, you really got me out of a tight spot!

"This is more like a 3.5 review. I've heard mixed things about this place, but when my friend picked this as the spot for her 30th birthday dinner I was still pretty excited to try it out. My husband and I got there before the rest of our party so we sat as the bar and I ordered the Mardi Gras margarita. I guess I'm so use to going to typical Mexican restaurants that I was expecting this $11 drink to come out in a big regular margarita glass. I wasn't too surprised when that wasn't the case though. The drink tasted good, it was just tiny. When more people arrived we were seated and the salsa with chips and plantains were brought out. Delicious. I loved those. When the birthday girl arrived, our server came around to take just drink orders even though most people had a drink. He wouldn't even let someone order guacamole. He struck us as a bit odd and service was extremely slow. We ended up here for 2 and a half hours. Once the drinks came out, my friend was able to order the guacamole which never came out until he asked about it again. I do have to say that when it did come out it was really yummy. My husband and I split the pork burrito which came out already split for us and was very good. We also ordered a side of street corn which was pretty good as well. Overall, I enjoyed the food but the weird service and high prices made the experience less than stellar. I have noticed though that they seem to have great happy hour specials on margaritas and tacos, and I would like to come back for that.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

The pizza is nicely done, but honestly, I go there for the bread and the salad.  They have self-service beer and soft drinks, which is nice because they have a good size beer selection. I've always had fantastic service; I've never had a bad meal. This is solid food and a solid business.  I don't give them a fifth star because of the beer.

"Had a quite wonderful brunch.  Found the menu to be varied and with some good sounding stuff.  I had the Taco Salad in a tortilla bowl.  The lettuce was crisp and NOT wet!  The chicken was sufficient as were the other ingredients.  My request for no sour cream was noted and the dressing served on the side as ordered. The only thing I would have liked would have been a few more black beans.  They did put a lot of raw mushrooms in the salad mix.  I'm not a fan of those.  The waitress said next time to ask for them to be saut√©ed and that would be acceptable for me.  I've never experienced a taco salad as dry as this one.  I enjoyed that, the bottom of the tortilla bowl would have been edible (not soggy) if I had that much appetite.  My companion enjoyed his burger and fries.  For a bar the atmosphere was very inviting.  The actual bar was in a divided room on a slightly lower level.  We might sit in there next time so as to see the football game better. Although I'm not a beer drinker I did notice they have more beers on tap than any other place I have ever seen!  There is a quite inviting patio with lots of blooming flowers for those that want to sit outside.  It is far enough from the street that it is probably fairly quiet and not too much street dust blowing in. I did not go out there.

"My first visit! I had heard some pretty marginal reviews about the place so I was a lil nervous but our experience was a lot of fun. We had the backcountry nachos, sweet potato fries and some drinks. It was latish (around 9:45) on a Wednesday and the place was very quiet. Had a supersized booth. The televisions are massive and the place is very spacious. Definitely has a modern high ceilinged sports bar type atmosphere. Newspaper clippings in the bathroom, sports memorabilia decorations. Bud Light draft was $1 when they hit a home run. :) Go Rays! Servers were friendly. The sweet potato fries were excellent and served in a funnel (euro style) with a honey dijon vinagrette dipping sauce. The backcountry nachos we got had pulled pork (chicken also available) and came with okra salsa and lots of yummy cheese. I really enjoyed everything we had. We added avocado and it was perfectly ripe and delicious . Only quibbles were that there weren't any specials (it's always nice to have lots of specials!!!) and we ordered a side of sweet potato fries and when we got the bill it was more than we expected and we found out we were served an appetizer portion. Not big a deal and they would have corrected if we had asked. Will go back. They do have specials during football games.

If looking for takeout they have a separate ordering area and nice waiting area.  I ordered the kebab platter to go.  Meat is grilled just right and tender.  The rice and salad were good too.  Fries were typical frozen type, and I would have preferred more rice and less fries.  I still consider their hummus one of the best I've had (goes great with the fries).

"I'm a creature of habit. I have been coming to New Orleans for over 25 years and stay at the Monteleone the majority of that time.  I have seen a gradual decline in service and professionalism.  Our recent visit had been booked eight months in advance.  We had reserved a room with a king size bed. We decided to take our niece for her birthday and had requested it be changed to two queens. I called once a month for the next eight months and was told that the request has been noted.  Upon arrival,  the hotel was full, and our reservation had not been changed.  We ended up having to upgrade to a suite at an additional cost of $700 per night.  Upon pulling out the sofa sleeper for our niece, we found that the sheets were still dirty from the previous occupant.  We went downstairs to dine at Criollo, only to be distracted from our own conversation by the private lives of the entire staff... waiters, chefs, busboys and manager.  We experienced the same with the lobby floor staff throughout our stay.  As far as any amenities, there are none other than a $1200 per night chocolate on our pillow.

Why compromise your standards to go to a pretentious and cramped ""gastropub"" when you can go to an actual space with real class, an amazing bar, and real dining like the Sazerac offers within its bountiful allure.  I really don't even like sazeracs but I will down one here just to get my out of town friends to experience it.  I would suggest dressing up a bit as this space deserves it.  This is a great place to just get comfortable and enjoy the company you're with or meet new people.  I also think they serve some fantastic food in the restaurant.  I've had some really good gumbo here and I've always been happy with the quality of the food and service.  I much prefer the food here to the next door Domenica but the happy hour specials aren't as generous. The best time to visit here is during Christmas when they really bling the entire hotel up to make it a true wonderland.  This is definitely a ""must do"" spot and a great place to enjoy some good food and drink in a civilized setting.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0

"What a cool, inviting quaint pub. You certainly get all the Irish you want from the beer to the green walls and decorations. They had a folksy band playing and you could tell their were many regulars in attendance,  as everyone was singing along. It didn't take long to get into the spirit of the Pub. The staff was very professional and super friendly, you felt like part of this big family all laughing and singing and let me not forget drinking beer. As I am seldom a beer drinker, thank goodness for the full bar! We didn' t have any food so I can't swear that it is good. What I can tell you is that I saw some amazing food passing by me and I wanted to sample it all. There were quite a few people eating, so I can only assume the food is pretty good. Next time I will try the food. This is a nice Irish Pub full of happy people, song and good cheer! What's a girl to do?

"If you are travelling to or through this part of Pennsylvania and are looking for a place to spend the night, this Comfort Inn is to be avoided!   I have stayed in less than desirable hotels in many countries on several continents but this Comfort Inn makes questionable establishments in Central America and Africa look good by comparison.   After a long day of travelling and helping a family member move, I was looking forward to a hot bath and a good night's sleep. I checked in to this Comfort Inn and went in to the bathroom. What I found was beyond repulsive and disgusting. (See pic). Feces on the toilet, the previous guest's old soap and shampoo bottle in the shower and several missing towels showed pretty clearly that the bathroom had not been cleaned by housekeeping or checked by their obviously inept ""Housekeeping Supervisor"".  I went down to the front desk with pics in hand to complain and was told ""I don't check the rooms"" in a lovely ""I could care less"" attitude. No apology for the human excrement coating my toilet, no basic level of customer service whatever. The personality deficient front desk clerk did send a maintenance person up to my room to take care of the unacceptable mess. The maintenance guy (Jason) apologized several times and was really professionally first rate. Despite the fact that he cleaned the mess up, I still could not find the courage to use that toilet, shower without wearing socks or sleep in this repulsive room without being fully clothed in the bed. If the housekeeping department of this dump is willing to leave human feces on the toilet...what is in the bed that I am about to sleep in? (Forgive me while I go vomit)...  I contacted the manager who was apologetic and said that ""it wouldn't happen again"". That's all very nice but how about being proactive instead of reactive?   On the whole, I would advise any traveler to avoid this disgusting dump of a hotel. I must confess that I am not fully aware of what is available in terms of lodging in this area but in terms of this Comfort Inn, it would be better to spend the night sleeping in your car on the side of the road than to risk your health in this absolutely pit of a hotel.   Word to owners, management and Choice Hotels Corporate - you should all be ashamed of yourselves for operating such a dump under your branding.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 1.0

"This was one of my worst hotel experiences. ever. the main house and rooms seemed to have some charm and character. . .  but out near the patio was a different story.   1.  not well maintained... my bathroom floor was dirty, I had to wash the floor to clean up whatever junk was on it... and the edges of the floor were black.  and I mean black.  the main room floor was also dirty and we needed to wear shoes at all times. 2.  one of the mattress had died 5 years ago and was a soggy mess. 3.  thread bare, holes-in-them sheets. 4.  no place to hang clothing besides the back of the chairs or hooks in the damp bathroom. 5.  one window, high up on the wall that did not open; no shade pull so you had to climb up on a chair to raise the shade to admit light.  then discovered that if you opened the shade people could look right in as they went up & down the stairs. 6.  no phone in the room; no wifi 50% of the time. 7.  dirty patio area, table tops, chairs... and this is where we were served breakfast. 8.  mangy breakfast foods.  and the highlight was a bowl of peeled hard-boiled eggs that was full on our first morning (not placed on ice while sitting out on the table) and by day three there were fewer eggs in the bowl and they'd become funky smelling.  I didn't realize what was going on until after a funky tasting mouthful.  we realized that at least THREE mornings they'd been sitting out, in hot muggy weather, for three hours at a go.   9.  people would sit out on the patio into the wee hours and then start up as early as 6 a.m. yappin' loud enough to keep us awake.  at least twice I had to ask people to keep in down due to the late hour. 10.  high heat and high humidity... but an old AC unit that didn't keep the room cool.  and last but not least... as we were waiting for our cab, a new person was checking in and getting quoted prices that were $65 to $100 less than what we'd been charged.  $750 for four nights in this crappy place.  sadly it was my first time to New Orleans and this aspect ruined the experience for me.  this was chosen because of Orbitz and it does have some decent reviews...  and looked like a great little hotel. and it was... 50 years ago.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 1.0

"This was my first time visiting the Sponge docks and there were plenty of places to eat. I choose this place based on their marketing. I was met on the street by a nice lady handing out flyers. The deal was $9.95 lunch special and it included a soft drink and desert so I was sold!  It was normal lunch time not busy though, when I went there with a friend, my niece, and her boyfriend. We decided to sit outside and wasn't too hot, but next time I'll be going inside because did end up getting hot.  We all ordered some variation of the lunch special and we recieved a free ordered of sagnaki. The sagnaki came out right away and it was delightful. We were also given some bread and butter before our meals came out. The food didn't take long. I had the chicken souvlaki and Greek salad. The portions were very generous for a lunch special. Everyone enjoyed their meals. At the end of our lunch, we each received a small piece of baklava and it was a nice treat.  My only complant was that are service became slow once we were done.

"Its really hard to rate this place with an overall rating, because it depends so much on what you're in to.  So here is an itemized list:  1. Location: McGuinn's gets 4 stars for being one of the only places to go in the dismal, boring Lawrenceville area.  It is always a sure shot that there will be fun people watching possibilities because its always packed.  Minus one star for the constant police presence, as they know, too, that its the only place to choose from. 2. Music: Anywhere from 1-5 stars.  Ok, that isn't fair.  There is a HUGE variety - on any given night I've walked in to rock, sometimes rap, sometimes punk and so on.  So 5 stars for variety, but sometimes paying $5 at the door for something you'd pay $5 not to have to listen to is a hard pill to swallow. 3. Ambiance: Uh, there's not much of one.  Green ""pub"" walls, restrooms in need of a scrub down and update....BUT, they do have pool tables that are a big draw, and recently added a multi-game arcade machine and a sweet Dark Knight pinball, so I'd have to bump them up a star or two for that.  Hubby and I have spent countless hours just drinking cheap beer and playing the games.  4. Service/Drinks: 2-5 stars, depending on the bartender.  They are all very much on top of getting you that next drink, but some of attitudes that are pretty fierce if they don't recognize you as a ""regular"".  Shots and beer are usually cheap and there's almost always something on special, mixed drinks tend to be tiny and way overpriced, esp. given the size.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I expected more from this diner. The food was fine but the portions were underwhelmingly small and overpriced. The best value were the mimosas ($6.07 before tax).   I ordered two eggs scrambled, bacon and homefries. The eggs were delicious im sure it's because they were drowned in butter but I was so disappointed with the homefries. The portion was microscopic and it was barely crispy, as all well made homefries should be. The bacon was nice and crispy and maybe had 1 more slice than average.   The french toast order was deep fried which made for a nice texture but made my fianc√©'s stomach feel a little upset because of all the oil.   The waitresses were super attentive and friendly. There was a shift change during our meal and our waitress was sure to let us know before she left. The new waitress checked on us and refreshed drinks.

The food is great - if you get the hibachi, you get an insane amount of food for what you pay for. I always end up taking about half home. The sushi is delicious too - if you love sushi, try it! My favorite thing to get is the shrimp dinner... comes with soup and salad, shrimp appetizer, your protein, and vegetables and rice. So. Much. Food.  The place is clean and simple, with some more modern decor in the sushi/bar area. The bar is pretty big for a hibachi restaurant, in my opinion. Bartender I had made them strong too. Chefs are personable, and have a sense of humor - don't think I've ever been here where I've thought someone had an attitude.  Overall, if you enjoy hibachi, Izakaya should be your place.

The hostess did not asked if we wanted the dining room or loud bar for seating. We realized this after being seated in the bar. The waitress didn't know what the featured special was, (we told her since we saw it on a board in the lobby), she didn't offer the beers on tap after my husband requested a beer ( he just had to throw one out and guess for 1 possible beer on tap), she brought our meals out and gave them to the wrong people after placing the plates perpendicular to each person. Really? If you have ever eaten out, you would have an example of how they place your plate in front of you...Or maybe see how the other wait staff is doing it. We were not offered dessert, just offered the check. We walked through a pile of chips on the floor to get to our table and had to walk through them again and MORE to get out 45 minutes later.

Like any person would do, I called the restaurant to let them know of the mistake. The person who answered didn't know what to do, told me the manager would be there in 15 minutes and to call back. When calling back, I talked to someone else who said the manager would be there in an hour. I called back again, still no manager and left my phone number. Never hearing anything back, I called one more time.  I finally spoke with the manager who accused me of lying. Not only accused me of lying, but accused me of trying to scam them out of free food. I never mentioned anything past 2 of the 3 vegetarian meals containing meat. He said he was tired of me calling every week trying to get free food. Never mind I order at least weekly from this location, I had NEVER called about a complaint ever. I have NEVER received worse customer service from a restaurant in my life. To make matters even worse, when I calmly tried to explain to him that he is getting me confused with someone else as I had never complained about anything previously, he was quick to be defensive and say ""I understand. I speak English, don't say I don't."" What??? And done.  I wound up calling the Franklin location, to lodge a complaint and never heard anything back.  I will not be going to this restaurant ever again.  The 2 stars pain me to give them, but I actually like the food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I have tried 3 of reds dishes. I read on MSN an article highlighting the best chinese restaurants in every state. They picked this one for Louisiana. There is very little resemblance to any real chinese food served at reds. Throwing on globs of ginger and diced garlic doesn't make the food chinese. I've been lucky enough to have lived in NYC and Las Vegas where real authentic chinese food is served. I really don't blame reds.

"A place that is not worth the hype...  The prices are okay, the food could be better... WAYY BETTER... Hash mountain, Hash browns topped with corned beef hash 2 poached eggs and a cheese blend... Lets begin, the corned beef hash was good so it was unfortunate you only get a spec worth compared to the mountain of bland hash browns, which definitely would've benefited from being browner as the tasted and looked like they were steamed, not fried, the only thing that even made them edible was the yolk from the eggs and the decent amount of unmelted cheese they topped it with.  The rest of the party had eggs and sausage, which I was relieved to see the sausage were huge... but accompanied by the same bland under-cooked hash browns and eggs that are (you guessed it) nothing special at all. The service leaves ALOT to be desired as well... from the fact that you cannot leave with leftovers because and I quote, they ""have enough customers so they don't do that""... to the haughty rushin' Russian waitress who forces you  to blurt out your order, regardless of whether you're ready, and then spends the rest of your visit ignoring you, even if all you need is a fork... and good luck adding on to your order, guess they don't do that either.

"Unfortunately the experience I had with Lucca on my wedding day was a bad one. We only spoke with Melissa leading up to the wedding. I found each time I spoke to her things would have to be repeated because she would forget what was spoken about previously. Nothing was written down or notated which was very evident on the day which was CHAOS. They thought we had a coordinater despite all communication coming from me and me sending them a vendor list with all the other vendors contact details on? Melissa was not there and Mark kept coming up to me to ask questions about timings/preferences. Our lifesaving photographer had to act as a go between and relay messages to the team so I could actually sit down and enjoy the meal! The ""professional"" bartender we hired out through them at $50 an hour made several mistakes including leaving our alcohol outside after ""cocktail hour"" and moving it into a storage room without telling anyone so half of it was missing, we ran dry and it put a dampener on the day. Lucca to their credit refunded us the money we spent on the bartender.  The food itself was very disappointing. The charcuterie was small and there wasn't really enough to go around. Melissa also offered to provide GF crackers for the charcuterie so I could eat it too but when I asked Mark on the day none were provided for me. The pizzas were bland and had no real toppings on for example someone couldn't eat cheese and got a pizza with onions and basil - no meat or veg. Just bread and sauce. I'm gluten free and my pizzas constantly came out cheese-less and plain? The salad was meant to come with tomato but it was just a plain leaf salad with cheese. Again we had discussed having it cheese-less for vegans/lactose intolerant people but this also wasn't done. We had planned to serve the homemade gelato desert (which turns out was store bought) with our wedding cake however they tried to serve up before people had finished their pizza or before the cake cutting (we had run off time). They plated it up and all we could do is put it in the freezer where it partially melted. They left before desert and we then served ourselves!  I had a almost perfect wedding day my only regret is I wish I chose one of the wonderful professional caterers I had spoken to rather than Lucca!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I completely agree with Jessica. I bought the Groupon also, and was looking forward to a pleasant experience. I receive massages regularly, and have been fortunate enough to  try various massage styles around the world. The massage I received at Massage Essence was TERRIBLE. The therapist I had was highly unskilled and had horrible technique and form. In addition, she would NOT STOP TALKING!!! Nonstop chatter the entire time, including sharing with me some very personal and inappropriate information about herself. When I originally called to book my massage, I let them talk me into adding 30 minutes to my time. Not too bad, because the 60-minute massage was a good deal with the Groupon. However, it turns out no one mentioned the time extension to the therapist because she tried to up sell me DURING the massage! When I politely pointed out that I had already booked, and paid for, an additional 30 minutes, she was uncomfortably surprised. Awkward... Needless to say, paying for the additional minutes was a mistake - all I ended up receiving was a 90 minute oily rubdown. I won't name the therapist in this review, but I am confident in saying that previous reviewers have had the same therapist.  I was so upset by my experience, it bothered me for days. I sent an email explaining the situation and asking the owner to contact me, but no response. I did go back for the facial, and was pleasantly surprised. Kathleen did a fantastic job! I was more relaxed afterwards than I had been in months. That is how I should have felt after my massage, as well.

The bar bad a good selection of beers, and they had lots of televisions, as well as the MLB ticket.  However, most of the tv's were off when we went in, the sound on the two that were on was turned off, and 80's music was playing instead.

You see, I love mushroom pizza, it is my stand by, and I always order it. Hellfire has no mushrooms! When I asked why they told me they wern't ""goumet"" enough. Really? What makes pepperonis so much more gourmet? Then I asked if they would ever have them, or if I could call in a request, and they said no.  I mean I get the idea of lifting pizza up to be something more gourmet, but it just came across as being snobby, towards my favorite topping.

"I've been to Subways many times before and have never had such poor service as this. I went to this location Friday, July 14, 2017. The girl behind the counter was a little quiet yet very polite. It wasn't the quickest, especially since no one else was in line, but none the less, I had a great sandwich for under $5. So no problem yet. I felt like my experience was decent enough to come back again. Fast forward to the next day (7/15/2017). My boyfriend and I enter the store to one girl working by herself and no customers in the store. The girl was wiping down tables as I said hi and approached the counter, all I got back was quick eye contact and mayyyybe a slight nod.. Anyways, I stand at the counter and wait. It's very clear that we were not a priority to this girl, as she didn't come to help us order. After a few moments, I even politely ask if the store is still open since no one was approaching the counter to help us (hoping that this would urge the girl to assist us.) she answers yes but continues on cleaning. At this point, we had been standing at the counter for 3 whole minutes waiting for this girl to wipe down Every. Single. Table. Now, I know this isn't a crazy long time, but I'm beginning to get frustrated as there was no ""I'll be right with you"" or a ""Hang tight for a minute"" and keep in mind, we didn't even get a ""hello"" or ""welcome"". Plus, there was literally no one else in the store. Shouldn't the customers be at least a little bit of a priority? This girl takes her sweet time without addressing us at all and goes into the back room. It's now been over 5 minutes and I'm assuming she'll come out to help us now, but after a few more moments, I decide it's too late. I left the store before the girl even came out from the back..

"A friend of mine told me about BBQ shrimp, and after googling it to find out what it was, I felt like it was the only thing I've ever wanted in my entire life. (It's shrimp sauteed in a special spicy, creamy, buttery, salty sauce.) Fortunately, our Airbnb was just down the street from this place that apparently invented the recipe for BBQ shrimp.   The restaurant was pricey, so my friends and I called ahead to see if we could order the BBQ shrimp to share at the bar during happy hour, rather than eating a full meal there.  The person we talked to said it shouldn't be a problem.  We stopped by happy hour for some reasonably priced wine and oysters, but unfortunately they were so busy that they refused to serve us entrees at the bar.  This meant we had to follow their really complicated, un-intuitive, scavenger-hunt like instructions to complete our happy hour goals. We had to make three weird stops within the same restaurant: The first stop was at the bar for drinks, where we paid for our drinks and oysters.  At the bar, they gave us a token to redeem our oyster. Fortunately, we were allowed to take our drinks to the oyster counter, and we stopped there for a while to redeem our oyster token. The oyster bar wasn't comfortable or relaxing, but it's definitely a fun experience.  They shuck the oysters right in front of you, and it's so small that you will be forced to befriend the other customers on either side of you. After the oyster counter, we stopped by the actual restaurant where we got a table to order our BBQ shrimp.   We were trying to avoid this last step, because the restaurant is pricey, and we just wanted to order a couple of dishes to sample for our group. Fortunately, our waiter Louie was fantastic and completely understanding of our situation. We ordered the BBQ shrimp and the oysters Bienville, which are stuffed with a delicious mystery stuffing, and I think broiled. (Our server actually did tell us what was in the stuffing, but I forgot).    We were all really full before we even got to the restaurant, but none of us had any regrets because of how delicious all the food was.

"A friend and I tried out Bakersfield this past Wednesday, we were surprised that wait time we were quoted was almost 2 hours (due to the CMA event happening downtown). We put ourselves on the waitlist and called around to see if we could get in anywhere else sooner but decided to wait it out and stick with Bakersfield and I'm so glad we did! Things cleared out pretty quickly and we were seated after only waiting about 35 minutes.   We ordered guacamole & queso as appetizers, the guac was delicious and a nice hint of lime to it. The queso wasn't like your average Mexican restaurants cheesy sauce, it was more textured and in my opinion, kind of bland - next time I'd try the loaded queso.   My friend ordered the Baja shrimp & pollo verde tacos, along with a mezcal margarita and said every bit of it was delicious.   I ordered tacos 3 ways - al pastor, pollo verde, and carnitas, along with a pineapple margarita. The al pastor taco paired beautifully with the pineapple margarita and I quite honestly can't pick which one was my favorite.   Overall, I'd give this place a 9/10. The food and drinks were great, service was excellent, and I'll definitely be going back!

"Cafe Pontalba is convenient and passable, but better spots certainly exist. I popped in for dinner while strolling around Jackson Square, and was quickly wishing that I took the time to find one of the aforementioned better spots. I can't remember if it was the Cajun or creole combo, but it was the one with the gumbo, jambalaya, and crawfish pie. These combos certainly seem like the way to go, as they are reasonably priced and give you the opportunity to taste a few things. The gumbo was probably the highlight of the meal for me. The crawfish pie was a little weird for my taste, but was still tasty. The jambalaya is where it all fell apart. It was basically just zatarain's dirty rice with a few tiny shrimp mixed in. Dry, tasteless, and not good. I had to douse it in hot sauce to make it palatable. Any place in NOLA should at least know how to make jambalaya!

Still waiting on the insurance paperwork to come through, in which I was told I would only get .60 cents per pound. What if they broke a 5,000 dollar plate? I would get $1.20 for it?!? It's ridiculous!!! A grown man, in 1 hour used the bathroom TWICE- can you say dragging your feet?! Unforeseen costs- for tape?!? That should be included! Unprofessional- answering personal phone calls! To top everything off they accidentally drove away with my bed frame- and I had to wait 10 hours to get it back!

It's typical diner food. Service is a little lacking. The last few times we've had the same server and she always forgets something. Once she forgot we ordered wheat toast and wrote down white and last time she forgot to write down my daughters entire order of pancakes and home-fries.

Yes they give you giant portions and the staff are friendly, but the food isn't anything extraordinary.  My daughter ordered chocolate chip pancakes and they were doughy and tasted very floury and pasty.  Omelets are overloaded so if you get any sort of veggies the rest of your food is sitting in a puddle of water.  I spend more time picking the food apart into more appropriate portions than eating it and we always take tons of it home which eventually ends up in the garbage (reheated eggs are disgusting).  Maybe I need to try ordering something simple because some of their ""concoctions"" have been unappetizing.  3 stars because the staff are incredibly friendly.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

This ""billing"" company is nothing but a horrible joke, and tries to charge patients, who often don't know any better, with unfounded charges (and after researching other patient experiences, they charge for procedures that were never even done, or were done and charged through a different medical company that has already been paid through your insurance, or paid by the individual directly). I have first-hand experience dealing with this company, and they will do or say ANYTHING to anyone who has any kind of affiliation with a billable medical expense.

This hotel was interesting by far. I ordered this hotel from priceline so I received a good deal on it. LOL. I think it was $80 a night for me. It was pretty. it did not look bad. Funny but before it was a hotel it was a place where people would come and pay their water bill. So it gave you a bank experience. It look like you were entering a bank instead of a hotel.   The carpet needed cleaning. The hotel could use a few upgrades. The bathrooms were nice and especially the lighting. I took some amazing selfies while I was in there.   Unfortunately I had to call a plumber while I was there. I had a major problem with the toilet flushing. The bad part was that I had to call but the good part was when I went to the front desk to have this fixed I had someone at my hotel door in no less than ten minutes.   The pool was pretty on the pictures but I didn't get a chance to get in there because it was too cold. The overall experience was ok.

"[In the voice of Bill Lumbergh] Mm yeeeeeeeeeah I'm gonna have to uh go ahead and uh disagree with you on that.

"In a world of online ordering, it's amazing to actually be able to walk in to a store that's going to have what you need. Most electronics retailers have very little computer selection, especially beyond name brands, and good luck trying to find parts at Best Buy.  You can walk into Microcenter and walk out with everything you need to build a computer. They have a deep selection of computer parts. They also have virtually any type of cable known to man.  I bought a rare type of video cable there a few years ago. Not only did they have it, but the salesperson I asked knew exactly what I meant, where it was, and then remembered they had a returned on for half the price.  They have a large Apple section that sometimes has discounts on macs, and has specialised accessories. They frrequently have deals and sales that beat online bargains.  I bought my TV there for $800, when no one else was under $1000, and got $100 off my 360 shortly after. I've also seen them selling CPU's for well under online prices. Of I've also seen things that were overprices, so as always, caveat emptor.  The biggest downside is that their salespeople work on commission, so they can sometimes get pushy toward making a sale, or warranty plans. They at least know what they are talking about, which puts them leaps and bounds past other stores.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 4.0

"Tin Cup Coffee is a surprisingly large coffee shop for a downtown location. When I first arrived, I was relieved to have easy, and FREE, access to parking.

The actual shop. Staff: really friendly. Atmosphere: spacious. Chai tea: delicious. Prices: reasonable. Some suggestions: fill up the space a bit more with comfortable furniture. Lots of empty space that has a lot of potential. For customers, the local high school rush appears to happen around 3:30. Can get pretty busy and noisy around that time. Also, make sure to take a look at the hours. It seems they close at 5 pm during the week. I'm guessing they do events/concerts at this space which explains the amount of space and the hours.

I'm very generously pushing the 3rd star because I feel 2 is a little too harsh. Their food is okay at best. Their beef is always chewy and they seem to ALWAYS a get my order wrong even when they repeat it back to me to check and see if they wrote it correctly. When you ask for the pick two combo you have to make sure you remind them it comes with rice and soup or they won't give it to you. They're sneaky that way. I'm not impressed with their chicken at all. However their hot and sour soup is good.. When it's actually hot. & their fried rice is the best fried rice I've ever had.. And I lived in Japan for two years so that says a lot about their fried rice! (I do realize this is Chinese .. Not Japanese food.

"I have put off going to the dentist for a great many years.  I am petrified of the dentist, something about the smell, needles - everything about needles, the sound of the drill, the fact that everything is going on in such close proximity to my head, combined with a really bad childhood dental experience, just all freak me out.  Prior to going to Fleur de Lis Dental I researched every dentist within 100 miles of my home via every search engine known to man.  After months and months of research I settled upon Fleur de Lis Dental.  I picked up the phone to call them at least 10 times one day before I finally broke down and called my Mom and asked her to do it for me, I am 51 by the way.  After speaking with them, my mother is an excellent judge of character, she told me ""I think you will be comfortable and safe with this place"".   I went to my first appointment, with my mom, and also with the understanding that no one would touch me that day.  I had to mentally work myself up to that one.  When I arrived, I only waited for a moment when I was called to a conference room where I met with Dr. Aguilar and his assistant.  I was still very pensive at this point, but as I listened I became more relaxed and even let them take x-rays, a giant leap for me.  We discussed my treatment plan and I was assured that having chosen sedation dentistry there was nothing to fear.  Assured or not, I still felt a meltdown coming on before the appointment.  Finally when ""Doomsday"" came around, my good friend pried me out of my house and into the car.  By the time we arrived in Metairie, I was feeling a little better but still did not want to get out of the car.  I went into the office fully prepared with my blanket (shopped 2 weeks to find the perfect one) and my I-Phone w/Dental playlist (won't even say how long that took to create).  I recall putting crushed medicine under my tongue, I very, very, very vaguely recall Dr. Aguilar's gentle touch on my shoulder to awake me to ask me how I was doing a time or two, then the next thing I remember was being wheeled out to my car by Dr. Aguilar.  Can I just say ""WOW"", truly amazing that in the blink of an eye for me, it was over!  There went years and years of dental anxiety gone in what seemed like 60 seconds. I left that day feeling no pain but having an urgent need for Jamba Juice.  Luckily there was one nearby.  The first thing I do when handed the beverage is put the straw in.  My friend immediately says ""Whoa, no straws"", Drs. Orders.   Well, at this point I am still fully equipped with a mouth full of gauze, missing teeth and a really yummy looking fruit beverage.  My friend said I took the lid off of the Jamba Juice, then took off my sunglasses and proceeded to use the arm of my sunglasses as a spoon to shove the juice in my mouth, which I apparently could not get it in because it was full of gauze.  He said he almost lost it, driving and laughing at me try to eat!  The next day after my surgery I asked my friend why I had a Band-Aid on my arm, apparently I had an IV and did not even know it.  I have never in my 51 years had an IV before, and it was #2 on my list of fears, second only to the dentist.  Well, in summation, Fleur de Lis Dental is AWESOME.  Mere words, and I have plenty, cannot express how great they are, from the moment you walk in and are greeted at sign-in, to the moment you walk out (or are wheeled out), a total Class Act Package of kind, gentle and caring individuals.  So, if you fear the dentist and are putting off going, take a word of advice from me, and go to Fleur de Lis.",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 5.0

"Obama approved cheese steaks with a crazy long line at reading terminal!  Visited here for a second time in Philly and decided to try a ""hoagie"" as they call it in PA...(a hoagie sounds like a breed of dog to be honest)   Ordered a chicken cheesesteak for the bf because he's not a red meat eater and I got the veggie cheesesteak made of wheat gluten both with provolone. The wait was very long! But well worth it.  I highly appreciate that with each veggie order the whole grill is completely cleaned with precision and care just for one order. It took up the line for the 20 or so people behind us though. Sorry!  The service is quick! These guys work hard and fast to get every hoagie done in about 2 minutes or less! Watching the guys at the grill go makes me wonder how much they are being paid! It's a constant workout to get the cheesesteaks going!  My only reason for 3 stars aside from long wait is the flavor of my cheesesteak. I know its wheat gluten but it just taste like mushrooms(which I also had) and I wish it was some how seasoned better. Nonetheless I had to try it for the first time and feel the actual beef cheese steak would taste a lot better--but it's one of those things that you have to keep trying to look for the best of in Philly.

Tonight we went to Twistee treats as a tradition and found out it was under new ownership :( The new owners were not as friendly, the ice cream prices increased, and the size of the ice cream dramatically decreased and was less attractive.

"I had an absolutely delicious meal there 2 weeks ago with a great friend.  First, if you're a big-beer fan then Parc Brasserie is your spot.  Tons of great local craft brews as well as a huge list of Belgians.  So, we started off with the oyster appetizer - 3 varieties from around the US.  They arrived a bit late but the place was packed, in their defense.  Each oyster was chilled an deeeelicious.  Next, was a shared cheese plate.  We asked that the 'chef' choose based upon his/her best selections and we weren't sorry about that choice.

We were very excited to have a British Pub here in Tampa. We arrived early and had the place to ourselves. The had a few drinks and lunch. None of the drinks were very good and everyone was surprised by how small the portions were. The only exception was the burger. The burger was very good and of ample portions. When the women in the group complained that they were still hungry and wanted to go somewhere and get dessert because they were still hungry says something. We played some pool and had a good time but the value for the money seemed really low.,Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 2.0
"Whatchoo talking 'bout Willis? On a recent trip to CCL with Andrew S and Leslie G it was extremely pleasurable and I didn't find that anybody was snobby or rude as others have suggested. I wanted green tea, I got green tea. Life is good, right? There were two folks behind the counter, two folks I haven't seen before, and both said hello as I approached, seemed friendly and created a cool atmosphere for our group to get stuff done. No, you're not going to get lame-o drinks like you may at a national chain, but that's why CCL is cool.

The staff were friendly and welcoming, and they surprisingly had children's menus. The restaurant interior was beautifully decorated (modern coastal) and had great views of the beach. The food was wonderful! The wagyu beef skewers with shishito peppers was a delicious appetizer and generously portioned .  The sushi was fresh and gorgeously plated.

"I went here with my friend who loves their clam chowder. We've had clam chowder all over the country and I have to agree that Shell's is pretty delicious. The chowder is full of clams, along with potatoes and bacon.  I was also impressed by the shrimp and crab dip - there is a good amount of shrimp and (jumbo lump) crab mixed in with the cheese. I could have this and a cup of chowder and would be very full and satisfied.  But apparently, we are gluttons for punishment and we ordered the shrimp pasta dinner. We asked to split the dinner and when it came, they actually split the plates (and didn't charge extra.) I enjoyed this as well - very simple but the flavors were good.  Service is okay, it was a little slow but it was busy (but nothing close to the bad service described in other reviews.

"This place had the worst customer service. First time going here, looked busy so thought it would be good. You ask a server to refill a drink and they take forever making you ask them again for that refill on water.. I asked for a fork and another batch of chips and the fork took forever to get, never got the chips. Also, every Mexican restaurant I've been to, chips and salsa were on the house. This place you had to pay $9.00 for a trio dip with a basket of chips. Refills not included for chips. The server was also demanding. For tacos you cant mix and match which sucks making you get the same 4 tacos of 1 meat choice. Food was alright, I asked for hot sauce and the server goes what kind you already have some on the table. Uhm I guess that's how we talk to customers now? She doesn't give me an option of hot sauce at all. Overall, horrible customer service. No one in my party was happy with the service. We definitely won't be coming back here. There's so many other great places to eat and probably get chip and salsa on the house.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"The employees at this place are incredibly rude.  The Teryaki Chicken is okay, if not sugary sweet.  The problem however, is the process of being rushed throughout your entire meal.  Upon being seated, a menu is shoved in your face and the questions is asked, what would you like to drink?  Seconds later the drink is delivered and you are demanded to place your order.  Following this, soup and salad are put on the table.  No option for salad dressing is ever offered.  These are quite good, but one is never given time to finish.  While finishing one or both the soup and salad are removed and an entree shoved in your face.  The worst and most unsettling part is the family who runs the joint.  They shout, fight and yell across the small restaurant.  No matter where you sit, you are always in THEIR way.  Someone is always seated at a table surfing the net, looking out the window, un-boxing supplies, etc.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Let me start by saying that I would give this place only one star, but their food actually tastes good. In April we came here with some friends from out of town. THREE of our orders were sent to other tables. There is nothing more fun than trying to get your two and a half year-old and baby to sit still for three hours while the place tries to sort out your orders. Our server had no idea what was going on at all. They didn't even offer us anything more than a, ""it looks like your food was sent to another table, again"". Finally our friend spoke up and told them the needed to make it right. That's when they gave us a whopping 10% off our bill.  As if we didn't learn our lesson, we gave them a try again a few weeks ago. We arrived shortly after they opened in the hopes that it wasn't busy. We were the only people sitting at a table for the first half-hour they were open; there was only two people sitting at the bar. It took a half-hour to get our first order of food. After we received our order, we immediately gave our order sheet to the server. By that time, there were maybe five other groups of people between the bar and tables. Well, our second order got lost, it must have been delivered to another table because nobody could figure out what happened to it. So, we ordered again and it took about forty minutes for half of that order to arrive to us, the other half also miraculously disappeared. Again, we had our small children with us who behaved very well for the first hour and a half. I told the server how disappointed I was, but he didn't offer any more than a shrug of his shoulders so I asked to speak with the manager. She very irritably came over and told me she understood and our food would be coming and didn't offer any compensation for the fact that we had sat there for over two hours without getting half of our food. I asked her what she could do for me and, again, I was offered a big 10% discount on my bill. After complaining, our final order arrived fifteen minutes later (a few pieces of nigiri) and it was warm and gross. I suppose it was served out of the hostile customer section of their broken fridge? The service here is absolutely horrendous!!! I don't know if their hiring policy mandates you have to be illiterate and slow to work there, but I have never had such predictably terrible service at a restaurant in all my life. I don't think I have ever been here and eaten in less than two hours sine they opened.

"This establishment could not be more hidden.  I was familiar with this area in my youth and my truck driving days.  But 40 plus years things change and I was about as lost as one can get with a GPS.  Gribic is located at the confluence of three streets and the signage is not obvious.  I stopped my car in the middle of three streets and looked around and thought this must be the place.  Eureka!!  I was or rather the GPS was spot on.  Now knowing it is somewhat hard to find I walk in and what I expected to  see and what I saw was stunning.  Beautiful wood, table cloths, fireplace, ambiance of the first order.  The thought comes to my mind of a expecting a sow's ear and seeing a silk purse.  Gribic is one of those places that should not be visited once and say been there done that.  I saw at least 4 items I really want to try.  Their goulash and Swiss specialty being first to try followed by the veal schnitzel.  For starters I ordered the Tarhana which is a traditional soup of the Balkans; homemade sourdough noodles with ground beef and vegetables.  More simply it was a lintel soup. Darn fine soup.  I ordered the Mixed Gribic plate which consists of A mix of their finest cuts of meat grilled to perfection: Babo's chicken, Cevapi, Pljeskavica, Chicken Shish Kabob, cutlet of veal served with vegetables.  I cleaned my plate and felt like I had a wonderful Bosnian feast.  Yes Bosnian.    St. Louis has had the great privilege to be an immigration point for the people of Bosnia.

They do not always stock up on everything but they are doing an acceptable job. They have a few things that other stores don't have,  for example, sea bass ( which you don't get from other grocery stores too often).

"I was putting in a small pool and needed help sizing the pump. I went in to Leslie's as they are close by. Lori the store manager told me what I needed and sent me to the Broadway location to pick up the pump as she didn't have one.  When I attempted to install the pump I found the kit was missing a vital part,  as in not provided. So I went back to see Lori as she had sized and sold me the pump. I waited at the counter for about 10 minutes while she waited on other customers. She finally acknowledged me and I explained that there was the matter of a part not being provided. I had already done a search for it on the manufacturers website and found that they didn't sell it. She told me she was busy and would look it up and call me. Fast forward 3 days and no word from Lori. So I went back and again waited. The store was very busy. When I was finally able to get her attention, she very brusquely said she had customers to wait on and she didn't think she'd be able to take care of me. She didn't even try to help, just became dismissive, and spoke to me in a very demeaning fashion in front of other customers. Poor manners and worse customer service. I will never set foot in that store again. Andrew and Chris at the Broadway store were great, by the way.

"Hands down these folks have customer service and etiquette on the top of the list. Phenomenal dining experience. The seafood here is delicious. We enjoyed the caramelized scallops and cocktails. Main entree was another hit! The service here is just on point. They respectfully ask for your plates to be removed and you don't have to be worrying about making room for other things to be placed. It's continued throughout the night. Huge difference having other staff help the waiter/waitress throughout the course of anyone's dining experience. Coffee and wine selection is another cherry on top. Fresh roast grinder and you can tell the difference if you are a coffee snob. Overall, outstanding across the board for us. The attire is more business casual/dressy. Do not show up with casual gear or sneakers. That's not the dress code here. You'll love it for dinner.

"If I could give less than one star I would.  I recently spent several thousand dollars at this place and one of the furniture sets I purchased (a dining set) did not look right once it got into the house.  I reached out to the salesman to arrange a return.  Now you think that since I spent so much money they would have been understanding and when I called for a return they would have worked with me.  No, that was simply not the case.  Instead they swindled me out of more money by blatantly lying to my face, but I guess that's shame on me.   The salesman I worked with all but assured me that they would take back my dining set, so much that in my naivety I purchased two mattresses and box spring sets to make up for the return (basically as an exchange) without actually getting the return at the time of purchase.  One week later the salesman contacted me and told me they would not take the dining set back.  Now they got me for an extra thousand dollars.    I guess customer service and honesty is not part of dump training for their employees.  Get the customer to spend more by lying.   I've never heard of a furniture outlet that does not accept returns - sometimes what looks right on a store showroom floor does not look right in the actual house.

"Irish themed restaurant right across the street from Moriarty's.  Perfect area to grab food before a show at Walnut Street Theatre!  It was less crowded than most restaurants in the area, so we got a table right away.    The food was awesome and packed big flavor for a small place.  I had the Shepherd's Pie, which was layered with mashed potatoes, veggies, ground beef, and gravy.  Topped with a generous portion of cheese and baked until crisp.  It was one of the better versions of the dish I've had!  My sister got the potato soup for an appetizer, which was also really great.  It was thick and creamy, resembling more of a chowder.  She and my cousin got the walnut street salad, with grilled chicken, candied walnuts, craisins, and apples.  Another tasty menu option!  The prices were extremely fair, seeing as it was only $75 for five meals, an appetizer, and three glasses of house wine.

"I was in the Philadelphia area and I met a friend for dinner. She was craving Mexican and we ended up here ....  The inside looks like a cheesy chain restaurant, Chi-Chi's comes to mind. They don't take reservations for parties under 8, I don't know if that is a negative or a positive, considering the place was pretty dead when I went there on a weekend.  The food is completely Americanized-Mexican food. The margarita tasted nothing like a margarita (not good when your restaurant is named 'Las Margaritas'), my chimichanga (that the server told me was the best thing on the menu) had AMERICAN cheese melted on it. Very bizarre. My friend had quesadillas and she said she had the same issue with the cheese.  I was not sold in the least on this place. But, I will say this: service was very nice and prices were extremely cheap. They actually had a pretty busy bar scene at one point of the evening.

"As for people complaining about price gouging, they're a gun store and a PAWN SHOP. Go to another pawn shop and see what kind of better deal you will get pawning a gun. That's the way it works. Don't like the price they offer? Don't pawn or sell a gun.   As for one person said on here about the price of .22lr ammo being too high, I would agree. But they are not tthe only ones charging high prices. Again, dont like the price, don't buy them. If they sold the brick of .22 for $25, that person would most likely turn around and sell it for twice that much. That seems to be what people are doing, hence Buckhorn's price for the .22 ammo  I've been dealing with these guys for a long time. They don't have the biggest selection as other gun stores but they do know what they are talking about and their service is great. Very personable and easy to talk to.

"tl;dr: Really not worth it.  I used to enjoy Sushi on the Rocks despite their horrible service, but it's impossible to go here without some minor to major customer service fiasco anymore. Their host staff are among the most rude you'll find in the city (and really not that bright) and a majority of their waitstaff is completely incompetent. For the last three times I've been here, I've gotten something free because our food took so long (and I didn't ask for it, the servers seem conditioned to just comp drinks because it's so common).  I tried to go back on a Saturday night after making a reservation online and I was informed by the hostess that they've been booked for a couple days so our reservation wasn't even put on the list. I told her that their website should reflect that reservations made online basically mean nothing, or that they should at least call people and let them know if they won't be able to be seated at all. She scowled and told me she ""doesn't run the website."" Of course you don't, you're a hostess. But the business you represent is doing a poor job giving you the tools you need to service customers. Having come from a customer service background where the website of my business totally screwed me over, I was floored by her lack of empathy (insincere or not, I'm not picky).   SOTR has a good angle going for them. They've got ok sushi (and a couple of really great rolls), a trendy environment, and prime location. However, I just can't keep going here and being treated so poorly. There is better, cheaper sushi elsewhere in the city that doesn't take 45 minutes to get after dealing with grumpy staff.  SOTR - seriously, get with the freakin' program. I was such a huge fan and advocate for you. Train your staff better and hire someone to do your website permanently (and take off the online reservation system). Besides the functionality issues, it looks horrible and outdated all the time.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"This spot was recommended to me by a good friend, after stating that I wanted to eat brunch the next morning. Let me tell you that it was well worth the drive from the mainland to North Redington Beach. Why you may ask ? well let start with the staff The staff had the most upbeat, personal and caring attitudes I have ever seen at any establishment and I am not speaking of one employee im speaking of all employees. The minute I walked in the door I was greeted by big smiles and happy attitudes. This is what I believe makes or breaks a business and this place has mastered it.  The food, oh my good the food. I had the Breakfast brunch buffet, and for $12.99 you have a large variety of food. They had grits, corn beef hash, cheesy potatoes, eggs, bacon sausage, waffles, French toast, biscuit and gravy, yogurt, fruit, toast, all unlimited so eat until you are stuffed, I went back for thirds. They have coffee both regular and flavored. They also had mimosas for $4 for those of us who enjoy a little champagne and OJ to start the day. Trust me you will not be disappointed because everything taste so good.  Parking seems to be very limited at least what I could see when I pulled in, there where maybe 15- 20 spots again I didn't drive around so there might have been more somewhere else. The place is popular especially for Sunday brunch, I happened to get there around 9:30am and had to wait about 15 minutes to be sat down, but when I walked out after eating the wait was more like and hour people sat on every seat and more where standing just waiting to get in and enjoy.  The decor is very beachy, colorful and fun. you will be entertained by all the funny plaques hung through the establishment. The have both indoor and outside seating. The outside is very tropical in nature the inside seating is very small but still cute and amazing.

I was happy to see a couple vegetarian items on the menu but was sad that it was only a veggie burger and the General Tso's Tofu. we got the tofu and it was delicious, there was a lot of flavor to it. I also ordered strawberry cheesecake for dessert and it was not like any cheesecake I've ever had. more of a cake with strawberry frosting on top. it was weird. my fiance had the canoli and said they were awful. Service was great until it got a little busy, as it usually does on a friday night, and we missed out on our last round of drinks. at least we didn't get charged for them, even though we ordered them. all in all, I would go back for drinks and maybe more if they add a few more veggie options but I wouldn't go for the dessert.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 3.0

"Here's how I'm feeling about these folks. Went there two weeks ago 4/22/17 to see what they had, which to say the least was extremely overwhelming.  The pricing seemed reasonable so we made the purchase (keep in mind it's a small powder room that's being done). Now here is my frustration. When we made the purchase, templating was occurring on 4/28 with install to occur 5/6.  I get two phone calls on 5/4 from the salesman asking that we come see the remnant selected for the job which requires approval and the install will now occur on 5/11/17.  I called the salesman back left a voicemail advising I was actually quite annoyed that they are getting back to me two days before the original install of 5/6 now advising the install has to be moved.  When I talk to him on the phone & in person, he gives me some story that they were having trouble finding a suitable remnant and that's why they were just contacting me.  Now they had over a week to find a remnant for us to see and approve which would've allowed them to prepare and have the install done for 5/6.

It's very loud, cliquey, and can be quite uncomfortable at times. The hostesses are never very polite, and the last time I was there I got something called the ""buffalo chicken soup"". Wow, absolutely atrocious. It wasn't even soup, it was just the buffalo sauce that drips off a buffalo chicken cheesesteak. Two bites and I was gagging. The seating arrangements also leave much to be desired. You're cramped in like sardines on the main floor. Maggie's used to be fun and actually have edible food. There used to be hostesses that would acknowledge your presence and bartenders that would serve good drinks. Sadly, that is no longer the case. So, if you're looking for barely edible food and loud drunken ""bro's"" screaming at a tv screen while you try to talk to the person you came there with, by all means, enjoy.

"FINALLY! One of my favorite Orlando fast casual spots Sus Hi Eatstation lands in Tampa! Near the USF area, Sus Hi Eatstation opened during the pandemic and is still serving our area in a tasty, safe and responsible way. You can order by walk-up, calling ahead, or ordering through their phone app. The employees were gracious and quick to work. The inside of the dining area is wonderfully decorated with a ninja theme, with bar seating along the walls. I can't wait until we can dine in again. For now, the husband and I ordered take-out.  Sus Hi Eatstation offers a variety of fast casual sushi and small bite options. They have custom bowls, rolls and sushi burritos, or you can order something pre-set from the menu. They even have mini nori burritos if you want a sushi roll appetizer before your main course sushi!  The most decadent way to order your sushi...is to DEEP. FRY. IT! You can get regular rolls deep fried or get a behemoth sushi burrito deep fried! I ordered the ""Fry Me a River"" sushi burrito, which includes white rice, salmon, tuna, spicy krab, cream cheese, avocado, edamame beans, purple cabbage, cucumber, scallions, carrots, sesame seeds, triple x and wasabioli. You can also make adjustments to menu items; I switched out the triple x spicy sauce for the spicy mayo. The outside of the burrito doesn't get too hard when they fry it. It gives an extra texture to the fresh burrito and elevates the fried sushi concept.  My husband created a custom roll. The ingredients tasted fresh and you really get a fair amount of food for the price. We ordered a mini nori roll for our parents who don't normally eat sushi, but they enjoyed their order. The mini nori roll yields 6 pieces and can be quite filling for the occasional sushi eater.  I highly recommend Sus Hi Eatstation to anyone in the area! Although it's a chain, it's owned by a wonderful family who give back to the communities in all of their central Florida locations. They also have a lot of fun in their social media videos.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Having not eaten at The Egg in years, I'd forgotten how long the wait and good the food can be.  Our experience was pleasant, our parting was a bit less so...  The mixed crowd waited in droves.  Hanging off the concrete balcony and slouched in every available waiting room seat.  We were told ""20 minutes"" and it was, exactly, a 20 minute wait.  I applaud the hosting staff on their ability to predict--a rarity in the world of restaurants.  I was not as happy with one particular hostess's show of preference.  I requested a glass of water while waiting and while she agreed to bring me one, it never came.  Five minutes later, a very good looking younger man requested a glass of water.  The hostess retrieved it with immediacy.  I swooped in as she was handing it to him and said, ""That's mine, right?""  Oooohhh, was she mad.  I ruined that little love-connection.  Soon after, we were sat.    Our waitress was adorable, honest, and quick!.  She suggested the specials, vetoed something she thought rank, and brought us a pitcher of tea and a pitcher of water.  We were happy.  Both Matt and I opted for the buffalo chicken sandwich special:  Two grilled chicken breasts with a delicious sweet coleslaw, tossed in buffalo sauce and served with a mini-bowl of salad and a slice of delicious dill pickle.  It hit the brunchy spot!  Gustavo had the Mexicali burro with grilled chicken.  At first look, he was a little freaked out upon delivery.  The vibrant orange of the florescent tortilla really had his Mexican blood boiling.  But, he gave it a go and ended up thinking it delicious.  He said a few hours ago: ""I'd really like another one...  The burro was filled with spinach, grilled onions and peppers, potatoes (he thinks...)  and a light, tangy salsa.  It was served with savory spiced black beans and topped off with guacamole and sour cream.  I didn't even get to try a bite!  We ate, we drank, the server brought us to go drinks and we were on our way out, walking by the kitchen when I heard someone therein exclaim ""lets try and keep track of all of the flies that attack us today!"" And, a lot of familiar laughter.  I was disgusted.  Nothing like ruining a good meal...  Maybe reel in that extra chatter management.  I'm not certain I want to share a kitchen with insects in such quantity that they deserve their own peanut gallery...",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Not sure exactly what it has to do with homes, but loved the free beer samples from Yards on the way in!  Beyond that, the show wasn't all that impressive.  It was set-up on the 1st floor of the convention center, yet was still far from packed (with vendors, etc).  They had some fully designed rooms to vote on (my vote went to the Alice in Wonderland theme), they had their share of kitchen and bathroom re-do options, and they had a ton of people wanting to come out to your house to evaluate your windows.  Even talking with a few of the vendors, I was in and out in less than an hour.  Not sure the cost of tickets since a friend (Jared J) hooked me up with a free one, but can't imagine a cost I'd agree to pay for this show.  Did see on the website that they had free parking/shuttle service from IKEA which is nice.

We ordered two fried chicken sandwiches, both in the hot honey with fries. My recommendation is always to upgrade to their fries, they're amazing!

"On a recent weekend on Mt Lemmon, we decided to spend the morning having breakfast at Iron Door, and then riding the chair lift. An unexpected surprise was that breakfast entrees included a lift ticket ($15), so we lucked out.  We were one of maybe 5 groups that all arrived right as the restaurant opened. They brought us in quickly, and we took seats on the patio, well distanced. The staff made it clear masks were required everywhere but at the table, which I appreciated.  Our server was new, and clearly didn't know the menu. But we were able to order. Our drinks came quickly and the coffee was excellent.    Unfortunately I can't say the same of the food. We waited a LONG time for our meal - so long that not only did everyone who came in around the same time get served long before us, most were done eating and had left before our food arrived.  The food seemed to have been sitting a bit - not cold, but also not piping hot.  I had eggs, home fries (that were actually shredded hash browns) and a brat. Eggs were the requested temperature, but the brat desperately needed some grilling - it was cooked through but gray and floppy. Which was similar to my spouse's potato pancakes. Even with the food being delayed, the streusel didn't come out with the meal. It arrived with ice cream that we'd asked them to leave off, but the spiced peach flavor was lovely.  There aren't a ton of options on the mountain, so I'm sure I'll be back for another try. They get the broad strokes (coffee! beer! great German menu!) right, but tweaking the actual cooking and serving could make this place amazing.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 2.0

"We stayed a week at the hotel.   The only positive I would have for the Wyndham Garden Clearwater is the housekeeping staff and the beds, which were quite comfortable.  The food was good, but it did not rate the five-star prices that were charged.  The first night was the Fourth of July and we were welcomed by rampant drunks and an appearance by two of Clearwater's finest. The hotel was old and overpriced for the condition. Over the course of the week, the elevator got stuck 3 times (thankfully we were only witnesses, not victims).  The stairs do not take you to the first floor lobby, so we were pretty much forced to take the elevator even though our room was on the second floor. The bar was terrible.  The drinks were way overpriced.  An 18% gratuity was added, which I truly believe made the staff not care about providing a decent level of service.  One night, I sat at the bar for 15 mins before the bartender tore herself away from the cash register inside to serve me.  I wouldn't have minded, but there were only 4 people sitting at the bar!  When you ate at the restaurant, it was not uncommon to wait forever for drink refills or the check.  The bartenders tended to want to chat up their family and other locals who tended to hangout at the bar, rather than serving the paying hotel guests.  One bartender charged us $9.00 for a glass of wine and then yelled to a local ""Hey!  You're a local, so you get happy hour prices all the time.""  They also high-pressure pushed overpriced Florida craft beers and did not ever keep any low-carb beers on hand.  I hate low carb beers, but I'm a diabetic so I usually have no problem getting Michelob Ultra from a bar. The beach was not on the Gulf.  It was on the channel between the inland waterway and the Gulf.  It was okay, considering this, but boats carrying the aforementioned locals tended to pull into the small swimming areas to party at the hotel and hang out with the bartenders who were much happier to serve them than those annoying hotel guests. This was my first and my last stay at a Wyndham hotel.  I will go back to a Marriott or Hilton affiliate.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 2.0
"Service was very friendly and efficient.  Restaurant was very clean and appointed nicely.  Menu read well,  but the execution was off. The gumbo sounded great; the nicely rouxed seafood gumbo was totally overpowered by an extremely overly-horseradished potato salad center.  A nice concept to serve in lieu of rice,  but the horseradish dressing killed the gumbo. Swing and a miss. We also ordered the scallop dish.  The scallops were unfortunately full of sand. The sous vide then pan sauteed fingerlings that accompanied the scallops were finished with saffron: another unnecessary added flavor that confused a simple dish.  Seems that all across the menu,  the kitchen wanted to add unnecessary flourishes which never let the food speak for itself.   The mussels with lemongrass were flavorless. The highlight of the meal were the frites that came with the mussels. Very sad for the price we paid.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 2.0

Salads, once again a step above most places about Nashville/Franklin Desserts (they are true -masters- of cake, muffins and cookies) Music (best relaxing music around) Owners super friendly, and knowledgeable  Cons: At times a little slow, food is worth it, but if in a hurry, might wanna consider calling in your order Chairs/tables are not the most comfortable in the world... not horrible, just not great either.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Sunday=Dim Sum, YUM  There's nothing like sitting at a table with a group of friends enjoying Sunday morning dim sum.  When we arrived we were seated immediately at a table, the hot tea arrived quickly and the carts were coming around in no time.  My personal favorites were the Chinese broccoli, baked barbecue pork bun, and of course all of the dessert items.  The best way to enjoy your dim sum is with a larger group of people.  There are so many items coming around on those carts that you are really doing yourself a disservice if you don't have enough people to spit the portions.  Although some items are 3 pieces per plate (eg. buns) they are happy to split portions by cutting them up into smaller pieces.  Also, if you don't know what something is it won't be a big deal because you'll only have to eat a bite or two and then it will be gone.

"I don't want to pile on the rest of the bad reviews but this place does deserve it.  First and biggest complaint, the website has a large and interesting menu, with specials of the day, we arrived on a Friday night that was called ""Steak Night"".  No steaks on the menu and definitely not steak night.  But what they do have is a lovely patio with views of the golf course.  There was a grill with a limited menu cooked outside.  Nice atmosphere, seemed like a hit with the kids.  We chose to dine inside, where an older crowd of golfers seemed to be enjoying cocktails. When asked about the menu discrepancy the waitress noted that the menu had been scaled back for the summer, because of the outside grill, she recommended the kielbasi.  I ended up ordering the burger with a baked potato on the side.  Burger was a hockey puck, cooked medium, which made me happy, though I wasn't asked.  It came on a crumbling bun with lettuce tomato and onion.  Really not too bad for $5, the potato was undercooked and the butter did not even melt.  Partner had the Pig Mac, a pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese on Texas toast.  Passable, but wouldn't order it again.  It came with homemade, crisp, but undersalted chips.  Service was pretty good, the waitress had addressed our concerns about the inaccuracy of the website with the manager.  Just disappointed.

"Don't get me wrong; the food here is fantastic. that gets 5 stars. thats not why I'm writing this review. In March, I made a fundraiser event scheduled with Deptford Chipotle for the first weekend in May. all was well. 2 weeks later they called and said that weekend didn't work (cinco de mayo weekend) so they asked if we could reschedule for June 7. I was flexible and said that was fine because it was still before the date of the Relay for Life we were fundraising for, which is on June 13. On Sunday, May 31 (one week prior) I called to confirm with the manager because I hadn't received event flyers from them. The manager CONFIRMED with me. I thought confirmed meant ""confirmed"", like any other person would. Today, 15 MINUTES prior to my fundraiser start, they called to tell me that they had erased our American Cancer Society event from their calendar tonight. I JUST confirmed last week with them and now we are ""out of their system"". I understand accidents happen, but when I called a week ago I was told it was good to go. All they said was ""sorry, we can do June 28th for you though"", which is later than the date of the actual Cancer Walk that the whole fundraiser was for! I wish that who I spoke to there was more accommodating to me, perhaps held the fundraiser at some point this WEEK, especially because it is for a great cause. ""Sorry"" doesn't fix it, and I ALREADY CHANGED THE EVENT DATE FOR YOU GUYS! I will not be using this Chipotle again for another fundraiser of any kind, even though they were great to us for last year's fundraiser. It's completely ridiculous.

I have to believe that this new location probably looks quite different, as it is brand spanking new in 2021.

I don't remember it being as expensive as it is, I will admit. The 6oz pour of house wine is still more than $10 and the entrees were all $24+ for dinner. The pear gorgonzola pizza was a  nice nosh, it's a relatively thin crust with a good chew. It's cooked in a woodfire and that makes all the difference.   This is a really tasty restaurant. And Italian is a total crowd pleaser, so definitely a win.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0
"While in town we had heard from our tour driver about a Monday night fried chicken special and then I had read on the local paper's website a glowing recommendation to give it a try.  There was no way I wasn't going to get in here.  It started if I recall correctly, about 5 pm.  Still being early we were able to get in and get seated quickly.  Lucky for us, as it started to fill in.  A great setting in an old school classic hotel, a live pianist, and the best fried chicken I've ever had with sides (red beans & rice, coleslaw, biscuits) for $18.93 a person.  Uh YEAH...  The whole operation is classy.  The decor, the cocktails, the attentive staff.  It is a full-service restaurant serving breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner with some specials sprinkled throughout the week.  If they are as good as the chicken, then they're fantastic.  It was a great place to spend some quiet time with my wife and had some good food.  Its inside the Roosevelt Hotel and another oasis from the chaos that can overwhelm you in New Orleans.  Stop in for a drink.  Try some food.",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 5.0
"I usually have a good experience here so I called the previous day and made an appointment for 9:30 am...right when they open so I should have been one of the first appointments. First time making an appointment here but assumed an appointment meant that I would have a nail tech ready to get started on my nails when I arrived. When I walked in there were 3 ladies before me so they took them back...fine, they could have had 9:30 appointments as well. But there were only 3 technicians. So I proceeded to wait. It wasn't until 15 minutes after my appointment time that I was even invited back to a chair. Meanwhile, a woman who walked in after me was immediately taken back to a chair (actually she walked herself back and the staff seemed to know her). I'm guessing she had an appointment with the way she acted but that was another person who went before my appointment. Now I'm currently sitting in a pedicure chair...it's past 10 am and I have yet to begin my appointment. The 4 other ladies around me are being taken care of while I wait. Don't get me wrong...I don't usually make appointments so I'm usually fine with waiting but I specifically made an appointment because I have other appointments after this. If a 5th 9:30 appointment wasn't available, then they should have told me that over the phone when I scheduled. I suppose that is the biggest disappointment with this experience...making an appointment has been no different than being a walk in.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 3.0

"I just moved to the area and I was looking for a nail place to call my own. I stumbled across Zazen, based on Yelp reviews, and was immediately hooked. It exuded everything that I love about nail salons back home in Atlanta. It looked sophisticated, clean, and people raved about the customer service. I was excited when I made my appointment. I'm setting this all up because I need y'all to know that I really really wanted to like Zazen and I simply did not. As I stated before I'm brand new to this area; this one way street with limited parking enviroment is not something I am accustomed to. I called and let them know that I was figuring out where to park. I asked where the best place to park would be and the young girl on the phone said, "" We have street parking. Hurry up."" And so began my experience with Zazen.   I walked in determined not to let the curt tone of the receptionist deter me from a relaxing nail experience. She showed me to my seat and gave me the nail colors. When she brought my tea I asked her if there was a nude color with pink undertones that she could recommend. She responded curtly (again, she's so great at that) that my nail tech would be here soon and tell me. Okay, so it was clear this girl wasn't going to be my buddy and I should drop the southern hospitality.   My nail tech, Rosa, was so great. She was super nice and gentle with my nails. She entertained my indecisiveness with the nail colors and made sure I liked the color when she appied it to the first finger. I appreciated that. It really is the little things that cement good customer service for me. She gave me a hand massage which was just divine and I felt as though she took good care of my nails and hands. When I went up to pay with my card I added that I wanted to put a tip on the receipt and sharply told that tips were only accepted in cash. I reiterated that I would like to tip my wonderful nail tech and the curt receptionist obliged. Just a note: if someone is new to the salon there's a good chance that they have no idea Zazen only accepts cash tips. So an attiude at the invisible inconvenice of having to tip off of a card is completely uneccessary.   Unfortunately, my issues with Zazen go beyond the young rude receptionist. The gel job I got done quickly deteriorated. I have a busy lifestyle which is why I always get gels done. These, however, were just not up to par. My nails chipped in two days. That doesn't even happen to me with shellac or a regular polish! Also, the color was cheap. It adopted a green hue and when I asked another manicurist about this (I immediately went somewhere else to get those wretched things off) she informed me that this happens with polish of poor quality that is put under UV light. I'm not fond of shelling out money for poor quality things.   Other people came here and lucked out with the polish or weren't subjected to rude employees and seemed to have a wonderful experience. That's great! However, I came here and experienced medicore quality in service and polish. Is Zazen worth trying again? Is a second time the charm? No, not at all.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 2.0

"I have been a client at Vanity for over 10 years. Ed, the owner, has cut and colored my hair through the years. It is almost impossible to find words to say how great my experiences have been! During my lifetime I have been to many different salons in the Philadelphia area and New York City(even those touted in the fashion magazines), and Vanity is superior to them all. The desk employees are always welcoming and cheerful - there is NO attitude in this salon.  Everyone truly wants the patrons to be comfortable and happy. The salon has always been beautiful and clean  - now extreme measures  have been taken to insure safety during Covid, and I absolutely feel that the protocols instituted are successful.  Masks, partitions, social distancing and meticulous cleaning are the order of the day.  In the last few years, Ed has cut my hair into the perfect long shag with bangs - Ed's bangs are always amazing.  My brunette hair color has been enhanced with baby lights and balayage that I have loved. Recently, I let my silver hair grow in over quarantine. Ed skillfully blended any demarcation with perfectly placed silver highlights- not an easy task! The end result was fabulous.  I highly recommend the process to anyone who wants to transition to silver and does not want to go ""cold turkey"". Ed brings his vast knowledge of coloring to the process and the results are pure ""genius""!  I also have heard wonderful things about other staff members - and all of the assistants are excellent. If you want skill, understanding, patience, great cut and color, keratin, etc., PLUS SAFETY -   you must see Ed and his talented staff at Salon Vanity!",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 5.0

Dad tried the Pasta Fresca with Shrimp.   This was after I asked if the Japanese Pan Noodles could be made without the ""spicy"" part, and they said no.   He really liked his dish, and I liked it, too.  I had my usual, the Pesto Cavatappi with pulled pork.  It tasted great and was just the right temperature.   The only trouble I encountered with it was three big pieces of the pulled pork were just fat.   I'm glad I was watching as I ate.  We went later than the usual lunch crowd, so the restaurant was pretty empty.   Service was friendly, especially the young man who brought our food to the table.

My partner had a grilled chicken sandwich with cheese and spinach and he said it was great.  I had the pork entree, which was exceptional.  The best pork I've ever had.  It was cooked with apples, maple-glazed brussel sprouts (OMG! so good), baked beans and mashed sweet potatoes.  It was to die for.   Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the beer and the food.

"This is a ""yelp update"" but it's also a story about New Orleans, the passion and painstaking care and love you'll find in the food here, and the people who make that happen to bring you experiences you'll never forget.   I wrote a previous review about a bad delivery order from Cochon Butcher, a long-winded rant about greasy wings. Ultimately, looking back, I realize that to really experience great food - you should get it at the restaurant itself.  I digress. Zack Shelton, head of management, emailed me to tell me about how much the feedback about the food means to him, and went over every detail about what had most likely happened and what I SHOULD have gotten. He offered to personally re-deliver the original meal (Butcher Hot Wings and pickled celery with ranch and a beverage, their take on an Alabama Slammer), or in the case if I wasn't local, to send me a smoked wing package, OR to refund my entire order. And then on top of that, asked me if there was anything else I wanted!?! Unheard of.*  Of course I had to give the food another try, and I am currently eating the best wings I've had since I can remember - perfectly crisp and seasoned, not greasy, the pickled celery on the side is delightful, and my drink is AMAZING. A complete 180 from what had apparently happened during the delivery (which was mainly due to the food sitting too long). Also, I think I need to try everything on the menu now because I am so impressed. Zack's commitment to the food is just one of so many examples of why New Orleans is the best city in the United States.   *To reiterate: If you are a decent person you will not complain about the food here just to get Zack (who is very pleasant and charming) to personally deliver you a re-do.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 5.0

This company is a joke, and will tell you when you decide to cancel a shipment because of how horribly their employees and the drivers they contracted with on your shipment that you will owe them more for the return fee than they originally state to all of their prospective customers. For you and your sanity's sake, here is a fair warning to NOT choose this company for any of your shipping needs. Shady business with disrespectful customer service representatives who will go as far as blaming the numerous shipment and contact delays on you, then just sit there and tell you you're wrong as you read their own words off their website to them. If you do use them, good luck and hopefully it works out for you, but don't go into it with even the average expectations. Horrible business and extremely disorganized in handling other people's items they've paid a lot of money to ship. One last thing before this vent session is over: When they say 30 day period from time of quote/purchase to shipment, that parties will receive calls from the drivers, etc...they mean the drivers they choose to use will not be calling you, will not return calls, that the company itself will not return or take calls, will not call you back as they said they would, that your shipment will be delayed several weeks and multiple times, and so on.

The bar and venue area are smartly separated, which creates similarly distinct vibes.

Haven't been to venue side when there has been a performance, but the size is good, and there seems to be enough acts to accommodate a variety of tastes.  Beer selection is commendable and rotates, which is a plus for any and all beer snobs.  My only gripe would be the newness of the place, which causes the atmosphere to seem stiff at times with a lack of patrons that can consciously create the sensation of emptiness.

"Had the sausage and pepper skillet and it was not good at all. The gravy was gross. It was clear and watery looking to the point I didn't even realize that was gravy in the skillet at first. The peppers were raw and I didn't eat anymore of them after realizing that. I was thinking of sending it back, but I was with my parents and we waited forever for our food so I opted to at least eat the eggs, sausage, and potatoes and some of the dry biscuit that came with it. I'm honestly grossed out I ate the gravy though and regret it. It looked like some type of instant powder gravy or something because I could see tiny specs in it like it was some powder mixed in it which is kind of  concerning now that I think more about it. Hopefully I don't get sick. I give it a couple of days until I'm in the clear. I would recommend Cracker Barrel over their gross gravy. At least their country gravy is hearty and good. Guess that's what I get for trying a new mom and pop type of place. Definitely won't be coming back if that dish is any representation of the rest of their menu.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I've been here twice, and both times I was unimpressed.   The atmosphere isn't too bad, mostly happy hour seekers from the immediate area, and both times it's been pretty crowded (read, difficult to find a seat or talk). The wait staff is pleasant enough, though not particularly attentive.  They have a decent selection of beer, but I've as yet to be blown away by anything I've had there (and there scotch selection leaves something to be desired, which may not be important to you, but it always is to me).   The food seems like your standard, frozen, reheated/fried pub food, which is overpriced and a little unsatisfying.**  Basically, if you're in the neighbourhood and everything else is too crowded to get a table, this place will do, because it's so mediocre that you're unlikely to have a truly horrific experience. It's serviceable, but if you're looking for something to really ""make"" your evening, find another joint.  ** The chef contacted me and would very much like me to point out that ""an important fact that [I am] omitting is that [they] don't even HAVE a freezer in [his] kitchen and NOTHING comes in frozen."".... That is a fair statement. So, I guess my review should read that it *seems* like standard frozen, reheated pub food... But it isn't.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Friday night ""Happy Hour.""  Don't ask the bartender what the deal is for Happy  Hour.  She will, in a tone that certainly indicates how annoying it is to be asked such a thing, direct you to certain ""pages"" in the little menu notebook.    HH food choices are weak.   We ask for ice water to begin, and get one glass.   Order drinks.  Beer was barely cold, margarita was okay.  Order the ""sliders"" off of the ""late night"" menu.   They are served on a cutting board with lettuce, tomato and pickled onions.  And horseradish mayo (or something) poured directly onto the cutting board.  And that's fine.  However, server did not bring any plates for sharing, nor did he ask if we needed any.  Once we got one of the bartender's attention, she made a big deal about ""finding plates somewhere.""  It's a restaurant.  It's a common item. Shouldn't be that hard.     So we dig into the food.  Flavor is okay, but the meat on the sliders had a ton of fat.   For $11.00, you can get much better in Tucson.    Nothing was particularly good about the experience.  Uninspired bartenders who seemed to not care whether customers were there or not, and so-so food.  Just not a good vibe in any category.  We were going to leave before we got our drinks, but weren't quick enough and the drinks arrived.  We won't be going back.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 1.0

"""Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'""  My ""Journey"" to Edmonton brought six of us here for dinner last night.  La Ronde sure is like a big wheel in the sky, turning ever so slowly as it revolves to give you a tremendous 360 degree panorama of Edmonton.   It's on the 24th floor of the Chateau Lacombe Hotel and revolves once every 88 minutes. The dining tables are set up on the outer ring of the circular restaurant, so every table is right on the glass wall overlooking the city.   The view through the restaurant's glass walls is wonderful, and we found it to be an appropriate match to the outstanding service and excellent food we found inside those glass walls.     We asked our server what his favorite menu choices were and he said La Ronde is noted for it's Prime Rib and Baked Arctic Char. My table overwhelmingly went for the beef choices, and the Prime Rib, Bison Tenderloin, Mignonettes of Alberta Beef all looked amazing. One of our dining companions went for the Caesar Salad (#12 Small or $14 Large) that drew a lot of attention because it looked so good - two giant wedges of Romaine lettuce served with a ""Prosciutto Chip"" as big as your phone, plus a prodigious amount of shaved asiago.  I ordered the Charbroiled Alberta AAA Striploin ($42) https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=hyB7Kp8kxXTJVTTqcIpIIw&userid=cVrM2BvOvPV0Vi_rC8kepQ served with a ""five peppercorn and mushroom sauce and trio of mashed potatoes"". It also came with an unadvertised side of vegetables -baby carrots, green beans and a red pepper wedge.  The steak was great- full of flavor and very tender. In fact, everything on my plate was great! I loved the sauce, the vegetables, and the potatoes. There were three piped mounds of different mashed potatoes, I believe they were sweet, regular mashed, and a cheese flavored version.  I split a dessert -the Baked Alaska ($12) - https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=G7SnvuU37RH26RJlhJCzeg&userid=cVrM2BvOvPV0Vi_rC8kepQ How does this menu description sound? ""Blood Orange and Caramel Ice Cream, Chocolate Crumble, with Ice Wine Foam"". Yeah, I thought you'd like that. It was big enough to share easily and was a fitting way to end our meal.

"Bottom Line; This is a great spot to take in a game, have a few beers and a burger.  Just as long as you are cool with bar food.  I took my dad here for fathers' day because he really seems to like this spot.  Having grown up in SB I have the shame to admit that I've only been here a few times but I'm always willing to try pretty much anything.     The lady serving us was very nice and very helpful and we had 6 at our table - she did a nice job for sure.     Dad and I both ordered burgers, the wife had a sandwich, mom had a sandwich and the little one had chicken tenders.      The burgers aren't bad for sure, they just aren't amazing.  I wish they had something else besides 1/3 lb or bigger.  There are just those days when you want more condiment than patty.      Onion rings and fries were great - cant go wrong there.        The wife wasnt crazy about the sandwich, I ate half of it (which I certainly should NOT have after eating my entire burger) which wasnt bad at all, again just not amazing.

I love the calzone. Their tiramisu is better than even at pricier restaurants. And for parties (birthday, sports, etc.), there really is no place better.  But it's the attention that you get that makes it such a great place. I've been in many restaurants in Bellevue, with a lot of visits to each place. Only the owner of Pizza Perfect has taken note of us, and says hi to us in public. I'll be honest: even if the food was mediocre I'd go simply because of that level of customer appreciation.

Earlier this summer, I opted for one each of the fancy donuts which included: cookies & cream, blueberry muffin, sticky bun, chocolate peanut butter, banana cream pie, and white chocolate peach.  My tastebuds were in heaven with every bite of each donut.  The banana cream pie donut may actually be the best donut I have ever had.    With the high bar the delectable donuts set, I was amazed at how the chicken was just as good.  I've tried the buttermilk ranch and chili-garlic chicken thus far and both were the best chicken I have ever had.

A nice airing out, dusting and an air cleaner would fix this, I think, but lets go back to the other side of the store... where the half wall protects the other side where you eat from the dust bowl. *walks 3 feet to the other side...*  With the door opening right there near your table the fresh air & the fan/exhaust circulation from the kitchen makes it a very pleasant place to sit as you eat. If it was warmer I would have sat outside to look at the beautiful park.  Location: This cafe has wonderful outdoor seating that looks over the lovely Lafayette park.

"We found this venue online when it was just a sketched photo on a random search engine. When we visited 14TENN, it was completely under construction in the dead of winter with obviously no heat or electricity. We bundled up in coats and scarves, and walked around the empty construction site at night with our iPhone flashlights  14TENN only consisted of some raw wood, a few original beams and a wonderful owner named Sean, who had no staff hired in Nashville yet. But we knew we HAD to get married there. We could see their vision and it matched ours. BEST DECISION EVER. I mean look at this place. And their customer service.. Over the top!! I could go on for days. Just know, the insanely beautiful space is just the icing on the cake. It's the people there that make this place what it is.   Which leads me to our wedding coordinator Kaitlynn Montgomery. An angel in human form. This girl, y'all. I messaged her at least once a week with another ridiculous idea. And she encouraged me on every single one of them. Anyone who knows me knows how annoyingly Type A I am and how I prefer to do things myself and plan every detail to nauseam. Kaitlynn took SO much off my plate. If I asked her about something or suggested something, she had already taken care of it 3 days prior. She was always 5 steps ahead of me at all times. She single handily took my stress level down 1,000 notches on a daily basis. Every single last detail or idea that we came up with for this wedding would absolutely have never been possible without Kaitlynn. She brought it all to life. And Ellyse.. Her and Kaitlynn worked their butts off together on our wedding day and it was perfect. Every time I saw Ellyse that day, she was smiling ear to ear and it immediately put my nerves at ease. These two girls are just the absolute sweetest and SO freaking good at their jobs.   Now, one of the most important guy of the night... Our alcohol and bar concierge, Hunter!! I remember calling him one day thinking, he is going to kill me and I'm about to make him hate his job  I was like, So I was thinking about cocktail hour and how it would be cool to serve hand-crafted blueberry mojitos named after our dog in 150 coconut cups with stir sticks that have our dog's face on them. Oh and I want them all displayed on shelves with signs and the whole works. He was like, hell yeah, you got it. Not only that, he insisted on pulling out all the tricks. Infusing his own simple syrup with mint and having us over TWICE to taste the recipe and make sure it was perfect. He loves his job and it shows. He took full ownership of the bar and making sure we didn't even have to think about it. THANK YOU HUNTER!!!  In summary,14TENN was an absolute dream come true  and we cannot recommend them enough.

"Ok, I am now truly convinced of two things: 1-In america, most barbers suck. 2-Yelp is totally unreliable and hides negative reviews (not recommended thing, as will happen to this one) if the businesses pay for it. I called and made an appointment. They asked if it matters who does the haircut, I said no. Well, I think they gave me to the most inexperienced barber in town or something, because she totally sucked. 1-Did not pay attention to what I described.  2-Just took a tiny little bit from sides and said done.  3-I told her I need to really shorten my hair (for a second time now), she then took a little bit more and left it like that. End result: Messy hair looking as bad and as long as before.

Charles greeted us and checked on us throughout the meal.  Service was great.  Their vegetarian won ton soup really hit the spot on a cold day.  Won ton soup is one of those things you can't find in a vegetarian version unless you're in Chinatown.  Us suburbanites don't get to enjoy it that often.

"Disappointing first experience. We made our reservation on Open Table, which we always do without problem, but they didn't have it at the restaurant when we arrived. The hostess was able to squeeze us into a table right between two others with much wait though. The atmosphere and decor are great! The menu had many vegetarian and vegan options which I was thrilled about. We ordered cocktails that looked wonderful, the Recycled Paper Plane was, but the Aunt Ginger's was muted and flavorless. As we were seated, the folks right next to us were just ordering drinks, and the table on our other side was seated about 5 minutes later. Both of these table received their drinks, dinners and desserts before we got any of our food! Our server breezily mentioned that our food would be out soon as she took our second drink order. No apology, no explanation, no can I get you a drink in the house, just our food should be coming. The table to our left actually spit out her brownie dessert on first bite as she found it so inedible. A wonderful experience for me as our elbows were practically touching! The server then asked her is she wanted to take it to go! People watching was good, as a stream of people continuously walk through the restaurant to get to the downstairs bar or back by on their way out. We sipped our second drinks, the Gandy, which was good but came without the hibiscus ice which was a bummer. Our food finally arrived and the black eyed pea cakes were delicious- although they were served on a bed of ice cold couscous which was jarring with the very hot cakes. The Goan patty was a flaky, sweet pastry stuffed with a nicely spicy potato and pea filling. We declined dessert after our neighbor's experience and our long wait for dinner, and headed downstairs to the self-described speakeasy. We found a basement bar, with a very loud band doing a Dobie Gray cover, and the same cocktail menu. All in all, not the experience I was hoping for.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Dude, no. What the heck happened to this brand, man. I'd say our pizza was on par with dominos, pizza hut, or Little Cesar's even. Really disappointed.  First off, we had our pizza and our cinnamon bite things delivered, And they didn't knock on the door or ring the bell. We had no idea it had already been delivered, and was sitting outside at night for a half an hour before we checked the order summary, wondering why it hadn't been delivered yet.   The cinnamon bite things were fine. Sugar and cinnamon are kinda hard to mess up, even though it was straight cold.    The pizza? Well first, it was cold, you know, from sitting outside on the ground for a half an hour.   Second, the quality of the ingredients. My wife literally said ""this sausage tastes like dog food."" All of it tasted awful, as if they shopped the dollar store freezer isle. Not great.   The crust? Paper thin, and all the toppings slid off of it when we picked it up, as it hung limp, like an old dead fish.   It was supposed to be stuffed crust, as well. The edge crust part was HUGE, with a thin slice of cold cheese in it. Now I see where the rest of the crust went. Seems like it was all rolled out to the edge, with the actual body of the pizza thin as paper.

"I was so sad, when my favorite coffee shop, Roast Inc., was closing it's coffee shop portion, focusing only on roasting and cold brews.  I figured it was for the best for them, and I was glad to hear that they started to feature beans at good coffee shops like Edgehill Cafe, but I felt that something deep inside me was lost without getting to visit Brad and Lesa way down on Trousdale Pike.  How excited I was to read that they were opening their brand new place on 8th Ave. S., much closer to downtown.  I found the location, and watched it as they prepped the spot for weeks.  And when the Scene announced, out of nowhere that they were having an unofficial tasting, I could not wait to stop by.  And, not surprisingly, it's amazing, when you walk in, you're immediately greeted by these two very large tables, bearing small cards saying the wood for these tables were reclaimed twice, once from China, and then again from a Bowling Alley from somewhere in South Nashville.  They look just like bowling lanes.  Their counters are very open and inviting, and even their newest employees ""get it.""  They may not totally understand the roasting and flavor experience, but they are working hard, and I like that.  Brad and Lesa, as always, are pure sunshine, and they by themselves make 8th and Roast a worthy experience.  Their little gimmick (and don't take that the wrong way, I LOVE gimmicks!), is an open pour-bar where you can the hot water over the single origin beans yourself if you care to.  They clearly want to make you part of the coffee experience, and no one else does that, in Nashville at least.  This isn't a place where they get bags and bags of beans from some central roaster hundreds of miles aways: they roast their coffee themselves, and they work hard at it. It shows in every cup.  They don't cut corners and they don't settle for anything less than some of the best beans in the world.  I've raved and raved and raved over Roast Inc, and I can only imagine that this will bring a much wider audience to their wonderful products.  Nashville has gotten such a great selection of coffee places, but if I were to choose only one, 8th & Roast would be it without any hesitation.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"After reading many positive reviews and reading about how Peter Gilmore was a former chef at Le Bec Fin, we were very anxious to have dinner at his restaurant.  Sorry to say, but we were greatly disappointed.  It wasn't that anything was particularly bad, it just wasn't anything special.  The atmosphere was very nice and charming inside.  The service had some great point and then some lows.  For example, after the first and second courses, we were asked how everything was - -but not during the main course.  So when we told the waiter that the hanger steak was kind of tough, he said ""well that's why we come by and ask when it is served"" - - but they did not.  Also, when coffee was served, I had to ask for sugar.  They put a sugar bowl on the table with a variety of artificial sweetners neatly fanned out on a plate - but a bunch of the packets were already used and empty.  Yuck.  Again during dessert - -my sister asked for the sauce to be on the side.  When it came all over the dish, she said that she asked for it on the side, the server said ""that is not what I was told"".  Huh?  As for the food, it was just ok.  The hanger steak was tough, and I'm just not sure that is a cut of beef I would put on a high end menu, more like pub food for me.  The duck was okay, a little tough and they provide a butter knife with hardly any ridges so it was work to cut it.  The seared ahi tuna appetizer was one of the least interesting ahi dishes I have ever had.  Just bland.  The only real upside to the entire meal was the dessert course.  The butterscotch bread pudding was sinful.  One of the most amazing desserts that we have ever seen was the chocolate mousse in a candy-apple shell.  But it wasn't like a red candy apple from the county fair - -it was like finely painted china, paper thin, perfect shape and even had the leaf.  I have no idea how they do that, but it was beautiful.  Anyhow, we were looking for a 5 star gourmet meal, like at one of Peter Kelly's restaurants in the NY area.  But this was a very average meal.  Peter Gilmore came out and shook everyones hand, but never even asked us how our meal was.  Huh?  Needless to say, we won't be returning.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Bushman 'shrooms were overcooked with no flavor, crab-topped medium rare sirloin was almost inedible, steak knife wouldn't cut the gristle throughout, and the crab, possibly canned, had no moisture or sauce. The salad and vegetable medley side were the only things with flavor. Service was not much better.

"We stopped here for Saturday brunch for two reasons.  One, we were hungry. Two, the place next door could not seat us.  This place was pretty busy too, but we found a couple of seats at the patio bar.    One of the bartenders quickly greeted us and handed over a couple of menus.  They had a build-your-own Bloody Mary bar that was stocked with an impressive selection of garnishes.  I ordered one, of course!  For food I went with a not-so-brunchy option: The Row Cobb; a salad topped with smoked turkey, tomato, eggs, avocado, bacon, and cheddar cheese, served with a bleu cheese vinaigrett dressing.  I was expecting slices of processed turkey on the salad, but it was bbq smoked, and pulled meat!  Somehow I missed that when ordering and it was a pleasant surprise.  I loved it!  My friend ordered the Midtown Bennie... He inhaled it, so it must have been good!  At some point between ordering our food and being served, I noticed a Yelp check-in offer for free fried pickles.  I checked in, showed the offer to the bartender, and a few minutes later we had our free pickles!  The pickles were cut in strips rather than the rounds that I'm accustom to seeing.  Interesting... They tasted pretty darn good!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

This is the worst bar I have ever been in Philly. Bartender Lessie refused to serve me a drink after I had only one before. Forget that I was waiting 30 min to get her attention and to hear that I can't have another one. Couple next to me said same thing. They stopped serving them as well. Gentelman who sat on the other side said same thing that they refuse making drinks all the time here. After reading some of the reviews I see that it happens there all the time. Cocktails are expensive if you want to go out and have few drinks make sure you have 100$ to spend. If Lessie or kevin or other bartender will even feel like to make you another drink. Stuff was very rude and unprofessional. For a bar on Rittenhouse square I would expect to be classy. But not that bar. There were only 10 people on Saturday night around the bar. I guess there is a clear reason right here why this bar is not crowded. I will never go there ever again or recommend this place to anyone.

"This is a review for brunch only -- I've never eaten at P&K for dinner.  I would highly recommend it as a brunch spot, both for ambience and food.  Unlike nearby Honeys, it's unlikely that there will be a wait -- pub and kitchen as a brunch spot feels like a well-kept secret.   The brunch drinks are great; I went on a snowy day and had a spiked cider, and their bloodies are good as well.  In addition, my servers have always been awesome. I want to be their friends.   The best part of brunch is that the p&k burger is on the menu; it's one of the best in the city. The French fries are really nice and crispy.   I also got a special trout Benedict one day, which was unusual, but a bit too rich for me. If I have one complaint about brunch here, it's that it tends to be a meal on the heavier side. Nevertheless, it's a great spot, and the sunlight streaming into the back room is extremely pleasant.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Always looking for a dinner place to share with our college son when we visit and ""put  him into a food coma"" (Parent's of college kids, the look of stupor and then falling asleep in car as you drive them back to their dorm ie happy student) :-)  Attire? I wore a business casual suit. My hubby had jeans. It all works. The next table was more dressy but we all felt comfortable.  First, this is located INSIDE the Upham B&B, so you might miss it driving by.  Think Victorian looking house and charming little place with cozy bar on one side and cooks brick oven on other. Makes for a homey atmosphere.  We went early ie 5:30, and yet still surprised at how empty it was...not that it was a bad thing. Trey the co-owner came by, explained the menu and took our orders. He was friendly and funny and put us at ease.   Bread was warm and fresh and yummy. The wine I ordered was a local Santa Barbara varietal and I remember saying ""nice"" The crab dumplings were delicious, and light if that makes sense. Not an overpowering sauce, but simple and tasty.  My son and I ordered the scottish salmon. My hubby did something of the red meat variety (forgive me, I don't recall what, I just remember forking his hands when he tried to steal my salmon). All of us enjoyed our dinners.    I took coffee rather than dessert, because just down the street was McConnell's Ice Cream (corner of De La Vina and Mission, here is the yelp: http://www.yelp.com/biz/mcconnells-ice-cream-santa-barbara) so I had ice cream on the brain)  A few weeks ago, my husband asked me about Louie's.

Also, if going with a larger party, order a large pizza pie, well done (trust me you will love it).   I have never been to Picas with a party smaller than six and every time we all leave, we leave happy. The service and food is great and it is what will keep my family driving from various parts of Pennsylvania to have our family functions.

"Nancy hemmed and ironed a bridesmaid dress for me. She did a beautiful job - the dress looks perfect. Her pricing is incredibly reasonable (I initially went to my dry cleaners to have it hemmed and they wanted to charge me over $100). Nancy's quote was half that. Her shop is so cute. It's located at 2900 Mill Street - park on the side of the building furthest away from Mill, and she's upstairs.   Nancy also makes custom clothing, including dresses, shirts, costumes, etc. Her clothing is well made, and she can make just about anything you can think of. She's got many different kinds of fabrics. She also has a shop on Etsy - it's called Purple Monkey Creations.   Nancy was able to get my bridesmaid's dress back to me within 2 days - and that was a huge relief since the wedding is coming up.   I highly recommend Nancy for any sewing/alteration/design needs.

The music was in fact amazing, and so was the ambiance but the service was awful (they must have been shorthanded by 4 servers) and the food was only mediocre.

On my second visit to Ybor as a college freshman at USF, we decided to go to Prana because we heard it was the place to be on college night. It certainly was. What I love most about Prana is it has something for everyone. The first two floors are the main room. The second floor is a balcony that looks below, and they have a bar up there. It's a good place to grab a drink when the place gets packed. When I was going there, the next floor was always VIP, and the above that was another room that had another bar and DJ that usually had something a little bit different playing. They had a lot of reggae and spanish music on that level. When we needed some air or were in the mood for something more laid back, we headed to the roof. There was usually live music up there, and it was nice to catch a breeze before heading back downstairs to dance.   The music was always good, the people were cool, the guys were less creepy, and it was well worth the cover charge.

The waitress was curt and abrupt at best.  She does not have the finesse to be a good waitress.  When you see a glass almost empty, you should get the person a refill.  I had to wave down a supervisor who immediately brought me a new glass, he left the empty glass.  The waitress came by and saw the empty and was going to get me a refill when she noticed that I already had one.  The comment was: ""Oh, you already got a refill"".  I had a coupon which she took at the beginning of the meal, commented when we were ready for the bill that she will see that the coupon is applied.  Except, she brought the bill without the credit.  I showed it to her and her comment was, ""he was supposed to take the amount off"".  Brought the corrected bill with no comment: no sorry, no thank you, nothing.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 2.0
"Mojos tacos vibe is a big step up from the sleepy atmosphere Sapphire brought to the factory. Tacos are amazing and affordable. Don't listen to the people on here complaining about service, Mojos is coming from a food truck to a restaurant and there will be a learning curve. The owner is already working on getting the speed of the line picked up. The food is so good that it brought the huge line so if you don't want good food there are plenty of other places to go and it will help shorten the line.   To the people complaining and giving horrible reviews, this is why we don't have fun, entertaining, locally owned restaurants in Franklin.

"When I saw that a new sushi restaurant was going in where the really quite despicable Tucks used to be, I was extremely excited. I go to school at Tulane and bike down Freret several times a week, so sime close, simple sushi sounded great! With that in mind, mah lady and I stopped in on a Tuesday night for dinner.  First, the positive. The decor in the place is really great. The atmosphere, though it could use a bit of dimming (not a whole lot, just a tad to make it more intimate), is wonderful. I could barely believe that Origami is what used to be Tucks. The art on the walls was great, the sushi bar looked awesome, and everything seemed well put together.  Unfortunately, the decor was the best thing about our experience. The waiters (there were two working the night I was there) did not seem to have assigned tables, and there wasn't anybody to seat us. Once the guy working the sushi bar directed us to a table, we had to ask one of the waiters for a menu. Service for the rest of the meal was similarly confused; both waiters tried to take our order, but no one asked how our food tasted. When our sushi did come, it came in three different increments, which doesn't make much sense to me, since I like to try and sample all of the food at once. The service was simply poor--not the worst that I've experienced, but poor indeed.  I was hoping that bad service might indicate great food, but here I was also incorrect. We had four rolls, two basics and two specials. While our two basics were good (it's hard to mess up a crunchy and a philadelphia roll), our special rolls were not only expensive, they just weren't impressive. Both of the special rolls seemed to be lacking something, and one of them had been toasted with a butane torch (I presume this, because it tasted a little like gas). While the rolls looked good on paper, they simply didn't fit the bill.  All told, if you want great sushi uptown, there are several other places you could go: Hana, Kyoto, etc. I intend to give Origami another chance after they've settled in, but for now, ""Meh. I've experienced better"" pretty accurately described my experience.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Ok, so years back, they actually served spicy food here. One of the best dishes I've had at Han Dynasty was something another person in my party ordered and then couldn't actually eat due to the spice. It was, indeed, very very spicy and also very, very delicious.  More recently though, the spice levels went down... by a lot. Last time I visited, I ordered a Dry Pepper Style entr√©e that's listed as an 8/10 on the spice scale, and found that it was barely spicy. Tonight, I ordered a Dry Pot Style entr√©e--supposedly a 10--and it was, to me, at most *mildly* hot.  My friends disagreed with my assessment that the food was not spicy, but they didn't think it was searingly hot either. And everything we ordered was 7-10 so it really should have been. And look, ok, I suppose I do have a pretty high spice tolerance but I've had food here that I'd consider hot--just years and years ago. Based on my more recent experiences I can't imagine anyone other than my very Eastern European grandmother being unable to eat the level 10 dishes.  If we could award half-stars I'd give the place 3.5, because heat level aside, it was an enjoyable meal. The service was just ok--not very attentive considering it was a quiet night. But the food was tasty and the sauces were very nice. Still, if I wanted a mild, enjoyable meal, I could get that almost anywhere.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

A few weeks ago I went to Nashville for a soccer game. The day of the game we went to the game and ate lunch there.  After both games we walked to the friends house where we were staying with some friends. After a quick shower we decided to go hit some bars. At the first bar we went to they had just closed the kitchen at like 10. What kinda bar does that? Anyway we went to dukes after the bad bar. It's definitely a hipster bar of a type. Nothing wrong with that. It was super crowded but still didn't take us long to order our food. I got a sandwich that was heated and had tons of awesome cheese on it. Holy crap was it good. After we ordered though we saw other options for different sandwiches that were not on the menu and I might have gotten one of those since there was one that sounded amazing (don't remember what one now). It did take a bit to get our drink orders in but that's more the fact of the crowd than the bars.,Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 5.0

"I chose this hotel (even after reading the bad reviews) because I was in Philly for 1 night with 2 girlfriends for a concert at the Wells Fargo Center & just wanted a room that was cheap (since I was already planning on spending a ton of money on my trip), close to the venue, and didnt have bugs. I did not tell my friends about the reviews for the hotel until we were standing in line at check in. I pulled them up on my phone, we all were laughing hysterically & my friends were saying 'We're gonna kill you! What were you thinking!'. We laughed all the way up the elevator to room 1104 where we stayed & anticipated seeing the room which we thought would be Bates Motel based on other reviews. Things the other reviews got right: the carpet was dirty & did not appear vacuumed (whatever we kept our shoes on). The room did smell old & musty (this was taken care of with a few squirts of body spray.) Things that differed from the other reviews: The bathroom was clean & worked well, there were 2 waste baskets, there was a large coat rack, the bedding was very clean, comfortable & smelled fresh. The walls & curtains were very clean-looking. The air conditioner worked like a dream. The decor was modern (flat screen TV, black, white & silver lamp/headboard/mirrors (no flowers)) I would stay there again.

I would never take any of my non-Korean friends to this restaurant...I'd be too embarrassed to call it Korean food.

"I love this hotel.  Love it.  It's so charming, an old renovated bakery in fact, but it's all modernized and comfortable.  We got a room in the back, with no windows.  I know, that sounds crazy.  But we loved it.  We could sleep in as late as we wanted.  There was no noise, it was like we were on the floor by ourselves expect when housekeeping came through.  The room was huge, the bathroom was recently remodeled and the exposed beams and exposed brick walls were so cool to see.  Our room was 434 and it was exactly like the pictures people have posted.  Except maybe a little larger.  We had an elevator to get up there too.    I'm writing this from the courtyard in the center of the hotel, by the little saltwater pool.  It's beautiful. There is wrought iron tables and chairs, fountains, and lush greenery.  It's everything you want a New Orleans hotel to be.  The staff is also super friendly.  They were so kind and helpful.  And the location is pretty great.  At first I was put off because it's located on A very busy touristy Street- right down from the French Market, and across from the dock.  There's a lot of retail right on the street, and bars.  The first night we were here there was a Halloween parade outside in the street (funny story, we didn't know the parade was happening til we got to the lobby- our room was so quiet and even the courtyard was so quiet, we had no idea)...  but it was kind of fun to be in such a busy area and it was super convenient to Royal St (shopping), Boubon St (eating and drinking), some great historic sites (The Basilica, Jackson Square, etc) and even the casino was just a short walk away.  So while I may have been initially turned off, I've come to love it.  And I feel like I saved a lot of money by not having to take an uber or can anywhere.  We are across from a streetcar stop, and it's $3 for an all day pass!!!  I will definitely stay here next time I'm in town.

It was after 8pm on a Weds, and not that busy, so this should've been an easy meal to prep and send out-- but the kitchen was not paying attention to what it was serving, and service was slow once I requested the dressing.  Take note, Iron Hill- When you slice thru an overripe avocado with black, decomposing sections in it  normally you cut those sections out or compost the entire thing -- NOT plate it to the customer.  This place is always busy, but its food quality was poor on my last visit, and it will be awhile before I go back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Lemme sum up:  Very good food, good liquor selection, friendly staff  Been here a couple of times and am making this a regular stop.  It's a convenient location with plenty of parking.  The interior is a little dark but roomy.  You don't feel like you HAVE to talk to the guy next to you at the bar, or the table beside you because there's enough space to sip your Scotch and watch the game.  The food and drink are decent.  How can you beat a 50% drinks and pizza during happy hour?  And they offer artichoke and goat cheese for toppings.  Good stuff!  They advertise a thin crust, but anyone from New York would take one look and say 'You're kiddin' me, right?'  It's actually a flatbread pizza, but still very good.  Truth be told, what won me over was that they had Oban but they certainly charge you for it.  When you charge ""expensive"" and take 50% off, it's back to a normal price.  Guess I'll stick to the beer.  Screens are a little small for a sports bar.  There are plenty of screens running around the bar so chances are you can find whatever game you want to, but you have to sit at the bar to get a good view.  Get a few very large screens and we'll be talking a fourth star.  The concept of cash flow is amusing.  There is an ATM on the premises and video poker at the bar.  I think they're running some kind of gambling promotion, too.  Easy come, easy go, as they say.  Need a place for pub grub and want to keep your eye on more than one game?

We were greeted by the kindest woman, and she made comfortable and genuine conversation as she walked us to our table. The atmosphere was very homey and not the ""boojiest"" place around, but those kind of restaurants are my favorite. Now, for the food! They gave us complimentary saut√©ed carrots and bread. The carrots weren't out of this world, but they were nice to pick at before our entrees came out. We did wish the bread came out warm (it would have made it much better) but either way free bread will make us happy regardless. Of course, we couldn't go without ordering the fried calamari (one of my guilty pleasures). However, I'd rate them maybe a 6.5/10. They had a good flavor, but still very mild with usual seasonings I'm used to on calamari,  and each piece was very thin. But, they did have a good marinara sauce to pair with it. For our entrees, my boyfriend got a veal parmesan and I got the black ink pasta. They gave great portion sizes, and both meals were quite delicious. The black ink pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce was very flavorful. Also, nothing beats the fact that the place is BYOB AND we could still order drinks from the menu.

"Hyde Park is always a great stop and the holidays bring out the lights and feeling of community.  I decided to try a new place, I have my go to down here.  We were seated right away near the window and the place is charming albeit a little loud.  I started with one of their specialty drinks, watermelon based and very light.   We decided to share the Athenian pizza and a Cobb salad. The pizza was flavorful, not greasy, the crust needed to be a little more crisp. The salad was great with the addition of avocado, I'm not much for Bleu cheese anything  outside of a specialty dish, so I swapped it for Ranch.  All in all a very nice meal.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Pane Rustica's Chocolate Espresso Cookies are a chocoholic's nirvana. Call first because they often sell out even though they bake them several times a day. They have crunchy, caky and gooey textures all in the same cookie. Rich doesn't describe the experience. The only strange thing is they dust them with powdered sugar -- the proverbial lily gilded. Tough to keep the white stuff off your black clothes if you're like me and eat them (shameless I have occasionally eaten more than one at a time) in the car as you drive away -- unable to delay gratification. Hey, this is my one and only addiction. I'm pretty well controlled on everything else!

"Rating 2 since a 1 should really have involved a conversation with the manager.  My mistake.  Anyway, we had a table of 4 and a takeout order so we got a real taste of this place.  Not good   Calamari was frozen rings thrown in a fryer  and meatballs were like meatloaf?  Bread was great so we were interested in seeing how dinner went.  The Gorgonzola sauce pasta was sweet and strange.  The linguini that came with the chicken parm and chicken piccata was all pressed together like a piece of pasta cake.  Hard to believe this wasn't obvious when playing the food.  The penne vodka tasted like red pizza sauce and was missing key ingredients like cream and vodka.

"Mixed review.  Arrived at 5 pm Saturday to find that there were no rooms available for check in. Not exactly what you want to hear after driving for 8 hours. There were 15 rooms ahead of ours that needed cleaning and many tired, frustrated customers waiting in the lobby. I was offered ""a drink"" to make it better. No thanks. My room was ready 2-1/2 hours later. Fortunately, there are many things to do nearby.   The hotel is older, but clean and relatively updated in areas. They are sorely understaffed causing long slow lines at the front desk. The staff is polite. Parking is free, but The back lot is dark and unsecured. A bit creepy at night. Good location near Westshore Mall, the airport and the bridges to St. Pete and Clearwater. 10-15 minutes from Downtown Tampa or Hyde Park area.   Rooms updated and clean. Hallways need work - dark and creepy. The shades are inadequate in the rooms. Our south facing room was extremely bright at 6:30 am. Forget about sleeping late. Keurig and fridge in the room was nice touch. If you want Starbucks get to lobby early. They have limited hours and menu.

"Iavarone's is a wonderful ""date night"" restaurant located in Northwest Hillsborough County at the corner of Himes Avenue and Humphrey Street -- not far from N. Dale Mabry and Waters Avenue.  This is an old-school family owned and operated Italian Steakhouse & Grill. The Iavarone family opened such well-known restaurants as Carmine's on 7th Avenue in Ybor, Malio's on S. Dale Mabry, and Iavarone's in NW Hillsborough. The restaurant had it's Cigar City Mafia connections back in the day, and there is a lot of history associated with this place.  Fast forward to today, and Iavarone's is a very elegant steakhouse where you'll be warmly greeted by the Maitre d' and then wait in the bar area for your table. The whole restaurant is richly-paneled in dark wood and their immense wine collection sits on display between glass windows. You can have a beer or glass of wine in the bar area, or sip on one of their carefully-crafted cocktails.  The Maitre d' will come and get you when your table is ready, and then weave you through the dining room to your spot. A basket of hot bread is not far behind. The service is top-notch at Iavarone's, they are quick to refill your beverages but stay discretely out of the way so that you can have a private discussion.  You'll find the menu has a high-end selection of appetizers (I highly recommend the Bada Bing Shrimp), soups, and salads. From there you launch right in to the steaks, chops, prime ribs, chicken, veal, seafood, and excellent pasta dishes. Everything is delicious, and the portions are very generous. For dessert you'll find the classic Italian standards of tiramisu, cr√®me brulee, cannoli, and NY style cheesecake.  I highly recommend a bottle of their excellent Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon with your meal. Dinner will not be cheap, but the meal and the dining experience will be a very pleasant memory.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"This is an alright venue! I've gotta say, i was way more impressed with it when i first walked in than i was after being here for an hour... It looks pretty damn cool and the bar is beautiful, but i prior to arriving i had a busy day on my feet and was hoping to take a load off before the headliner... but there were no tables or chairs anywhere! I kinda expect there to be at least a few seats at any given venue! I still had fun, but i probably would have raged a lot harder if i didn't feel like such an old lady with mega sore feet!!  Still though, the acoustics were awesome! Definitely a place where if you're stoked on seeing a band, you've gotta show up early! I'm a shortie, but i'd already seen the band play before so i wasn't too bummed about not being able to see much, but if i go back to see a band i'm super excited for i'm definitely wearing some platforms!  Drink prices were so-so. If you're drinking beers it's alright, but my bf and i chose to save some money and save the more serious drinking for after the show at a few cheaper places nearby.

"We had dinner tonight at this restaurant with a group of 20. The service was great, very helpful and polite amidst a large and (I'll say it) demanding group. The food was delicious. This is a family restaurant run by a wonderful family. We have been patrons of this restaurant for years and for all the Japanese restaurant options in the area this is where we continue to return for two simple reasons: 1. The family that owns this restaurant cares about their customers and 2. the food has never failed to meet our expectations. The food is fresh and delivered in a timely manner. The ginger dressing on the house salad is a can't-miss (you can purchase by the pint)! Sushi is fresh and made to order.  If you're with a large group make reservations in advance to be sure you are seated together. Otherwise, there is nothing about this place that we've ever been disappointed with, and it's family oriented so bring your kids! The atmosphere is comfortable and casual, so if you're looking for something a bit more urban-chic maybe not the place for you. But an all-around fulfilling experience if you like good food and great service. We'll definitely come back!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"UPDATE: They changed locations. The brunch menu is weak. There are no other options, they do not and would not cook the steak frites I love because its on the dinner menu. Still love these guys but its been scaled for profit and is wack. A taco shop took the old spot over, same owners. Cant mix and match taco plates. The tacos are OK, but no homemade hot sauce (wack). Super inconvenient day out in Reno at my favorite place.  I've had two of their burgers  (Bbq bison & a grassfed beef more traditional burger) Both were great.  But what I really want to talk about is their Steak Frites.  A huge steak!  Perfect frites small and crunchy.  AND THE SAUCE!!...yup its bomb kind of creamy and rich,  right on the edge of gravy.  It soaks in with the frites and if you are intelligent enough to get it all on the same fork.  Your mind will be blown. Oh, and a super hip bar selection!!!... I highly recommend this joint.

"Narrow, deep and dark, on a block full of restaurants that are narrow, deep and dark...  The only reason we ate at this joint is because my sweetheart had gotten us a Groupon for it while still in Carolina... and by the time I spotted the hustler at the door (the guy trying to snag business off the street), it was too late to turn back.  Granted, on lower Decatur there are lots of places hustling diners...  Once inside, I felt... hustled.  Used.  Cheap.  Tawdry.  Okay, let me stop right there - because that's when our waiter came by.  I'm loath to mention his name, because I don't want to get him into any trouble.  Yeah, he pushed the specials and the overpriced wine like he was supposed to.  He met less resistance than he would have had we not come armed with our 1/2 price Groupon, so he became very helpful.  He even told my sweetie that the only difference between the pan-seared ahi tuna and the appetizer by the same name was that the former came with sides, and the latter was sliced.  It was otherwise identical.  The same weight.  With a $13 difference.  As it was, her tuna was alright.  Not bad, mind you, but not the kind of meal that would have me beating a path to their door, either.  Just alright.  The same goes for my stuffed fillet.  I guess I'm spoiled; the Shula's 347 in Chapel Hill has got THE filet to beat, and this one didn't come close.  It was good, mind you, but not what you expect from a filet... especially for that price.  Even the dessert was... alright.  We'd finished it and paid the bill before our coffee came.

I like the place, I understand why on a Thursday night at 8:00 there was a 35 minute wait and we had to sit at a bartop. This place is a breath of fresh air.  The waitress was both attentive but relaxed.  She knew her job.   The Lobster Enchiladas were really solid. Unexpected, and great. The Cheese Enchiladas were good, but not great. Rice & Beans were very good. The smooth texture of the beans is the way Grand Mama make them.   The Guacamole is smooth, like one would get in family own Mexican Restaurants out of the Seventies. Smooth with a cheese garnish. A food archeological find. I miss this style of Guacamole. I like the chunkier Guacamole but well done smooth Guacamole is great. It reminds me of my misspent youth.  The House Margarita, was the way they should be done. Not like a slushy but on the rocks with fresh tasting ingredients. No need for a Cadillac, just simple and honest.  The made at the table salsa is great, but no explanation, just a question on how hot, throwing the ingredients together and move on.  The taste was great, but done by routine. But I do understand that it was late.  But the reason why I they lost a star.  COLD tortilla chips. The other reviews said the chips were warm. They were fresh, from the night before.

Coffee on the spacious balcony watching the sunrise over the ocean (yes, sunrise) was beautiful. We will definitely return.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 5.0

"While visiting in-laws in Nashville, they wanted to treat us to takeout from this place since they've enjoyed it several times in the past. Even though it wasn't the closest place to where they live, they thought it was worthwhile to order takeout from there. Pickup seemed kind of odd since it's located in what looks like an office building and you actually drive around the building. We enjoyed several types of crab claws as apps (so tasty) and I enjoyed my crab cakes, which my mother-in-law also got. I can't speak to the pricing since they paid, but I can definitely say the quality of the food was very good and oh those crab claws!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"One drink and gone. Once again, someone puts a lot of money into a new restaurant without doing the most important thing. Training the staff. Walked in and couldn't find a hostess or front manager so we took seats at a 2 top by the bar. After sitting there for a few minutes I said, not too quietly, that we may as well go the bar since we can't get service here. Just as I was finishing that sentence a waitress walked up to the table and said. WHERE""S THE RECEIPT? She went on that there was another couple here and where was the restaurant's copy of the receipt? No, hello, good evening, may I help you, nope, just ""where's the receipt""? Looked around for her, but by that time she was looking around on the floor, she couldn't find the receipt and left. It was her station and she never asked to take our order. Strike 1. Sat at the bar and asked for an Oban scotch. The lady bartender, who was pleasant, said let me check. After a brief conference she came back and said they didn't have Oban. Ok, I ordered another scotch which she also found out they also didn't carry. After the 3rd attempt, one of the male bartenders came over put a booklet in front of me and said....That's all we have.... Ok, didn't want what was on the list of 10 or 11 scotch's so I had a glass of wine. Staff doesn't know what they carry and the list is not that large. Strike 2. By the way, the wines by the glass are so-so, but moderatley priced. Liquor list is not large and when you sit at the bar you see more open space than liquor bottles. Not a good sign for a place that lists itself as a bistro, restaurant and bar. I missed the bar part. I asked for a menu and was told by the same male bartender that I was sitting in the bistro, and in the bistro they have a bistro menu, but if you sit in the restaurant you can see a restaurant menu. After a couple more ""see spot run "" type exchanges I finally was told that it might be possible to order from either menu, even though we were actually sitting in the bistro part. Strike 3. While looking at the menu 2 guys to my left kept asking to have  the World Series turned on. Why? I have no idea beacuse they barely spoke English and they spent 90% of the time swiveling around in their chairs staring at people. It got so annoying I finally stared back and at least the one guy stopped ogling. Now, to my right was the floor show of the evening. A couple who had at least 1 too many attempting soft porn at the bar. I have nothing against love making, I set my thermostat at 69,  but if you don't have a room in the hotel, go out to the car, knock one off and come back. No one likes sex more than me, but a brightly lit bar at 9 o'clock isn't the place.  Dear god, these two would take a sip of wine and then try to find the others tonsils for 30 seconds. I felt sorry for the girl because she was really turned on and wanted to run her fingers thru his hair, but since he had on a Howard Eskine used toupee I guess she thought better of doing so. They had ordered frites and flatbread and when the food arrived so did some guy who seemed to know these 2. He had on the new uniform. Last couple years the uniform was jeans, striped shirt out of the pants and pointy shoes. It seems that has given way to trail boots by North Face, ugly jeans that don't fit, and a black quarter zip pullover. I guess this is the Paul Bunyan look, and this guy was close to the size of the great woodsman himself. Actually his attire came in handy because he kept putting his hand in the basket of fries and stuffing them in his mouth. The best part is he would wipe the grease on his shirt or jeans. Classy guy. I don't know about you, but nothing whets my appetite like someone stuffing food in their mouth and then wiping the grease on their clothes. At that point I asked for the check. The male bartender looked crestfallen and said....""so, you aren't going to eat""?  I paid the bill and left. As we were walking down the ramp another couple was in front of us and up came 2 middle-aged, balding, paunchy yahoos who asked the couple if the bar was a HOT SPOT for 2 guys like them. Yes, thats really what they said folks I have no idea what the food is like and never will. Why open a restaurant, which is well done inside, and then have a staff like that? Waitress was upset about the missing receipt, but she could of at least said hello. Bartenders don't know the stock, and it isn't a huge selection like Capital Grill or Flemings. We heard the one bartender say he was sorry 2 or 3 times because he was getting drinks wrong. No hostess or manager upon entering. Just not a good way to start a new venture. Was looking forward to another place close to home, but this isn't it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
Picked up a chicken with garlic sauce to go ($9) for lunch today and was very disappointed. The taste was not terrible but the dish was 95% vegetables and about 3 pcs of chicken. The vegetables were very large and not cut well. I asked for white rice and they gave me brown rice. I think they skimped on the chicken and threw in the cheap ingredients.  I think this was about the quality of a chinese take-out place. I even threw out the egg roll after a bite because it was all filler.   Next time I will stick to the chinese restaurants I know and trust.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Antojitos was rather disappointing. We tried to order delivery via Yelp/Grubhub, but after placing the order, it looked like it was for pickup only.  It would have been nice if this were made clear at the time of ordering, but it wasn't a huge problem because we live nearby.   When we went to pick up our order, the restaurant was packed at lunchtime, with what appeared to be no social distancing. I really didn't feel safe walking in, and it would have been more convenient to have a delivery or curbside pickup option.  We'd ordered a variety of dishes, including tacos, enchiladas, a quesadilla, burrito, and a few other things.  As others have mentioned, their tortilla chips are absolutely shameful and seem to come from a bag.  The food was pretty forgettable, and they left out two of our entrees, while charging us for them.  I had to spend 15 minutes or so on the phone with Grubhub to get a refund on the items we didn't receive, which was extremely annoying.  I won't be back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Good to have, because I have dietary restrictions. -Have a full pool size hot tub, in case you get cold or something in the middle of summer.  Cons: -Housekeeping can either be amazing or terrible, depends on the day. (One day they took the ""extra"" pillow we had on our bed.) -Front Desk was not very friendly. -The room we stayed in smelled strongly of cigarettes. Nowhere else in the hotel smelled that way.

"Great place for a quick bite or a full meal.   I came here with friends to start off my vacation and Bourbon Street shenanigans, so decided on small bites before making our way into the party madness. We waited in line for a good ten minutes before we were seated in the restaurant. We had fried alligator with a sauce that complemented the appetizer and we ended our meal with 12 char-grilled oysters.   For the two times I've visited NOLA, char-grilled oysters are a must and Felix's feeds my seafood desires. Bathed in buttery goodness who would deny a plate of oysters.

"We wanted to grab a bite at a pub type atmosphere.  Heard Six Paupers was worth a try so we headed over for a Friday night dinner.   COVID restrictions exist so tables were spaced more than normal but everything else was in full swing.  Met immediately at the door and seated.  Accommodated our seating request so we could sit near the bar easily.      Ordered French Dip and the Filet Mignon.   French dip was fantastic but they are hard to mess up.  The Fillet was top notch.   My wife is crazy and likes well done beef,  somehow they nailed it perfectly with a slight char outside, perfectly well done yet still juicy inside.  Made me regret my French dip.  This meal was easily better than the ""best steak joint in town"" we visited previously and under half the cost.  The sides were even great.   perfectly done zucchini and tasty  mashed potatoes.  We let the server know how much we liked our meal and she indicated they recently changed chef's and she also really liked the food.      Service was good and perfectly timed.

Out of all the places in sb I decided to stop by here while we were passing by.   I really had great expectation to this place. The reviews and the pictures made this place a wonderful place to try.   There was a great parking lot near the restaurant that gave us free 75 minute parking which I thought wow great. It was also located in downtown sb which I love cause it was a great way to explore the place after our meal.   Finally arriving to the restaurant... very cute place btw.   We end up ordering the crab cake potato hash with poached eggs and the chicken fried steak.   The crab cake was really good but I definitely would have put the salsa on the side. It was too much and it kind of overpower everything. Which didn't let me enjoy the dish.   The chicken fried steak was my hun choice for the day and he was just okay with it. It wasn't something he like too much. Just average.   Overall...good location...cute atmosphere...good service...but just okay food for the price.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I expected far more from a Marriott and I will not stay at this brand again. There are plenty of other places to stay do not stay here unless you like dirt and ants and lots of kids with lots of noise. I don't mind the kids... . It's next to Sesame Place so there are a lot of families here with lots of kids and germs. I came home and got really sick. their cleanliness could use some improvement. I found each of the main hallways dirty. On the way to my first room I passed a very loud room full of kids, besides the trash I saw on the carpet. While I understand this is a hotel near sesame place either they need to do a better job  of cleaning and  soundproofing or they need to find a way to keep the sound levels appropriate. I decided to check out my room anyway,  and discovered I could hear the babies crying on the inside and asked for a new room. Second room, had an ant  in the bathroom.  I did tell the front desk and they offered to switch rooms, again. I thought I would give it a little time and figured I could live with one ant.  However,  little later I went to get ready to wash up for bed and discovered about 10 + more ants in the bathroom.  Did not want to bring them home in my luggage so I again had to request another room. At this point it was late and there were not a lot of available rooms. The two they showed me,  One had  bed sheets that were so wrinkled I could've sworn someone has slept in the bed without it being changed and the second one had a dirty shower floor. Since it was quite late and those are the only options I had to go with one of them. I can tell you I asked for but did not get a refund on this visit. I have never been so disappointed in a Marriott in my life and can never stay at this hotel or this brand again.  I also ended up getting two hours less sleep because of all the moving around which made me tired, and late for work. I'm guessing I got the  very bad head cold either from poorly wash glasses in the room it's self, or from either food or kids at the breakfast,  and as result I was so sick I had to miss two days of work. There are much better  and presumably cleaner, choices in the area.   Also the Marriott reviews on their own website is skewed to their benefit. Because you can only leave a review if you receive a survey and I did not get a survey. So they purposely rule out people who did not have a good experience to make their reviews look better than they actually are.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 1.0

Our waiter was not overly attentive and the food was good (crab cake appetizer, tuna steak with veggies & potato for dinner). We did not have to wait for a table (dinner at 7 on a Thursday night). My only real concerns were the dark parking lot in the back (no rear entrance) and the waiter only wrapped up the meat rather than my entire plate when it was time to go.

"This is a solid establishment. They have consistent service and food.  Since they've updated their menu, it changes seasonally. White Dog sources their ingredients locally where possible and lists their partner farms on the menu.  What you'll find here is new American dishes, classically prepared with welcome twists. Of the times I've been here, I've been disappointed a couple times. Once when they served a mussel dish with very tiny mussels. Other than that, all of the dishes I've tried were surprising and solid. The bolognese is great. Their Kennet Square mushroom soup is excellent; creamy, flavorful and just a little bit of toothy texture to make sure it doesn't get boring. The steak here is good, too. Enjoy the oysters they serve.  In summary, almost anything you order will be prepared well and will satisfy.   Now, let's talk about decor and atmosphere. They have a very robust dog theme throughout the restaurant. There are several rooms and each has a different feel; den, dining room, study, ballroom, garden room. Each has framed paintings of various dog breeds wall-to-wall. That may sound kind of tacky, but they really tastefully carry the dog theme throughout.  They have a bar. Of the cocktails I've tried, I was pleased.  Come here to celebrate a special occasion or when you don't want to be disappointed. The prices are 2.5-3 $-signs, but when you consider a 2 $-sign experience and chance to be disappointed with shoddy preparation, the extra twenty bucks doesn't sound so bad.

"We stayed here at Circus Circus to shoot a wedding here in Reno.   I really loved the stay but was unable to provide 5 stars for a few reasons.  Check-in was extremely long...traveling with a lot of luggage, we spent an hour and a half just standing in line waiting to check in. There needs to be a faster way to check-in, especially when we were able to check out on our TV with our remote.    We loved our room. It was spacious, but dirty. We found blood stains on the comforter and bed linen, and holes. On the travel guide, it was sticky with some sort green hardened slime. That grossed both me and my sister out quite a bit. The bathroom was clean, and it's spacious, with a tub and shower head. Sink is spacious, and extremely clean , perfect for ladies who love their cosmetic and having everything out.    The casino was huge, and we discovered it connected to 2 other hotels and to their casinos and resteraunts which was amazing. Our first night, we ate at the sushi resteraunt in Circus Circus. It wasn't good at all. They told us the wait would be over 45 minutes unless we did the buffet. Reluctantly, we did since we were hungry. There were two woman there since the waitresses there seated both guest for the sushi side and Mexican food side at the same podium. The one girl was very rude, and even came over to me asking me to sit straighter in my chair for people she sat close to me. I have an existing health issue where I can't have my leg tucked under me and it needs to be out somewhat straight, and she slammed a chair in to my leg. The buffet was not good at all. I craved sashimi, and all you could order for the buffet without being charged more, was sushi rolls....ugh what? For nearly $30 per person, we could only order rolls? The fish is not fresh at all, being a sushi fanatic, I was extremely disappointed. They microwave a lot of the food, so when we ordered rolls, it would be cold and hot, with piece of tempura or fish steaming hot and the rest cold. It was hard for my taste buds to process. For 2 people for the buffet, and an order of sake, the total was almost $80. Way over priced. I guess we paid for the experience.    The buffet inside Circus Circus was amazing. We tried that on our second night, and that night it was ""seafood"" night. They had an assortment of seafood dishes, calamari picatta, crab legs, seafood salads, seafood enchiladas, fried fish, and even general buffet assortments such as potatoes, French fries, ham, and other meats. Their dessert bar was wonderful, an assortment of tiny little colorful desserts, they also have pie, and ice cream.

Great place for groups   Date place? -   not a great date place,, but good for 2 couples to get together or for a group of friends.   Only reason I say that is because there is no intimate tables,, so you're pretty much like in the middle of a party - which makes it fun.  OVERALL -  Its a good time.

I started to speak, to let her know that I had already paid, she interrupted and said: ""You already paid didn't you...ok here is your copy"" (she rolls her eyes). I smile at her to hopefully encourage her with my non-verbals.   She responds with ""Ugh, anyway, I don't even care. Have a good day."" She then roller-bladed into the path of a moving vehicle and she stopped. I'm assuming she wanted to be hit, because she sat there for a few moments.    Her life was spared and she skated back onto the sidewalk into the safety of her burger making nightmare.    In short-- this may have been the most emotionally draining and darkest Sonic experience I've ever had.   Americas Drive In!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

The cubano was also just okay. Again, it was just high quality meats. They didn't prepare the food in an extremely tasty way.

Terrible food and service. I will say that they have the poached egg down solid. But the rest is less than desirable. I had the smoked salmon Benedict with a citrus hollandaise sauce. The sauce was broken and gritty the baguette they use is dipped in French toast batter giving a strange sweetness aside the acid of the sauce not very delicious. The bread was chewy the salmon was fine but I'm sure out of a package so can't mess that up. Tried the croissant flaky buttery nice. Toast was toast the preserves a strawberry and orange marmalade were ok but nothing to rave any organic grocer have the same flavor in jars. Banana foster french toast too chewy and rum syrup was reduced to tar like texture. Cat Cora may be a iron chef but missed the mark here. Avoid.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Went to diner here this past Friday night. Waited approximately 10 minutes for a table, The hostess told me this was her first week on the job but I must say she was very pleasant and caring. She kept telling us the spot we were in for the next available table which I liked. We sat down and ordered some appetizers. We ordered the mega fries which were out of this world, so tasty. And mozzarella cheese sticks which were freshly made and tasted great. And I got boneless barbecue chicken which were so good. 3 of us got panni bread barbecue chicken and one got a Stromboli. All of these were um so good. This is like our 6th time here with this new owner and he has sure turned the taste of food around from the previous owner.

The service was warm and friendly. Our server was wonderfully accommodating to me and my children. She was a very lovely person who started our dining experience off wonderfully. I wish I could remember her name. She had long dark hair pulled back. Excellent server!  The lobster sandwich was delicious, the calamari appetizer was very tasty, and the lobster carbonara was fantastic. The clam chowder might have been the best chowder we have ever had, wonderfully creamy with big chunks of clams. The breadsticks were good but plain warm sourdough would be better. We are seasoned San Francisco tourists and that is our opinion.  Overall, a lovely experience.

"Beware whoever is in the kitchen has a heavy hand when it comes to heat. We ordered our pad Thai medium and they were Xtra spicy. To me spice levels are usually no spice, mild which is a little spice, medium somewhere in btwn, hot which is full on spice and xtra spicy which is for insane people. My spice tolerance is not that low, I eat bahn mi with jalape√±os and order everything at every Thai, Cambodian, Chinese, schezuan, Vietnamese, Indian and Eithiopian ""medium"" but this was inedible. We took a couple bites and were dying. Also the pad Thai didn't have enough sauce it was dry, the chicken was try and undercooked and it was a little bland, maybe because all we were tasting was spice but it could have used some more sugar, lime, tamarind, fish sauce, peanut, herbs etc. very disappointed for $35 worth of food, crispy spring rolls were fine and summer rolls were actually decent.

"My husband and I were staying nearby and since it had a high rating on Yelp and Trip Advisor, we decided to try it. After looking at the online menu, I was all primed for some comfort food. That showed risotto, corn on the cob, many pastas, soups, and a variety of others. When we arrived we were given a one page menu... I asked about the online menu and the server said it hadn't been updated in years. They had discontinued most of the items; there were 3 entrees and a choice of sandwiches on the back. My husband ordered the bison burger and fries... Which were way too salty and could not be eaten. I ordered the Reuben, and could eat maybe 1/2 due to the fat on the meat and I also had fries and a sauce that was way too hot (spicy) to dip them in - our server said he would come back and switch it out but that never happened!

And my husband highly recommended this place, since he had tried the one in San Clemente  We ordered for take out, the tortellini, the jumbo ravioli, the fettuccine and the fusilli with pesto. Arrived at the hotel and everyone opened their own ordered.  First I noticed that my fusilli didn't had the creamy pesto,and I was looking for the pine nuts..... Instead, I see a creamy red sauce, mushrooms, and chunks of sausage. So I gave it a tried, still waiting for the pesto flavor.... Although the pasta was excellent, that was not my ordered. The box said the correct order, but instead of pesto, they served fusilli with pork sausage and mushrooms.  So my only downfall was not to look inside each box ( they close the boxes without you looking and placed them into plastic bags)  And their downfall is not double checking that the order is correct.  I enjoyed it, but my craving for pesto was not satisfied.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

We were short two people and I can understand the logic, but there were at least 4 open toppers with a minimum of two and maximum of six seats 3. It's small and it's hard to navigate through. Again, not much you can do about it, but it's something I don't like  This is a BYOT, the blood orange margarita was meh, but the pineapple version was great!

Here is the setup; we walk in, and are informed there is a 30 minute wait (no big deal) and then they say we can sit in the bar area (again no big deal). The problem is a group of really drunk guys made our experience awful. We got an education regarding F bombs, air humping, and general filth all night.

I  wrote a review about P.F. Changs  awhile back.  I  prayed   that a P.F. Changs would open up near me.   I kept driving past Pei Wei with a heavy judgement until I discovered  it was owned by P.F. Changs.  My nickname for Pei Wei  is  P.F. Changs  Junior.   Now I   can only report about  the takeout.   It is  pretty good.  Not as great as P.F. Changs.    One thing I love about Pei Wei is the tofu strips they put into  the dishes.  I have had the Pei Wei  Spicy with tofu several times.  It is chewy and full of flavor- not  like regular tofu which is gelatinous and yucky.  I  wish  they would package  their tofu and sell it in the grocery store.  My guess is that they partial  dehydrate  marinated tofu and then  deep fry it.    I  also love the Lo Mein  with shrimp although it is  a little on the sweet side.   Service is super speedy.  I  go there  at off  hours  and only have had to wait at the most ten minutes  after placing my order.  It would be great  if P.F. Changs would open up a few more locations closer to me than Plymouth Meeting Mall  but   I understand they have to be in  places that have  huge parking lots.  So for now I am happy with Pei Wei as a quick alternative to his daddy.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

The last time there, I ordered food to go and they not only got it wrong but the an item we ordered wasn't even offered on the day ordered it. The person who took the call likely was new or wasn't completely was familiar with the menu, and tried to get someone else to take down the order; however, said everyone was busy and couldn't take the call now. This is why they got the order wrong. When I came to pickup, we saw the order wasnt what we ordered so they recommended a substitute, but it was way more expensive and another 20 minute wait.

"My family of 4 visited Botto's Italian Restaurant on a Saturday evening around 5:45 pm. We were greeted by a hostess who had her head leaning on on her hand while leaning on the hostess stand, half eaten cake and cell phone to her side. She asked if she could help us. Strange, but, we are seated right away and the dining area is completely empty. The server got our drinks and took our order very quickly, explaining to us that the menu has changed, that all items are now a la carte. This means that salads and soups are an additional charge if ordering. (This was our second time at Botto's in the past 3 months and had previously ordered from a larger menu and had a generally nice experience despite having very slow service.) I ordered a crab cake with asparagus and a not-so-tasty-sounding additional side of tomatoes and onions to round out the plate. My daughter ordered the chicken parm. These are the two dishes of note. The chicken parm was an extremely small portion as well as the side of linguine. The portion size versus the price did not equate. My small crab cake was delivered with some sort of dark leafy green that I assumed was spinach and the other unappetizing looking side. I ordered the crab cake specifically for the asparagus and it was not delivered nor was I told that it was not available. When I questioned the server he went back to the kitchen and five minutes later returned asking if he could get me something else. I said yes, and he disappeared returning another 5 minutes later with a menu. After all this time I finally tried my $22 small crab cake and was very disappointed. The crab was old and the cake itself was 75% filler. The server finally brought out some broccoli after a 10 minute wait and it was not edible. It was very salty and oily. I admit I was angry at this point and might not have been satisfied with anything, but the other 2 adults at my table tried it and were equally disgusted. The server sent over his manager which again took some time and he did not apologize, but admitted that I should have been told that there was no asparagus for my meal and should have been offered a substitute. He offered me a dessert or drink which I refused wanting to get out of the restaurant asap. My husband piped in and asked for some sort of allowance for not having a full meal delivered and for the bad experience to which the manager replied he would do something. He ended up removing a kid's meal price from the bill. My family and I won't return to this restaurant.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

Devon Seafood Grill is located in Rittenhouse Square Philadelphia.  The interior can best be described as a modern and upscale New England Pub.  There is a circular bar in the Center of the room with tables lining the windows looking out onto Rittenhouse Square.  It's hip and inviting with delicious food.

It was bland bland bland. I hope we just got the wrong order because there was nothing orange about it. This was a delivery order.

"Let me start off by saying this place does not care about their customers. Placed an order online for a certain strain and I waited about two hours before I was able to pick up my order. I show up and I pick the order. On my way home I notice that the order I received was not the order I placed. This place modified my order without even reaching out to me. After trying to dispute the issue Kyle the ""manager"" was very unprofessional and stated that they ran out of the strain I had originally ordered. So instead of reaching out they went ahead and gave me a strain that they saw fit. Which was a very low in thc compared to what I had originally placed an order for. Kyle also said that they are not going to change the strain since that was the order they received on the website. Which was a lie. Because I ordered a completely different stain. But apparently I'm wrong and an idiot? I remember what I ordered. Do not question people's intelligence!! But it was easy for them to change my order for me? Please save yourself and do not come to this awful place that doesn't care about their customers. This was truly an awful experience and I was robbed. I will never be coming here again. How dare you take my money and not fix the mistake you awful people made. Especially you Kyle. You truly need to be taught on how to be a manager for customer service. Back talking customers during CSIs and stealing people's money. Not allowing customers to change the order you decided to modify. BEWARE EVERYONE PLEASE.

"Have you ever seen the television show ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate?"" Well, I had that type of experience this morning when I happily devoured my breakfast bowl.  The breakfast bowl, as described on District's menu, is smoked gouda grits, roasted pork belly, roasted tomato, roasted potatoes, dressed arugula with a sunny side up egg. Wow! They had me at pork belly. This was simply one of the most delicious meals I've ever eaten...ever! The grits were creamy and cheesy, the roasted potatoes tender, and the tomatoes juicy, bursting with flavor, and I don't even like tomatoes. The pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth tender, egg flavorful and arugula was arugula. Probably the healthiest part of the meal.  What worked? Every ingredient was well seasoned. It literally blew me away.   What didn't? The price. For all it's deliciousness, at $9.50, the bowl was wayyyy overpriced. It was grits for crying out loud. The pork belly was good, but it was only about 1.5 inches. Two measly tomatoes, about three small potatoes, some sprinkled leaves, an egg and maybe three serving spoons of grits. Not a good value by a long shot.  To put this in perspective, for $2.99, I can get a half container of grits, about 6 pieces of bacon, and eggs from Triangle Deli.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"VerdicTL;DR: Korean slow food fast.  A touch of spice in the crossroads of the Great American Melting Pot that is Indiana.  This is has to be one of the most quintessentially American establishments in existence.  Korean homemade cuisine, served up in a combinatorial fashion not dissimilar from Chipotle or Qdoba, with the tendency to (a) delight the taste buds and the belly of the adventurous and (b) offend the sensibilities of those who seek ""authenticity"" (never mind the fact that none of the people who throw these barbs are, well, authentically Korean themselves).  It is an alloy of so many different elements, made *stronger* by the differences, not *weaker*.  And in these times where our very own elected officials invite America to reject the very differences that make us great in favor of some imagined purity that never once historically existed, restaurants like these are reminders of what America is like at its very best.  I am a Korean, born in Korea, raised in Korea.  I arrived in this country when I was 14.  I remember so vividly my first day in this land -- and I remember the awkward, often wrenching process by which I lost most of my identity as a Korean (and gained, I should add, an identity as an American).  I remember what it felt like to renounce my Korean citizenship in order to become naturalized as a citizen of this country.  I remember the hard stares, I remember the insults, I remember the racism, I remember staring into the dark heart of what would later crystalize into the ""alt-right"".  But this I also know: this is still a land where it is possible for people to transcend the accidents that are their births, where your worth need not be determined by who your parents were, or by the caste from which you come.  This is still a land that has the capacity to embrace its immigrants, to integrate and celebrate the unique characteristics not only of those who were born Americans, but also of those who *became* Americans.  This is still a land of opportunity, of risk, and of a certain kind of freedom that doesn't exist in many other places.  This is still -- and I pray will always be -- the country that I love.  Omoni's food is authentically Korean and authentically American, all at once.  The lady who runs this place?  She's half-Korean, half-white, all-American.  The food she serves?  Passed down from the hands of her Korean mother, and lovingly made with a tenderness that you can both taste and feel.  This is a place that wants to nourish you, show you what happens when you embrace the differences that make us unique, display to you what it can mean when we get out of our ideological trenches and meet in the center.  A place where Asian spices meld with food prep and mise en place techniques derived from fast-serve Mexican, open to all.  A place whose heart is so wide-open that every comment is taken to heart, whether for good or for bad.  And hey Omoni?  No matter what some might say, know that in your very own, very small, very special way, you give me hope for this country.  Because you see, leaders come and leaders go.  The tumult and the fury of the present will become mere footnotes in the sweep of history.  The Greatest Generation and the Baby Boomers will exit stage-left, and the Millennials and Gen Z will enter stage-right.  You want to talk to me of ""authenticity""?  To be ""authentic"" in culinary terms is to be frozen in time, a dead artifact that suffocates rather than enlightens.  We can do better than that.  Omoni does better than that.  Look around you: if there is darkness behind you, darkness to the left of you, darkness to the right of you, darkness above you, and before you there is only a storm, then what of it?  It takes incredible pressure, intense heat, and so much perseverance to make strong alloy steel.  To be American is to embrace that smelting process no matter how painful, no matter what the cost.  We are a nation of ideas put into action; not too long ago we fought a bloody Civil War over the issue of slavery; not too long before that we fought a Revolutionary War over the issue of whether a foreign power would control us.  So let us enter that storm together -- and press forward knowing that on the other side is the joy of morning.  This is America, where we are stronger together.  And this is Omoni, where the culinary traditions are tastier together.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

The special this morning was a chile relleno, two eggs, home fried potatoes, and tortillas, and all three of us selected this.  This was one of the better chile rellenos we've had in the area, and the prices were very reasonable.  Apparently, the owner used to be one of the cooks at the Marie Callender's here in Reno, and in addition to being a good cook, he also takes special orders for any kind of pie.  Since we live only a couple miles away, I think this will become our ""go to"" place when we decide not to cook and just go out to get something to eat.  They're open 7 days a week serving breakfast, lunch and dinner, have a lot of choices on the menu at very reasonable prices (a glass of wine is about $5, for example), and it's a pleasure eating at a restaurant which is not just another in the chain.

"Enjoyed a good dinner here on a quiet Tuesday night. 3 stars for the food, but the great service bumped it up to 4 for us. The chef came out to greet and chat with us, and even gave us some free baklava. Awesome dude.   If it's your first time visiting, I'd recommend getting the mixed meze, and one of the mixed grill plates. It's a nice, approachable way to try a whole bunch of their offerings.   The mixed meze consists of their 6 cold dip apps, and is served with warm pita. Of course, some of these are better than others, but all are certainly worth trying.   The mixed grill comes with chicken, beef, lamb kabob, lamb chops, and kofte, which are like little, flavorful hamburger patties. This meat extravaganza is accompanied by a house salad, some refreshingly chilled yogurt soup, onion salad, bulgur rice pilaf, their spicy pepper dip, roasted veggies, and warm pita. It was all good, but kind of basic, and nothing really stood out our wowed, unfortunately. The kofte was probably my favorite of the meats.  On the other hand, the baklava was some of the best I've had! Definitely worth getting, and an awesome end to our meal!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I have been here a few times and I would have to say this place is just okay. The service is always hit or miss. They do have a lot of seating options because the place is pretty big. They have the elaborately carved booths and the flashy murals. It's pretty inexpensive here. They have some starters that aren't really Mexican, but more American. So if you have someone in your party who doesn't totally love Mexican food, that's a nice option for them. The arroz con pollo is pretty good here. Nothing in particular has really stood out to me. I personally think there are better Mexican restaurants in the area with better specials, food, and friendlier staff.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Yesterday, after a nice lunch date with my daughter, I decided to stop by MAC and grab my foundation and concealer quickly since I was out and already at the mall. I made a decision while leaving the Cheesecake Factory that I immediately regretted once I walked into the MAC store at Dillard's. I have to clarify here because for whatever ridiculous reason, there are TWO MAC stores within the same tiny mall. But I digress.   Upon entering the store, an (Asian - used solely to describe her bc this is as much as I got out of my 10 mins in the store to describe her) employee immediately ignored and avoided all contact with me. She made it a point not to ever look up or greet me from her very important time with her ""client."" After about 10 minutes of hovering, I finally asked her if anyone else was working. She quickly made sure I knew that she was the only person working and she couldn't help me. ""Even if I know EXACTLY what I need?"" She, with her less than stellar customer centric attitude, let me know again she was with a client and I absolutely would not be able to purchase what I needed until she was finished. For the love of God, why didn't she just bust out that nugget of information BEFORE I stood there and waited for 10 minutes.   Now, I get it. You're busy slathering makeup on some reaaallllly important middle-of-a-Monday afternoon ""client's"" face. But you can't be serious. When a customer knows exactly what they want, politely remove yourself from your uber important Monday makeover and let your customer purchase it.

"Demographics: I'm 70 years old, enjoy a little slot play, and dislike venues like stadiums and arenas. The Xcite Center, though it is a large theater, is more intimate than the type of venues I dislike. Located in the Parx Casino in Bensalem, PA, it is very accessible by automobile, although if you plan to park using Valet, go very early and be prepared to wait. There is plenty of standard parking available, but limited handicap spaces. This fact could have been an issue for us since one of our party was using a wheelchair, but we got fortunate in finding a good space not too far from the front door.  The seats are very comfortable and most seats provide a reasonably good view. The on-line ticket service provides options, but the center area, even if you have to sit further back, is best. The only issue with the seating is that the elevation from row to row is rather flat. I had a fairly tall gentleman in front of me with a very large head after having to change seats with my wife. I found myself swaying from side to side to see, but the stage is large enough that I did not always have to try to look through him.   The sound system is terrific... first rate, as is the lighting. The ushers are polite and access inside is organized. The wheelchair was removed from our party and we were provided a receipt. We retrieved it after the show was over.  The Xcite center may not be the Kimmel Center, but it is an enjoyable place to see a show and maybe lose some money before or after. We will be back.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 4.0
"The food and service was spectacular yet affordable. The Blue Duck menu has the spice and delicious quirks you'd expect in a new University City spot, yet its conveniently located in the Northeast!   All of the service staff were friendly and on point. I think our waitress could read minds- she knew exactly when to walk over and take our orders. She even brought us go boxes without us needing to ask.    Two tips:  Make reservations, but don't be deterred if you forget. We had a 20 min wait for a late dinner.   Be prepared for a loud restaurant at peak hours. I think they need to do more to absorb noise in the room because this place is kind of small and very noisy when full.

Maybe the pasta is just a smidge overcooked... I can't quite figure it out.

Every flavor can be tasted in every bite without overwhelming the taste of the juicy beef. Add some mayo, onions, tomato and lettuce and you're in juice running down your arm heaven. This burger is not for the faint of heart! Keep your pantie  hose at home because you will get messy.  The staff were very friendly and attentive, however, the patrons were a little sketch.

"Heard about this place from the news and online reviews. We were curious because the owners may be opening a restaurant in our neighborhood (West University) and we wanted to check it out. My wife and I visited on Friday evening for dinner and the food was underwhelming. I ordered the porkchop which was dry and tasted like I was eating a block of salt. My wife had somethng I can not remember because it was that forgetable. We opted to not stay for dessert and went over to Vivace's. We live near downtown and generally stick to restaurants within walking distance of our house. If you are traveling out to St. Philip's Plaza, don't make the trip just for Union Public House. There are many, many, many better options in Tucson for a Friday evening dinner at the $80 for two price range.   I was also eager to check out their Scotch selection because they run ""whisky Wednesdays."" Although the Scotch selection is better than your average bar, it was still a pedestrian tour of major Scotch (Macallan, Lagavulin, Talisker, Aberlor, Ardbeg, Compass Box's Peat Monster were the interesting selections that come to mind). Lots of Glenfiddich and Glenlivet selections. There is no such thing as a bad Scotch, but the whisky selection was pretty boring! If I am going to pay for a glass at a place with Public House in the name who have a weekly whisky night, they better bring something more to the table!  The only way this place makes sense is if you live in the Foothills with no other nearby options for a drink and dinner.

I ordered the plain, ordinary poutine (appetizer) as a main meal.  I've had poutine all over God's green earth, and this may be the best ever.  Nothing fancy, just a lot (but not too much) cheese and gravy.  A co-worker had a grilled meatloaf sandwich.  That was a winner!  We liked it so much, that we went back for lunch the next day...where we started things off with fried mushrooms.  I've had better fried mushrooms at only one place (some wing joint in Tyrone, GA).  Then it was time for an assortment of tacos.  There really isn't anything much better than a good fish taco, and they had broiled fish and fried fish tacos.  Jackpot!

"For the location and price, this hotel is okay. It's fairly close to the Broadway bars (only about a ten minute uber away), but that's where the good things about this stay ended.  I had requested two double Queen Sized rooms when I booked online. When we received our keys at check in, this is what I was expecting. We went up to our rooms only to find that for six people, two couples and two single individuals, there were two King Sized rooms. Talk about awkward. I had to go back down to the concierge and ask if we could get switched to the rooms that I had asked for. The lady at the desk acted as if this was a major inconvenience for her and told me that they only had one double Queen room available. We ended up taking it but that meant that the two single individuals in our group had to share the king sized room. This was mildly annoying.  In addition to the room fiasco, the rooms themselves were so dated and worn. There were marks on the walls, dirt on the floor in the bathroom, and the bathtub drain barely did it's job. It always left an inch of water in the tub after one person showered. Pretty gross.   If you need a cheap place to stay and are willing to put up with possibly not getting the rooms that you booked, this is your place. Just don't expect much more than a bed to sleep in and a place to park.

Even drumroll from Odell.   They've also got a full menu of their specialty drinks and takes on classics. We got the green tea Jameson drinks.

The beef with basil is another great item with a hearty brown basil sauce.  I didn't much care for the beef with broccoli when I had it. Though the flavor was as expected with fresh broccoli pieces, the beef wasn't as tender as one might expect with Chinese beef with broccoli.

"I have been to dozens of professional receptions and my recollection of the food is that it's always predictable.  The cheese plate, the dry meat plate, the bland potsticker...etc.  For some reason there's no oomph in catering and as a foodie it's always a disappointment... then I was introduced to LocalStove.  Wahoo!  I was delighted to find a variety of diverse ethnic foods as an option for catering.  I used LocalStove personally for a small family gathering and it was a seamless, easy as pie experience.  Jackie reached out to me promptly and helped me coordinate how much food I should be ordering for 7 hungry adults.  I selected a number of dishes by one chef and along the way we hit a small road bump.  Chef got sick and had to be excused from cooking that weekend.  Before I was aware of the issue, Jackie took over and coordinated a brand new menu for me without my having to mull over the website.  Her suggestions were spot on and instead of eating Vietnamese food, my family got to try papusas which was new to them.  It was fun for my in-laws to try something new and different in the comfort of our home.    The food was delivered on time, the dishes were flavorful, and the cost was not over the top as far as catering goes.  For 7 adults, if we went to a restaurant and paid for multiple appetizers, entrees, and alcoholic drinks, it would have exceeded the catering cost by far.  I really like the fact that I did not have to slave over the stove to feed a group and therefore was able to talk to my family and enjoy myself.

"I needed a room for an overnight trip to Philadelphia and the Renaissance hotel was perfect for our needs.   The lobby was beautiful and modern and checking in was an absolute breeze. The front desk staff was very courteous and we were actually having some nice conversation while I was checking in which is refreshing.   I got to the room and I was pleasantly surprised by the size of it for the money that I paid. The king bed was pretty comfortable and the pillows were soft.   These guys deserve a 5/5 for a customer service- First, I forgot my toothbrush and the staff at the front desk immediately provided me with one and toothpaste.   Second- My girlfriend had an upset stomach from some food we ate outside of the hotel, I called the front desk to see if they had any saltine crackers or club soda. They had ginger-ale and so I went downstairs to the front desk, the man behind the desk handed me both cans and I pulled some cash to pay him for them and he would not take it. It's small things like this that make a place truly great and I cannot thank them enough for their generous hospitality.   The only reason why I took off a star was because I think the rooms could use some updating as compared to their modern lobby.   I will certainly be back if I need a place to stay again in Philadelphia.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 4.0

Come to think of it, I probably had the other best moo shu pork 20 years ago in Clayton or some such place and have kept ordering it and being disappointed all this time.

They need a few more bartenders here, as they seem overworked. However, the bartenders made up for it with their awesome personalities and attentiveness. This place is ridiculously huge, with three floors. I stayed on the first floor most of the time. The band was absolutely amazing, playing a mixture of old and new country. They even did a few songs for the Vets that were in the bar, and it was really heartfelt. This was one of my favorite visited bars while in Nashville.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 4.0

"We went here this past Sunday for my husbands' birthday and so glad we did. At first we almost decided to leave because it was no place to sit. However, one of the guys asked one of the regulars if our family could have his table( he was finished eating by the way). That was very accommodating and we appreciated that. So once we sat down, it wasn't long after that we received our food. We did have to wait for the kids meal a bit but once they got it, it was good! I had a two piece dark meat with two sides and the General Hso's sauce on it. It was pretty good, fried nice and crispy.My husband had the fried fish that was fried perfectly and seasoned well. The only disapproving was that they ran out of Mac and cheese so we weren't able to try that as a side. I had the mashed potatoes and cole slaw as my sides. I liked the cole slaw, but it wasn't my favorite.The mashed potatoes and gravy were very tasty. This place is now apart of our repertoire and we will back. It's also cool that it shares a building with Pappy's Smokehouse. So if you get a craving for ribs and fried chicken, boom! Right there together!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Sure, this is a shady location, but I've never had any issues. And a couple times there was a nice man (perhaps homeless) to open the door for you with a smile on his face. There are two sides on the inside... one much nicer than the other. When I come with work, we sit on the nice side. When I come with friends... the grubby side.

"I would like to start by saying I have been a HUGE fan of Sucr√© for years, and have been awaiting the Salon's opening for months.   I'll start with the positives from my experience. Beautiful decor, polite staff, amazing balcony, and quite safe and quiet for the french quarter.   On the downside: I felt the servers were WAY too stiff, and were trying so hard to be polite and formal that each encounter was more awkward than the last. The menu is much more limited than I expected, as were the cocktails. My biggest issue was some of the food. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but I paid $24 for a handful of frites with aoli and caviar. I have never seen caviar used as a garnish, and as much as I love caviar, I would rather have it on the side so I can enjoy it. Mixed into a sauce, I could only appreciate the saltiness of the eggs. The other items were equally small portions and heart stopping prices.   My party was looking forward to dessert, but after the tiny portions of our meals, we opted to walk downstairs to the cafe for dessert.    Overall, great atmosphere, location, and decor, but I feel they were trying too hard and, in the process, did not realize when to leave good enough alone.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Plusses and minuses.  Horrible start.  I drove in with my handicapped family and found that Hampton has relocated their handicapped parking to the side of the building in order to create spaces for their Diamond members.  Five Diamond spaces.   Not a good start.  I am Marriott Platinum but went to Hampton for business reasons.  I would cancel my membership with Marriott if they moved their handicap spots for me.  I can walk a few extra steps thank you but every extra step for my family is a burden.   Hampton said they built ramps for us but that really isn't the point is it.   This is leading with your chin.  Front desk help was excellent.  Hats off to Kathleen, Kelsey, and Steve.  We skipped Uber because Hampton has drop off and pick up service.  Bad idea.

A little time ago I stopped by to see if they had any fresh baked bread.  The young man behind the counter said they were all out and claimed there's was the best bread around.  I asked my wife to stop by and pick up a loaf but when she brought it home the bread is hard a good 2 inches past the crust and when you toast it on the lowest setting it gets super hard and crumbly.  Obviously they sold her some old bread which is a complete shame as it looked good and almost reminded me of the bread we used to bake back home.

"If I could give this place 0 stars I would, but it would be because of management aka GAIL. I ordered a meatball parm and got a chicken parm (it happens, we're all human and make mistakes) so I told the waitress and to make this story short we asked for the manager and we requested we get the right sandwich to go at no charge or we get the incorrect meal at no charge since we initially didn't get what we wanted and our lunch was pretty much over well the manager stated we can get the meatball parm (that they started making for us already) and she'll make the waitress pay for it. And we were shocked, it was a human mistake and she was going to make this girl pay for it, waitresses barely get paid as is. We let her know how unpleased we were with her way of resolving this issue, how we never went to a restaurant who couldn't spared a $6 sandwich, how we never heard of a restaurant charging their employees for taking an incorrect order, how they make great money being in a busy location and just having remodeled a few years ago, and how we will not take the sandwich if she was going to make the waitress pay for it. When we went up to pay we asked Gail, who lacked sincerity in her apologies, what are they going to do with the sandwich they started making well she changed her story and said they hadn't started it. Gail is a liar, doesn't care about the customers, and lacks sincerity. We apologized to the waitress, who ended up crying, about her crappy manager and told her not to let them charge her for it because we didn't take it, it wasn't about the sandwich it was about the way management treats their customers and employees and I refuse to go back.

"Since my reviews are becoming famous (more like infamous), I plan on elaborating as much as possible on this recent visit to Sizzler.  Before I get started....""Hey Shooter...Wanna go to Sizzler????????""  If that just made you LOL, awesome!  If not, stop reading my review.............now!  Of course the place is clean.  We started our visit around 11:05AM and they open at 11:00AM.  We actually drove by the front door to make sure they were still in business since there was NO ONE in the parking lot.  We were happy when we found the front doors unlocked and entered for some grindage.  Ordering was easy.  The person taking our order knew what she was doing but asked way too many questions!  Not the fault of the employee but Sizzler orders have too damn many options and asks too many questions.  Sizzler also serves Pepsi products so God Forbid you ask for a Coke.  Epic fail!  All four of us ordered the salad bar and at Sizzler, always a good idea......except this time.  As a caveat, we have visited the Boise Town Center Sizzler location multiple times so we are not new to the Sizzler experience.  We all found the salad bar lacking, small and the overall area claustrophobic.  I didn't say anything to anyone in our party about my epic fail feelings while at Sizzler.  It wasn't until many hours later we all agreed we've had better.  Personally, dessert is a big deal to me at salad bars/buffets.  I attempted to get some ice cream but when I pulled the chocolate ice cream lever, I received liquid, inedible chocolate.  HUH????  I know what ice cream looks and tastes like and today Sizzler....YOU FAILED!!!!  We visited this Sizzler location today because we spent the couple hours prior at Settlers Park.  Lesson learned.

"March 15, 2014-I attended an air show at the Clearwater Air Park off Hercules Avenue in Clearwater. It was a sunny and very warm Saturday and I had seen a promo on WTSP so I headed over before noon. It's great to see so many families and children. Owners of local single planes were giving tours and rides. The US Coast Guard gave tours of their Orange & white helicopter and the medical helicopter ""Bayflight,"" was there as well.  I have always wanted to ride in a helicopter so when I visited Tampa Bay Aviation and realized a single flight was quite affordable ($39) I jumped at the chance. There was a short wait and my anticipation built until I entered the copter with blades spinning. An 8 year old boy sat in the front next to the pilot and I comfortably in the rear next to the boy's father.  I've flown a lot domestically on wide bodied jets but never in a copter so I didn't know what to expect.   The pilot provided us with noise eliminating headphones so we could talk to each other. We couldn't hear any engine noise. As we lifted off until we returned 10-15 minutes later the ride was smooth as silk. We were cruising at 1,000 feet as we headed toward Clearwater Beach, then we flew south over Sand Key and headed back. From this outstanding viewpoint we saw the aqua colored Gulf, the white sandy beaches, the intracoastal waterway, downtown Clearwater, the marinas, Island Estates north to Dunedin-we saw it all!  It was definitely worth the price of admission. What a value.   I highly recommend Tampa Bay Aviation.

This really was upsetting because it just made no sense.  The third time was more of the same.  This pace could be really successful if they get their act together.  prices are reasonable and about the same as most nail places.   They really need to get their customer service issues under control.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 2.0
"We read other reviews and thought it might be a good place to check out. The first night Kevin was our server. He was very courteous. We were not hungry so decided to share the house salad and the Kobe sliders. It was fantastic!! The next night we decided to go back and met Vanessa our server. We tried the Caesar salad, the lamb chops, and the scallops with risotto. It was amazing!! What a wonderful experience!! Thank you Vanessa for your suggestion on the scallops with risotto!! We are fortunate to have stumbled onto this place. Service was awesome!! Thank you Vanessa!! We will let our family and friends know about this special place.

This place is definitely the first nail salon I've found that I want to be a regular. I called them up to make a pedicure appointment for me and my mom and they were incredibly accommodating.   I'm very indecisive about nail color but I know my style. I let them know what I was looking for and my nail stylist provided great insight and the perfect suggestion. I love the time they took on our nails and my mom even booked a hair appointment for the next day. Her hair turned out fantastic and she adores it so much.   A great tip they suggested was that their Groupon price is the same price they offer in person.,Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 5.0
"I dine in here frequently with my significant other. I love it. Food is great, the La Colombe coffee is great, the smooties are great. The service and their attentiveness is A+ (if you come in when they open) because no matter what day of the week it is, the place ALWAYS gets packed between 9 am to 12 pm. They have some vegan/vegatarian options, which is good. I'm giving this 5 stars because of my own experience and the fact that a few of the staff remembers us. Keep in mind that this is a CASH ONLY restaurant. I've seen guests complain about not knowing or not being informed and would walk out. You just missed out on some good freakin' breakfast, friend. It says 'cash only' on the menu but for your inconveniance; there is an ATM on sight. Happy Brunch!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"I really wish my experience was a better one. The food was awesome but the service was very sub par. The waitress was so scattered. And kept asking my 6 year old child if he wanted something different that I ordered. Ex: ""he will have water"" she asks ""do you want chocolate milk"" of course he says yes. And the same thing happened with his waffle (add chocolate chips) I could have reiterated a NO but I knew it would cause tears from my little guy. So now I will deal with his behavior issues. And the fact that he wouldn't even eat the waffle (just like i knew he wouldn't) and then she and another man began arguing about delivering food to tables (he also worked there, I think, there is no want to distinguish employees from those dining) very unprofessional in my opinion.   It would have been nice if the jam was labeled in my biscuit basket (that came late) or if I have actually gotten the gravy I ordered. Luckily the lady checking out gave us a break on the bill. She was very nice and apologetic.   As I said-- WONDERFUL FOOD, terrible service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Located in west Nashville's newest mixed-use development, One Bellevue Place, HoneyFire BBQ is convenient to west Nashvillians. But don't discount it if its not down the street. This restaurant is worth the drive. It features patio seating, a limited bar and great menu. (www.honeyfire.com)  HoneyFire BBQ is locally owned by Shane Nasby, who got his start as an accomplished BBQ competitor pit master and catering. His catering business, HoneyFire Kitchen, evolved into a full-blown restaurant after joining forces with a long-time friend turned business partner Ben Claybaker.  Since it was our first visit, I went out on a limb and tried one of the restaurant's favorite menu items: the Diablo Jones sandwich. The hickory-smoked pulled pork had an interesting mix of white queso and deep fried jalape√±os and top secret glaze. The entree comes with two sides. I chose the Bourbon Baked Beans and White Queso Mac. The Mac was great. The Bourbon Baked Beans were good, but not really what I was expecting. The owner stopped by and mentioned they had been tweaking the bean recipe based on customer feedback.  I appreciated the fact the owner was adjusting his menu items based on customer feedback. I think that's one of the advantages of having a locally owned business like this one.   We enjoy barbecue and will absolutely return to try other menu items.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"07/15/21_This is not actually a compliment but an 'ALERT'. I purchased a sofa on 5/27/21 made in VIETNAM. It felt nice on the floor and style looks great. Since owning this sofa the foam insulation has gotten softer. So 'soft' that I am beginning to feel the springs on the seat and along the front stitching the springs are making a more prominent line. I stopped by the store today to ask if I had any 'options'. NO...this sofa has 'NO WARRANTY'.  My Review is to ""WARN"" other Buyers NOT TO BUY THIS SOFA.  It will be a waste of your money.  Like they always tell you, 'you get what you pay for'. I do like Matter Brothers Outlet and their Employees, they don't do the buying, only sell what the Brothers Buy.

"Mmmm yeah, don't go here.   Well, if you want tasteless, watered-down beef (literally - they pour water on the grill while it's cooking, I'm guessing to create the illusion of juicy beef?) on a day-old roll with skimpy fixings, served up with a hearty dose of racial tension then yes, go here.  I went to Jim's like 6 years ago on my first trip to Philly and remember it being slightly better than this pig slop. Fast forward to last weekend when we were in town and my friend wanted an ""authentic"" cheese steak. First off, the dude making our sandwiches mixed them up, causing us to be out of line when we paid.

"Fantastically disappointed and wished I had made more of a point about it rather than just paying! I went for lunch and had been recommended the BBQ shrimp.  Since I was having an early dinner I wanted a smaller portion and decided to go with the shrimp sandwich instead of the entr√©e size without the bread since I have to be gluten free. The waiter asked me if I had wanted the shrimp pealed or not since the ones that come on the sandwich are smaller and pealed. I decided to try the unpeeled ones since I was visiting and wanted the full experience. The sandwich comes with soup or salad the soups had gluten so I went with the salad. The salad was over dressed tiny and soggy. The shrimp come out and was a bigger portion than expected but I figured maybe they threw a few in since I wasn't getting bread and the bowl did still have fewer shrimp than other diners. I tried to enjoy them but they were bland and did not seem fresh :( the heads were falling off, never a good sign and some of them were mushy. Then I was in for a huge surprise when I got the bill they had charged me for the entr√©e which was $26,  $11 more than the price of the sandwich AND charged me for a side salad! I was pissed I asked them about it and they said they were sorry about the misunderstanding and took the bill and my card. They left me waiting for over 10 minutes I was hopeful they would be somewhat helpful with the bill BUT NO! While I waited they handed the bill to and cleaned up three other tables who left before I got my bill back and they had charged the full amount to my card! WTH... I was just so completely done I left no tip and left, in retrospect I wish I had complained more... Please avoid if in the area...",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
Bayona is a Cattle call.    We were seated in the upstairs wine tasting room with a window AC unit blowing on our backs--on a chilly December night. Presumably the restaurant does not have permission to serve dinner in the room because there was not a single fire exit sign as required by the New Orleans Fire Department.  The room is a death trap.  Be prepared to be treated as though the restaurant and staff are doing you a favour by serving you.   The appetizers and salads were brought at the same time to hurry us along and then we waited 30 minutes for the underdone mains to arrive.  Why does a popular restaurant need to stuff customers into every corner until the staff and kitchen cannot help but resent them?  The Owner's greed is palpable.

They mumbled; it was almost impossible to understand what they said!  It made myself and my husband feel unwanted and uncomfortable.    I asked for my tacos without cheese, and reminded them 3-4 times.  My tacos had cheese.  When I mentioned it, they seemed annoyed, and just took a handful off the top of one.  My husband's burrito had the same amount of filling as a tiny taco.  We ordered chips and queso, and when we walked out with our food, realized that they didn't give us any chips!  We went back in and asked for chips, and they didn't even mutter a word of apology; just went in the back and got chips.  The chips were the worst I've ever had; stale and unsalted.

"I wanted to disagree with every review that let rain dismay on this place.  Unfortunately this let me down harder than the ""Brexit"".  I have never had a pizza that was worse than a lunchable.  Seriously, I would rather eat a rubber lunchable pizza than whatever it is that rolled out of that kitchen and into the pizza box.  Where should I begin?  I can only imagine that the dough is mass manufactured, not mixed, manufactured and then unsealed and topped.  The cheese was about 2 steps above play-dough on the rubber scale, and that is being generous.  The pepperoni may have been tasty but I couldn't tell since it was assaulted by atrocious tomato sauce.  Actually I take that back, I am not sure that it was tomato sauce.  It would take work to make tomatoes taste that awful.  Please, if you have any sense of dignity or self worth do not eat a pizza form this place.  P.S. the service was about as bad as can be, ignoring Guests who are standing at the counter while flirting with the kitchen staff is not acceptable.  P.P.S.

Since there was only us and one other party, I expected to get our sushi very quickly. However, it took awhile, and they also put several rolls that multiple people had ordered onto the same plate. This made it difficult for us to tell what was what, and for people to eat the rolls that they had ordered themselves. Aside from that, the fish was not fresh at all. I ordered unagi and it was bland, and the other roll that I ordered was so gross that me and 7 other people couldn't finish finish it.

I came to Diamond Bails with 2 broken nails (one broken on the nail plate which was very painful) and they did more than fix them. I was greeted right away by a young polite girl who was very sweet. She asked what I was getting done and gave me the box of gel polish to look through. I waited for about 15 minutes but considering I called about an hour earlier to make the appointment and they were able to squeeze me in, I had no problem with that. Alex, my nail technician, was very gentle and very polite; often times asking was I ok while trying to fix the damage that had been done. She was very informative in that she explained the process of chrome bails and how long they last  which I thought was very professional. I ended up getting the chrome nails and was in disbelief at how amazing my nails looked. May I add that while she was doing my nails she was also answering the phones, handling the appointments, and greeting customers who were walk ins. What I really appreciated was that when there were no more morning slots left, she told each customer exactly when there would be an opening.

"Although this Mexican restaurant is on a busy street with hardly any parking, it is a must-try if you love Mexican cuisine!   This place always seems to be packed so it is almost a guarantee that there will be a wait. The set-up is a bar that seats about 20 people with the main kitchen being right in front of you. Carlitos and his father prepare your food and you get to watch them zoom around the kitchen.   The menu is packed with breakfast and lunch items, one of the most popular being the breakfast burrito. There is a variety of meats you can choose from like grilled beef, pork carnitas, chorizo (spicy Mexican sausage), etc. The burrito is a mix of meat and potatoes topped with a salsa and melted cheese. Breakfast items are paired with a choice of house potatoes or beans and rice. You can enjoy two different salsas with your order, one green and one red.   The kitchen is always bustling as to-go orders are very popular around lunchtime. If you are not a fan of waiting, try one of their lunch items to-go.   The service here is great as the staff is very friendly and serve you as fast as they can. Carlitos and his father even tend to chat with the regulars as they cook.

A few of us showed up early and were given waters and a place to sit while they finished setting up our reserved table. They could have easily just told us to wait, but instead made sure we were comfortable.   Admittedly, the food took quite a while to get to us but I assumed that's because brunch for 16 on a Sunday in Nashville can take some time to prepare.   I had the French toast and it was exquisite.

"Great dining experience! Went here for a dinner meeting with a fairly large party. I must say our service was impeccable. I also really like the concept that you get a five course meal. We started out with a foie gras soup, then had a choice of the next four choices. Considering that I'm gluten free, some of the choices that I would have liked to pick had breaking on them, but they offered me plenty of other options and even altered a couple of the dishes to my liking. The foie gras soup was amazing! And while I couldn't eat the bread, it looked to die for, especially with the truffle butter. The antipasto salad was delicious as well with very clean but delicious notes of balsamic. The pasta course was very interesting. I ordered risotto which wasn't really risotto at all, it was actually sunflower seeds cooked to taste like risotto with wild mushrooms, a surprising winner. For my entree I had fish",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"10th reviewer of Freak Alley Gallery: Downtown Boise, Idaho.  This is my 384th review on Yelp.  As GOOD as it GETS!   WOW! A local treasure. Seriously! What is Freak Alley Gallery? Its an Alley (obviously) where the walls of buildings are painted by local artists. The paintings change over time.   This is a go-to place for any family or friends visiting. Like I said above-- a local treasure, and I like to show off my treasures. It's nice to get a bite to eat at many of the nearby restaurants, maybe a cocktail or two (or 17) and walk down the Alley and look at the local flavor.   I have three teens and my kids love coming downtown looking at the art.   Please, please, please visit the Alley if you're here in Boise and have never seen it.

I saw the Mr. Rogers documentary and Mean Girls, which was a part of the Rewind series. They did a great job on both events. Mean Girls was a lot of fun because they showed it on Wednesday, October 3 which was pure genius. The theatre was packed with pink. Somebody give that man a raise.

I give negative stars to the management/owners and the restaurant as a whole. Who knows if it was poor planning, or mismanagement, or people calling out, or all of the above but this place never should have opened the doors the day I went and shame on not one manager showing up to help out. Maybe they did later in the day ... but I know I waited for food for 2 hours and watched one waiter serve about 30 people alone with no help. How does this happen?   When it was all said and done, the food was mediocre and about 50% correct.  The server gave a discount for the wait, which was nice.

"We were there last evening with a group (20).    The tables were set with water bottles that were quickly emptied and refilled without ice.  (The air conditioning was not working, so on a day when it was 108 here in Tucson, it was extremely hot in the restaurant. The staff made no comment other than to tell us that the manager had adjusted the thermostat.).  We continually asked for ice to cool the water.  My dining companion ordered the Caesar Salad and Calamari Fritzi, both to be served as dinner when the other orders were served.  I ordered Pollo Formaggio which came with a choice of soup or salad.  My salad arrived cold, crispy and tasty.  The Pollo Formaggio was quite delicious and was served with fettuccine Alfredo, which was also rich and tasty.  My companion's Caesar salad was wilted and served with an unappealing blob of tasteless dressing and the Calamari Fritti was tough and greasy.    We found the service too slow, but perhaps the extreme heat was getting to them in their long sleeved uniforms!  Dinner took over 2 hours.  From placing the orders to the arrival of our dinners took nearly an hour.  It was not a busy night in terms of other diners, but they arrived, received food and left before we did.  I understanding trying to get all 20 meals out at the same time.  The biggest faux pax of the evening was the woman who acted as hostess/owner whom we found later is not the owner...and probably not even Italian as she tried to deceive the group into believing.  Her mispronunciation of Italian words was very telling for those in our group who speak the language and have been to Italy.  Will we return to this restaurant?

"NEVER!  NEVER ! EVER ! AGAIN ! Will we come back to this vet again. If you love your pets please do not bring them to this vet. The fact that Dr. Siegel and her entire staff were not wearing any masks during times like these with COVID-19 going around and also the fact that her office was completely empty on a Saturday morning Were ""red flags"" I should've known. Me and my two children brought our baby bird to Dr. Siegel for a check up and nail trimming. It was our first time there. Before she even checked our bird she asked about the food he was eating so I showed her a picture of the bag and she didn't Seem interested at all. She began to lecture and belittle me that I needed to put my bird on an organic food and she went on to say that if I don't check ingredients or check labels before buying food also how our water from a filtered fridge from home is not good for our birds, basically she was implying we were giving our bird garbage.she was very very unprofessional the whole visit , she was aggressive with our bird during the check up to where my son began to cry. She was also very unprofessional with the technician that was trimming our birds nails which by the way he had a red nail afterwards but of course she said it was OK. Our bird took a few bites at her and who can blame him. She put him back in the cage and then tried twice to get him out of the cage, it seem to me like she didn't get to complete his check up that was $84 later . When we were about to leave she proceeded to tell me that the masks that my children were wearing to protect them from the COVID-19 virus were more harmful than good.

"Saturday afternoon we were looking forward to a delectable steak dinner. We arrived at approximately 5:15 and were so happy to be seated right away, no waiting list today. As we reviewed all our choices we both decided to have the bone-in ribeye steak. Steak was accompanied by a salad that was very fresh but a bit on the skimpy side, I guess lettuce is on the expensive side right now so they're cutting down on the amount they're serving. We waited just a few minutes for our steak and were pleasantly surprised to see them come around the corner with our plates in hand. We anxiously cut into this beautiful cut of meat AND to our disappointment, it was tough just cutting into the steak. We couldn't wait to savor the bite....we bit down on a ""tough as shoe leather"" and very gristly piece of meat for $24.99.  I was totally disappointed, my husband was very upset because his steak was tough as well. Well, I reported this to the waitress and sent it back but my husband refused to send his back (not knowing what he would end up with). My replacement steak was a wee bit better but still tough!! Needless to say, we will not be returning and will not recommend it either.  So disappointed and disgusted to spend $25 on a horrific piece of meat.

The spicy salmon was on point, and the cucumber salad stuck out to me for a bit of crunch. I picked half greens half soba noodles and was very happy with my choice.

I literally had to take it out of my mouth because I could not swallow it. We ordered the chicken parm and veal parm for our entrees, figuring that these would be pretty tough to mess up. We were wrong. They both tasted like they had been in the freezer for weeks, and the gravy (sauce) tasted like Ragu. Needless to say, we will not be returning.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Cute place, parking is challenging, had to park on a side street & walk over. NBD. Placed a to go order for the vegan eggplant parm as per other Yelp reviews. Not excited... Smelled really good! Generous serving of the bread & pasta. Eggplant was VERY rubbery & chewy. To go order contained 2 large (mostly breaded) pieces if eggplant, had a hard time cutting it. The lady on the phone who took the order was SUPER nice & knew the to go order was for me when I walked in. Maybe I'll give it another go with another dish.

This is clearly a coffee shop that happens to sell loose leaf tea. What makes me say that? A number of things. First was storage. Tea stays fresh in air and light tight containers. All the tea is stored in glass containers. Most of them in the candy jars they must have bought in bulk.  I bought a few teas. One was a vanilla black that was so weak in taste that I tossed it out. The apricot black was a little better due to the fact that it actually tasted of apricot. The one tea I got that I liked was a rose green tea. And it was a tea that was at least stored in something air tight.  Zero questions. In the very least i should have been asked if i needed to buy a storage tin. Because the tea is put in is not resealable. No questions on how I brew at home or anything.  Zero instructions on brewing. I dont know if it because I just brought over four different teas at once and knew the ounce amount I wanted or if it was because I came in an hour before close. No instructions on the bags  I asked about the pu erh tea balls that said one ball for a pot.   Never going back.  Me: how big a pot?

"We LOVE the TTC  tamales. We buy them about once a week, and probably would buy them more often if we could afford to.  Reasons the 3-star rating is not a 5-star rating:   1) Mix-ups in our orders almost every time we call in our order. We would pick up the order only to discover when we got home that some item(s) were missing or items were included that we hadn't ordered. We finally resorted to bringing hard copy of a computer generated list itemizing our order, handing that to the cashier, and keeping a copy we could use to check our order before leaving the restaurant. They STILL messed up the order! Frustrating, especially that it happens repeatedly.  2) Determining whether what you have ordered is actually in the bag they hand you is made challenging by the fact that only some of the tamales have identifying stickers on them. Why not put a sticker on every tamale to cut out the guesswork, both for staff and customers?  3) The efficiency of TTC would be improved tremendously if, when they are very busy (which is often) they created 2 lines, one for people who need to order, and a 2nd for people who are just coming in to pick up an order they've already phoned in. It's frustrating to call in your order, go there (very hungry) to pick it up, and then have a long wait in a long line while people at the front of the line who may be visiting TTC for the first time go over the menu, item by item, with the order taker before deciding what they want and placing their order.  4) It might help to have an efficiency expert analyze the entire operation, especially the front counter, and make some suggestions about how its efficiency could be improved. The staff at times seems very stressed as they struggle to deal with competing demands of  phoned-in orders, eat-in orders, and catering orders.  Thank you, TTC, for the wonderful tamales. The inefficiency/chaos in the delivery of your wonderful food to these adoring fans is our only complaint. However, it does put a dent in our enthusiasm and we would love to see your operation become more smoothly functional.

"I always get the pancake combo w/ 3 blueberry pancakes, sausage, and scrambled eggs.  It's a decent value at around $10.  There's syrup in a serving pitcher on the table when you get there, but if you ask, they will bring you a container of real 100% natural maple syrup.  I recommend that.  Others I have breakfast with often get omelets which are HUGE and......I am told.....very good.  Coffee it decent....not great.....I don't understand why places that specialize in BREAKFAST can't get it right on the COFFEE.   This is not a problem unique to this place.  Service can be dicey, especially if they are really busy....which they are on weekend mornings.....every weekend.  But between the waitress and the busser they keep your drinks full.  Parking can be a challenge.  There are many on street spaces right in front of the place but they are almost always occupied.  However, there is a HUGE underground parking lot right across the street at Paseo Nuevo and you can always get a spot in there.  First 75 minutes are free.  So I recommend you do a drive-by on Chapala Street and if no spaces, you can hook it right into that garage.  I have lived in Santa Barbara since 1989 and have been coming to Esau's since at least 1993, starting at their old location on State Street and following them over to the new location.

"Fantastic Indian food! One of the best Indian restaurants I can name in Tampa.  Absolutely love coming here and have brought back friends and family as well.   Service: The staff here is wonderfully sweet and attentive to all of our needs while dining. Whether it's a take out order or dine-in, they make the entire process super easy.   Food: Oh gee. One of the best Indian restaurants I have been to thus far. Every dish I have tried has been exceptionally well-made and very fresh. Top faves:  Palak Paneer - creamy and delicious. This is one of my favorite dishes and Haveli has only made me love it even more. Their palak is definitely fresh and the paneer isn't rubbery at all. I like how it is creamy and not watery or oily. CANNOT GO WRONG.   Navratan Korma - made with cashews, this curry has become a new found love. The dish here is very flavorful and cooked in a rich cashew base. The vegetables in this korma are nicely cooked as well and not raw.   Garlic naan - So so good. Again super fresh and the perfect amount of garlic and butter. The naan is soft and melts in your mouth.   Extras: One thing I LOVE here is that fact that they place candled warmers under the dishes. This keeps the food from getting cold and makes the experience even better...nobody likes a cold, rubbery paneer (haha). Love their papad and chutney array - can't beat an Indian restaurant who has this staple  Overall, I absolutely love coming to Haveli and have been back (ahem) several times. I love North Indian dishes but they can be overwhelming at times...at Haveli the food is properly balanced, properly spiced, and wonderfully delicious.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I read so many good reviews about this place and my hubby is a real pizza lover--me, not so much. It's truly one of my least favorite foods. But Five Points won me over! The pizza was so flavorful and good. Not too doughy, not too saucy-- the perfect amount of everything!  We ordered a large 2 topping pizza half pepperoni and sausage (for me) and half double pepperoni (for my hubby). Okay, I don't know where to start. It was soo good, honestly! Remember, I'm not the biggest fan of pizza but the bottom of the crust was crisp and held up to the toppings, the sauce had depth of flavor and wasn't too sweet, the toppings were plentiful but not too much that they made the pizza too heavy when you picked it up. Definitely 5/5 for pizza! Now let's talk garlic knots-- if you don't get garlic knots WHAT ARE YOU EVEN DOING!? They really were some of the best I've head. Smothered in butter and pieces of fresh garlic and topped with basil, so yummy! I'm a true garlic lover so these spoke to my heart! Don't second guess yourself, matter of fact don't even think about it, JUST ORDER THE GARLIC KNOTS, and thank me when you take your first bite (you're welcome)!  Now let's talk about service.. the service was great from our hostess who was friendly and immediately sat us to our server who was knowledgeable and attentive. Service definitely 5/5.

"I'm totally in love with this place...everything about it! The space is gorgeous with high ceilings and an open kitchen. Stop #2 on our NOLA tour, my gf and I walked in and grabbed two seats at the bar where we could watch the kitchen staff work their magic.   Though I wasn't planning on ordering another cocktail after the strong drink at stop #1, I couldn't resist a whiskey drink called the Overly Aggressive Old Man. Not only does it have an awesome name, but it is a combination of all my favorite things- rye, cynar, campari, carpano antica. Could not have asked for anything better.  We went with the waitresses recommendations when it was time to order and I'm so glad we did. Everything came out looking beautiful and tasting fabulous. - Yellowfin tuna crudo- ($14) chunks of avocado and thin sliced fennel were tossed in a dressing, topped with chunks of fish, and salty pistachios. All the flavors and textures combined perfectly. - Raviolo- a single large ravioli stuffed with ricotta and served with a mushroom sauce. The flavors were delish and they brought us a few slices of bread to sop up the tasty sauce. For $11, I wish there would have been more than one. - Roasted carrots- these were amazing, served over a pea puree. So fresh and delish.  I desperately wanted to order another cocktail and more things off the menu, but since we had plans to make a few more stops, we called it quits.

"Really rough day. Was looking forward to a cold beer and a hot meal. Chuy's is close to home so headed there. After ordering a large beer the bartender told me about the specials. Any burger/ any beer for $9.99. Turns out the ""any beer"" is a small beer. Mine didn't qualify but he said I could always order another. Would have been nice to tell me about the special beforehand.  I ordered a burger meal, medium well. 35 minutes later, I was still waiting for my burger. Noticed a few other burger meals pass through the food window. I was asked a couple times if I wanted another beer. I responded that I was waiting for my meal before ordering another beer. After being asked the third time I said that I would much prefer my burger over the beer. After checking on my order the employee told me that since I ordered my burger well done, it would be a few more minutes. I immediately told her that I ordered it medium well, not well done, and asked to skip the meal and just pay for the beer as I was tired of waiting.   While she was ringing me up, I asked about a veteran's discount I overheard a few other customers get. She said they offer it, but since she already took off the mealI she could not discount my bill further. I believe the right thing to do would have been create a new ticket with a discounted drink, or comp the beer entirely for my extended wait. Doesn't matter, though as this is not my first negative experience at this restaurant so the easy choice is for me to not return as a customer. I keep thinking they will get better, but they don't and it is unfortunate because it really used to be a great restaurant to stop by to eat, drink, and hang out with friends.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I've been to this place twice.  The first time was great.  I went with a friend who knew the bartender.  We had excellent service, a good appetizer (homemade chips and dip) and the bar was packed.  It was a good experience.  The second time, however, was terrible.  I went with my boyfriend on a Saturday night in the summer, around dinner time.  We walk in and there is one person at the bar and two bartenders and they seem to be talking and having an ok time.  No one else in the whole place.  We sit down at the bar, order beers and look at the food menu.  The bartenders and the guy at the bar were complaining loudly about past bar guests the whole time we were sitting there, which struck me as very unprofessional.  I get it that they were probably miserable with a completely empty bar, but they were creating a super negative environment and it made us very uncomfortable.  We ordered food anyway, hoping that more people would show up.  I got a bbq pork belly grilled cheese, which turned out to be toasted bread, unmelted shredded orange cheddar and extremely overcooked and inedible thick cut bacon, all drenched in store bought bbq sauce.  My boyfriend got a fried chicken sandwich, which was drenched in an awful mayonnaise based sauce and also tasted terrible.  During this time, a woman came into the bar so the drunk (only) guy at the bar started harassing her.  At this point, we chugged our beers, got our tab and ran out the door, never to return again.  Oh, and the whole time we were there, the soundtrack was mostly Sublime songs, along with a smattering of other terrible 90's radio hits.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I should have went in with lower expectations. Between the wait and fish tacos - not impressed.  The FOOD: I get fish tacos pretty regularly and these were disappointing. Very little fish... mostly slaw- which if you choose the Caribbean slaw as your side - you basically are getting 2 flour tortillas filled with the same stuff!  Calamari (eh....) and conch fritters (ask for the remoulade or fish taco sauce instead of a what the red sauce they serve it with)   Husband's grouper was amazing! Should have gotten that. Kids were starving after a 1 hour wait so they left empty plates.   THE WAIT- HOST: not the friendliest. It's the first impression when you get to a restaurant, except for the exterior, and my 2 star experience started there. Also, not very prompt with turning tables once vacated.

"Such an awesome little place. Heard it was the oldest bar in Philly so I had to check it out & it did not disappoint. Great beer selection. Great music. And it's cheap. However, the bathrooms were in DISGUSTING shape. The floor was covered in piss.. Or dirty water maybe? Whatever it was it smelled and every inch of the floor was covered. Makes me wonder how bad it gets on a Friday or Saturday night when they're busy considering it was slow when I came in.   Came here solo & I met some cool people. Another downside is its in a little side alley and there were bums outside but that's not the bars fault and they didn't cause me any problems. Just be cautious and don't get wasted if you're not from around here. That's how you become a victim.

"My first impression of my anticipated trip to Lolita was bad..  My two friends and I walked right around the corner to the Wine and Spirit store (very close by - good to know), to buy Tequilla for Lolita.  When arriving to the restaurant, there was a table outside that seemed to be finishing up.  The weather was perfect, so my company and I agreed on outdoor dining, and the hostess said a couple of minutes.  We waited (which was very uncomfortable, because there is no where to wait) about 30 minutes, and when the table got up, the hostess was getting ready to seat another family at ""our"" table.  I let the hostess (and family) know that we were waiting for this table, so:    Our table was cozy    Margaritas were good, but.....$13 for the non-alcoholic margarita pitcher.    On the bottom of the menu, it literally tells you a minimum purchase is for each guest.  That's rude and uncalled for.   Our server (didn't catch her name) was extremely rude, not hospitable, and did not know the menu at all.   The food was okay.  I am not a fan of grilled lettuce (asparagus salad), but I know people like it, so I am not including this in my rating.

"On our way into Chipotle, my boyfriend and I smelled something incredible. It was a little snowy and I knew a more romantic lunch would be the perfect start to our afternoon together.   I was really excited by all of the combinations of ingredients and found a lot of flavor combinations I was interested in.   The food--The main reason people come out to eat should be for the taste of the food.   We ordered the Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza and the Gorgonzola Cheese and Pear. He and I both love garlic, but when I tell you it was garlicky--it was in the way that bites you back. It was so strong that I could still smell the garlic on his breath after eating, even though I ate some, too. The pear and gorgonzola pizza was a great combination of salty and sweet. The little spring mixed in a mayo dressing that tasted like straight up mayo could have been done without.   I didn't really love CPK's pizza's but I didn't not like them, either. Was lunch for two worth $50? Probably not. Was it worth the calories? Also, probably not.  I think this is one of those places where if you are habitual with what you eat, you might crave. Like other chain restaurants like TGIFridays, they push their sugary drinks.  There seemed to be a lot of added chemicals in the crust. We barely had a piece and a half each before we started feeling full. As soon as we got in the car, I took a nap on the way to the King of Prussia Mall... When I ate some left overs for breakfast the next day, I fell back asleep almost immediately.. I am not one who ever takes a nap so I actually do wonder why this happened both times after I ate their food.  On the service- Our waitress was friendly and outgoing.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Not really fast food and the lady that was taking the order at first did not look like she wanted to be there. She was mumbling the questions and I could barely understand her and kept asking for her to repeat her question. There were three other people who were also waiting for their orders for a very long time. When we all first went back up to the front counter, the cashier didn't even remember us and had already forgotten about our order. The manager stood behind them and just shook his head. By saying sorry for the inconvenience, they gave us two pies that were about to be tossed out anyways within the next 30 mins according to the time stamp. Otherwise, we come back here when we just want something fast and I'm too lazy to cook.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

They are friendly, laid back, and professional. The prices are on-point, with individual sessions or packages available. They also offer student and military discounts.   Most importantly, the beds and rooms are CLEAN.  The beds are a little bit older than I tend to see in other salons, and the stand up is a little bit smaller.  Still, the bulbs are always new and the acrylic is clean.    They're not open on Sundays for the summer, which is a bummer, but I like them enough that I've squeezed in a few weeknight sessions!

"Lunch combo 3 rolls for $9.99 and you get a soup or salad with it! I have a pretty big appetite but there are usually leftovers. I think 2 combos could probably feed 3 people a light meal.

This is a family owned business and the workers are friendly and nice. They'll really cater to your desires as best as they can. I have yet to try the Chinese food but their sushi is pretty good, especially for the low price.

The line tends to move pretty quickly though. Service is relatively quick, and I've never had an order get messed up, despite how busy they always are.  - The ""Hot"" spiciness level teared me up a little, and I'm usually the Asian asking for extra spicy sauce on the side of everything.

"I had never been to a Qdoba so I thought I'd try it.  What I discovered is that this is NOT a senior-friendly restaurant. I couldn't figure out the menu, and the staff was not willing to help. So I settled on 3 tacos.  What could go wrong?  The first thing I asked to be on them was rice and beans.  Guess what they left off?  You got it: rice and beans.  So all I got was the meat, lettuce, tomato and sauce. I couldn't figure out what was included and what was extra; the signage was very confusing and misleading. It seemed like EVERYTHING was extra, on top of the $10 price tag for 3 measly tacos. The quality was good, but it wasn't very filling since they left out half my order. If you're a senior, I would suggest using the app. That way you don't have to deal with the surly servers, you can see everything that's available and whether they're going to charge you extra for it. And best of all, you can take your order back if they leave things off like they did to me.  I guess this is a 'millennial' restaurant and they don't like geezers in there.

"I've been coming to AMC Marlton for years now and can say that this AMC location is a perfect place to watch your favorite movies. Since it's renovations years ago, AMC Marlton has gone from a nobody to a contender when it comes to the movie-going experience.  On its exterior, this theatre may seem outdated and old, but it isn't until you enter a theatre itself do you notice that this place is something special. While it may not offer IMAX, it does offer Dolby Digital, which in my opinion creates a better experience. Each theatre in this building is equipped with AMC's signature reclining seats, so you know that you can literally sit back and relax when viewing a film. An added bonus is that this location is a quick 5 minute drive from my house, which make it so convenient! With that said, whether your commute is 5 minutes or 50 minutes, coming to AMC Marlton is worth it.  (Dune was also great and can't wait for part 2!!

It's a brand new space which only makes me question standards elsewhere.   The food has been great generally but I am celiac - I asked for a roll to be made without tempura and watched them make it with- usually no big deal- but my request to remake it was not warmly received.

They would not provide separate checks; only split the check in two. Well, that has not changed. It is still their policy and it is outrageous. This is why none of our dining friends will go there. We thought we would give it another chance. What can I say? The food was excellent and the service was good but this is our last visit. On another note, we had a restaurant.com certificate that they would not honor. The 'chef?' said they are not part of that program even though restaurant.com says they are.

Did not have a crispiness to it The Crust is overly large and extremely bland. Normally Crust is the finisher for the pizza so when you bite through all the toppings and sauce and eventually get to the crust you should be having an orgasm. Instead, it was not great. It's sorta boring and just bleh.  Place could do better.  It's local So that is why it gets  better rating than normal and the pizza itself wasn't half bad. Prices are little too high.

"This was my stomping grounds until recently. I kind of had a 2nd life on South St (past the old high school days) just bustin it up with my people at the hat store across the street. A recurring theme of this list is that these places... for me personally... were hidden in plain sight. When I looked them up I wondered each time, why haven't I been there before?  So what's the deal with Venus? The shop looks dated, but they have something you want... maybe? On this side you have watches and pretty much everywhere else you have scents... women's on that side and guys on the other side. I wasn't wowed by the selection but it's nothing to sneeze at. This guy has a some classics, some originals (before reformulation), and some current offerings you'd find at the mall. To each his own, who knows what you might find here? Straight off the gate, he has my 2 current go to scents I've been wearing for years... before I decided to get back into the fragrance game. You have my attention right there. I think Venus has mostly designer stuff with some classics sprinkled in (Kourous, Fahrenheit, Lapidus, Rive Gauche, ...that sort of thing). The owner said that he could make special orders through his connects depending on what you're looking for.  They allow testing if a bottle is open already and I think they even do decants if they have enough bottles in stock. I haven't taken advantage of that, but it's very cool. I'd have to go back and really see what's available for decant.   PRO-TIP: A decant is a smaller side bottle (bigger than a sample) siphoned off the original for a fraction of the price.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 3.0

"F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S Spa facility! I now have experienced the ""lap of luxury"".... And I want to crawl back into that lap as soon as I can. I will admit that my 'spa' experience is somewhat limited, but I have enough massages and pedi's under my belt that I believe I could be considered somewhat of a subject matter expert.  The facility was immaculate and soooo peaceful, the kind of place you actually imagine when you imagine a really luxurious spa.  The staff was so helpful, and won't even point out that there is a stack of towels 10 feet from where you were when you asked for towels (I blame this on massage brain...you know...so relaxed that you can't remember your own name), they will kindly just bring them to you.   There is a private pool area attached to the spa that you have access to for entire time the spa is open.  The most glorious part of this is that there are no children, no screaming, and no crying...just some very relaxed adults sipping drinks (I had sparkling wine), soaking in the sun, and relaxing. Though, I believe they had massage brain too.   I could probably write another 10 paragraphs on it, but you really must experience it yourself.  It is pricey, but definitely worth it.  My friend said the 80 minute hot-stone massage she got was the best massage she has ever had and is already planning to go back after the holidays.     The hotel was picturesque and the staff professional, helpful, and respectful. I hope to return at some point in the future for a mini-staycation that definitely includes a spa visit.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 5.0

"I've lived in Tucson on my own for about 4 years now.  I still don't know of any other single place that sells my detergent, my swiffer bundles, and my paper towels at decent prices.  So I come here for these things but usually walk out with more.  I bought a big green plastic bowl from the dollar area.  It's like a dollar store, but unlike the dollar store, they only have things one would need.  Like a heart shaped silicone baking tray, or a small tin box with Transformers printed all over it.  They also sometimes have dumbbells, scrubby cleany bristley things, and giant plastic green bowls.  I was not planning on buying it, but I did kind of need a big green bowl.  I eat everything out of this bowl: spaghetti, cereal, pizza, orange chicken, ribs.  The dollar store at Target is better than the dollar store at the dollar store because at the dollar store at the dollar store, each item costs 100% of every other item.  So each purchase is a huge decision.  But the items at the dollar store at Target leave such a small dent on the total bill that you can just wantonly throw things into your cart from these small aisles and whomever is paying for the purchase won't even notice, and if they do notice after the fact, they won't care because it was only a dollar.  Alas, Target is still a Target.  It has the same under enthused employees that act nice but don't really know too much about their products.  This Target has a Starbucks.  I don't consider it a department store but all the other Targets are labeled as such so I won't disagree.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 3.0
"The first day I moved to Tucson, I had Jimmy's deliver a pizza to my apartment next door because we were too tired from moving into a third-story apartment. This was back in March and I have been a frequent customer ever since.  Everything I've had there has been great. The pizza is always on-point, the lasagna is great, I'm even eating one of the garlic knots while I'm writing this. And delivery is always quick. I've been inside a couple times too and the full bar is excellent when dining in.

I was excited to try Adama because sometimes I just feel better about myself for eating healthy.   I thought that if I liked this place I would be a regular and it would make up for so many other things.    Unfortunately this will not be the case.    The food was ugly.   Not pretty on the plate.   My friend had a sandwich and it was bland.   Worst of all the server was not a pleasant person at all.   We felt like being there was a burden to her.     It wasn't cheap either!   Actually for the flavor I thought it was pretty expensive.   Kind of the price of Ahi tuna or a good steak for food that doesn't have a single ingredient over $2.99 a pound.   (OK I am sure there was some weird ingredient that cost more than that but you get the point)   Probably not going back.  Boo!,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Plato meaning dish or plate in Spanish. The name of the restaurant is perfectly named. The Latino Dish. It identified the the cuisine immediately if you know the meaning of the restaurant.   This small restaurant get a lot of attention during lunch time. We were there 11:40am. The crowds start coming at 12:00 noon on weekdays. We have order the bistec and the pepper steak. The bistec is grilled steak with two choices of side. Since we have two dishes, we got the yellow rice, white rice and sweet plantain. The steak is a bit tough but is is good grilled steak. The pepper steak is cut into pieces and flat iron plate grilled.   We like the devil crab which is not smell too fishy. It has full crab meat inside.

"Pleasant outdoor seating on a nice day to enjoy some craft beer and food. Picnic table style seating outside. Inside the restaurant, there is a pool table near the bar area. The nachos and wings were really tasty. The reason this place loses a start is because they aren't really accommodating to small children. The hostess told us that there are only 2 tables that allow high chairs and when we arrived they were both taken (by people with no children). We figured we would let the two toddlers sit in the double stroller while we ate but then we were told that we couldn't have a stroller either. So if you have small children, you might want to find another place that is more accommodating. If you're going with a group of friends, I would recommend this place.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 3.0

"I remember when this place first opened up, there was a lot of speculation as to whether or not it would live up to its Tampa equivalent. I have now been to the St Pete one more and I still not sure that it does. On the plus side, the calamari is some of the best I've had in town. It's always been served fresh and is incredibly tender. I usually have fish dishes or salads, the chicken ginger salad and mahi burger are my favorite. A few things that could use some improvement starts with service. It is always a hit or miss. I look forward only to late night hookahs where I require little skill or knowledge from the waitstaff. Sometimes the staff can be very inattentive and all the times that I have asked for descriptions of their wines or deserts, I get either someone that reads me back the menu or guesses. A wine tasting would certainly benefit this restaurant crew. Another thing is the fruit platter that for 10 bucks is a great value of a large amount of grapes, pineapple, honey dew, cantaloupe, and watermelon. This is a great starter for up to four or five people even and also when sharing a hookah. Unfortunately, along with two crackers, they serve it paired with only a large scoop of cream cheese and a fruit dipping sauce. The dipping sauce is not bad but the cheese definitely needs some reconsideration. Some slices of a creamy brie and goat cheese would be a far better pairing, especially for the price. I also want to note that I don't buy anything from the bar here. It's quite pricey and from what I can tell the drinks are not a standard pour. The martini I bought was incredibly sweet like it was half grenadine and even the two for one sangria tasted like fruit juice and was not worth the money. I love that this place is open late even on weekdays and is the best value and atmosphere for a hookah. I keep my fingers crossed for the rest. I would love to see a tighter more knowledgeable staff and a revised fruit plate for start.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Initially I really liked these guys. I purchased a used spa, they moved it and provided tons of advice for what to look for. I try to support local businesses and despite being able to purchase chemicals, filters and other items less expensively on the internet I purchased from TMSD.  Where things went sour was my tub required a new control panel. I purchased one from TMSD. They required me to pay $650.00 in full before they ordered it which was fine they ordered the wrong one! I immediately returned it, along with 4 filters I purchased from them that were not needed because the tub had washable filters. They found another control panel that was used for $300.00, also great and I was still happy with them. That was September.... I kept looking for the refund for the difference. It didn't come. I called and left messages. I emailed. No response so I left more messages, and still nothing. Finally I spoke to Dennis in December!! He said he was waiting for his refund in order to refund me! He also said he didn't have time to keep calling about it because he was so busy handling all the orders from the pandemic!  I told this was poor customer service and not what I wanted to hear. He's too busy making money to service a clients issue!  Despite more messages he has never responded.  Now I am stuck chasing after this dead beat for $350. At this point it's not the amount it's the principal. I loathe the idea of wasting more time taking him to small claims court since it wastes more of my time. He has lost the servicing of this tub, and the inevitable purchase of a new tub when this one expires. Potential customers should carefully evaluate where their purchase is made, your tub will require service.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 1.0

"I don't know what has happened recently but the service and overall experience at this Red Robin seem to have gone downhill.  We waited at the front for almost 10 minutes before the bartender finally noticed us and went to grab the hostess... who was loafing around with the other servers and cooks just around the corner.  The booth we sat in had a greasy tabletop and moldy, crumbly food smashed in between the booth wall and the seats.  The bathrooms were also nasty and looked like they had been trashed-and-dashed instead of actually cleaned.  The lobby/entry area also had a musty stink that stayed with us throughout our visit.  Not only have the prices gone up, but the size of the burgers has gone down.  One of our orders was also wrong, and it took several minutes just to flag down our server to correct the mistake.  No wonder this place was so empty during the lunch hour.  This is very disappointing as we have been Red Robin fans for a very long time and the ParkCenter location has been our favorite spot out of the three in town.

I dealt with three different reception staff and they were all rude, which is common attitude I've experienced in here (dunno what southern hospitality people are talking about, the ones who have been nice have had big eyes for tips. I am blaming it on the heat). However, the two bag-boys were pretty hospitable, again of course for tips. I stayed in the petit room, which is really-really small as expected but it's amazing what they've done with such a small space - very modern interiors. Very dimly lit corridors so for those who believe in it - the place feels a bit spooky especially at the back of the hotel. I heard a lady scream and a door slam in the middle of the night. And I heard a story of a woman who apparently ran downstairs crying, a few days earlier. Anyway, and there is also no elevator either.

Well, I happen to check my bank account today (Feb 24) and find that they charged me for the stay- no confirmation email, nothing.

Confused, I hung up and went back and double checked my bank account... yup, Hyatt Regency at Penn's Landing, Philadelphia, PA. I called them back and explained my situation, they found my reservation in the system but it was dated for Feb 20.   So basically, this hotel: 1.) Charged me when I was told I wouldn't be charged until my actual stay. 2.) Charged me with no confirmation email. 3.) Denied that they charged me when I called them. 4.) Entered my reservation in on the wrong date.   They said they will refund me but it shouldn't have happened in the first place. AND this has caused me some financial inconveniences.

I turned around and asked that same checker who was now in a huddle with all of the other 4 talking and another gal said yes 12B.  I walked down the aisle searching and all 5 of them continued their conversation.  I was furious now that what I had come to expect at a small store was customer service and there was NONE!

"I live across the street and have treated this place as my go-to for a quick Guinness (properly poured) after work and watching a quarter of the Sixers game, and for the easy brunch on a weekend with my girlfriend.  First and foremost, the food is awesome.  This is notable because it really does not need to be awesome, but they obviously care about putting a great menu together with some quality cooking.  Lamb tacos, chicken tenders, and nachos are all FAR above average for bar food in the city.  The brunch is also great and features the best full Irish breakfast in Philly.  A rare find.  The only downside is random and I worry it is petty, but it cannot be ignored.  The owner obviously loves music, and he has great taste, but the music is far too loud in there.  I treat St. Stephen's as my neighborhood haven, an identity which the bar tries to embrace with its fireplace and friendly staff.  However, it is sometimes even louder than a Center City bar in there, and for no reason whatsoever.  I am not an old man telling kids to get off my lawn, and all my friends and neighbors who frequent St. Stephen's agree with the volume issue.  When the music is off for the preference of the sports broadcast, the TV is also deafeningly loud.  Just a confusing trait of the place.  Besides that, I could not have asked to live across the street from a better pub.

"Cantina, you're going to suffer from the opening of Loco Pez.  The taco fillings are so tasty I didn't even need to use a drop of hot sauce, although there were several bottles of what looked like homemade sauces of different kinds. I always find myself dumping all the different hot sauces I can find on the Cantina $1 tacos to get some flavor. The tacos at Loco Pez may be small in diameter, but damn do they stuff them! You're going to end up with a whole taco of filling in the basket when you finish one. They could really make 2 tacos out of each.  Today I tried camarones - surprisingly breaded and fried, but to absolute perfection! Those are some high quality shrimp! I also had seitan with spinach - holy crap, they actually know how to prepare seitan. It actually had taste and texture! My last was al pastor, no less delicious or overstuffed than the other two. I can't believe how cheap these are!  We shared a plate of nachos, which were just OK. Not a whole lot of cheese on them. I probably won't get them again, if only to be able to eat more TACOS! I also had the margarita with chipotle, I forget what they called it though, maybe Monte Carlo? It was definitely a spicy, unique drink. Spicy beverage + spicy dishes are not enough contrast, so next time I'll stick with a sweet one.  The layout of the place is a little awkward, but if you want to eat and it's crowded at the entrance by people waiting for a drink at the bar, make sure you just get through the bar crowd to the hostess at the back.  It's a good thing they don't take cards, just cash, or I would have spent a LOT more money on trying all the different margaritas.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Back again, this time with family and much more limited than my first all-star experience at Buddakan. My family and I enjoyed a wonderful New Years Day dinner here and had a great time. My dad was looking to impress his girlfriend with a little more flashy dining choice and because we had been to Morimoto the last time he was in town, felt it was my duty to help him minimize the hurt on his wallet while still showing the lady a good time.   The space is exactly as I remembered it, very chic decor with lighting that eludes quite the sensual atmosphere of high class dining. I sat here amazed this time at the thought of how harsh the restaurant must look with it's sharp lines when all of the lights are on in the restaurant, it really is a wonder what the right lighting can do. We sat right between the big Buddha and the waterfall wall, so we had the best of all worlds as well as a very attentive waitress who took exceptional care of us.   My brother and I started our meal with the delicious kobe beef skewers with tempura. The tempura was nothing to write home about, but the beef was phenomenal. I urged my father's girlfriend to try the edamame ravioli, I told her that she would thank me later for that...which of course she did. And my father started us with an order of the cold thai noodles, a refreshing blend of noodles, and the sweet and spicy of tropical papaya and jalape√±o. Dinners around the table were all seafood choices of which I demanded a taste of all. My father's Chilean sea bass was nicely cooked, his girlfriend's sesame tuna was alright considering that she did not order it rare, my brother's scallops were nice sitting atop a spicy sauce with tofu, and my miso black cod was perfectly cooked with a sweet unagi sauce.   Dessert here was the real forte though, there were orders of homemade cherry sorbets, an order of crying chocolate with a spectacular vietnamese coffee ice cream. My dad prides himself on his ability to turn out this sweet creamy coffee at home, but if he could turn it into an ice cream like this, he'd forever be my culinary idol. My order of a milk chocolate and caramel tart practically brought tears to my eyes.  A silky mousse over gooey caramel with a cookie tart crust and carmelized bananas? Everything I love on one beautifully plated dish.  One of the major kudos I give to this Starr location is the execution and plating of every single dish that comes from the kitchen.

This place is unbelievable. Been in there a few times. Just moved to this side of town. Two days ago I buzz the door to get in and some black lady met me at the door with her attitude demanding my ID. Told me I had to let her see my ID else she would not let me in. I told her I had s Dotty's players club card. She with her attitude demanding my ID. So I showed it to her. Cashed in some change for a dollar. Played and lost. Not once was I offered something to drink. But I had to listen to her and her friend talk about her boyfriend the whole time. Thought about spending more but decided against it because of her attitude. Next day decided to back in there but got a message on my phone. Same lady moves up front and watched me while I was in the parking lot chatting with someone. Today I buzz the door I am let in. I choose aachine to play I see the same lady peaking around a door frame in the back like a couple crack head. Then I sit down she comes out questions about what I was doing the night before. Said I was acting suspecious. Said I could not talk on my phone out in the parking lot. I told her suspecious is not a crime and she can not tell me what to do. She said yes she could and she can have me thrown out. I informed her she hasn't rights to tell me what to do and get out. I left and I told her I would be contacting corporate today. All the other staff are really nice. Now I see why it is dead in there when she is working.,Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 1.0
"We went here while visiting Nashville from CA ... on Cinco de Mayo. It was busy but the service was still stellar. And the food was great. Of the group, the faves were the Cauliflower taco, the Al Pastor taco, the Enchiladas and man - those chips, salsa and queso - yum!  I would say, however, the guacamole is not really guacamole. It is essentially smashed avocado lacking all the true ingredients and flavors of guacamole. Would suggest passing on that item. We were also celebrating a birthday and the churros did not disappoint - light and delicious. What a great find!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"This review is more about a particular sandwich and new service. Everyone knows this is one of, if not the best poboy restaurants in the city. So much so that it never occurred to me to review it. All that information is old news and I assume everyone knows.   Now on the the sandwich. I have for the first time tried their Halloween specialty the Edgar Allan Poe-boy. Absolutely delicious. I don't know the last time I had alligator sausage, but it certainly wasn't on a poboy covered in gravy and debris. Aside from how good it was it also has Morgus the Magnificent associated and that just makes me happy. I have fond memories of rewatching VHS recordings during the spooky time of year. My stepdad and uncle even recorded their own spoof of Morgus on VHS so there's a knock off out there somewhere.   And on to the service I mentioned. They now have a call in window for you to call ahead, skip the line, and speed home with your food. This is great for locals who want a poboy fix for dinner, but don't want to fight the crowds after a long days work. Now just counting the days till I can get my hands on a thanksgiving poboy.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"If you're looking for great diner style fare and breakfast in Clearwater then look no further. McCabe's is a great little spot with good prices, good service, great breakfast and excellent ownership.   For me the main judgement of a good diner is the quality of their coffee, and theirs is wonderful. You will never be waiting on another cup either as someone will be by every few minutes to keep your cup full.   My husband also needed breakfast catering for a client recently and McCabe's gave him a great price for catering and delivered at no extra charge. He was very pleased.  Brian McCabe is a true irishman and you will likely meet him when he stops by your table to fill up your coffee. He takes pride in his diner and greets every customer with a smile and if you're lucky a joke or two.

Theres a bike shop close to Big Lake where you can rent tandem bikes by the hour. There's also a boat shop at the same location to rent a boat to paddle out on the lake. They close around 7, and let you return the bike as late as 730. The sculpture garden was what I wanted to see the most, but only got to see around the outside fence since they close at 6.

1.5 stars. I started off with the miso soup and I've def had better at other sushi places. It had an odd unknown flavor. The rolls were fine but nothing special. The service I didn't care for.

"Came here for brunch with a group of friends, and it really was one my favorites in New Orleans. Everything we had was excellent, and delivered a unique twist on a standard morning meal.   First, the building is beautiful, and the space is just really cool. We sat outside as its starting to get nicer, and the wait staff was incredibly attentive and present. The meal started with a herbed bread and a sweet butter, which I had never had before, but I could not stop eating. The savory and sweet went perfectly in the low key complimentary bread.   We each also had coffees, which the waitstaff ensured we never empty, while waiting for our breakfast appetizer of sweet buns. These were more pecan buns or sticky rolls than cinnamon buns, but no one has ever been upset about any of those options.   Then, the eggs benedict feature a creole pork, really adding to the meal for someone who will get eggs benedict whenever they see it on the menu. The jambalaya omelet lived up to its name, but was excellent on both ends of the combination. The rice, shrimp, and andouille were all delicious, and stuffed into an omelet they made for an excellent New Orleans brunch dish.  My girlfriend had ordered the sweet cakes, and it was without a doubt my favorite item anyone got. It was lathered in bourbon syrup, and accompanied by fried bananas, giving it just enough fruit that I could pretend it was healthy. The sweetness was a great combination of thick syrup, with a sweet cake base that would have been sweet on its own. However, it never felt like too much and even though I am a savory brunch kind of guy, I have been craving this since we left.  Overall we had an excellent time, and I look forward to going back for brunch soon, and cannot wait to try it for dinner.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"What really is the purpose of Yelp?   Is it to merely offer up casual reviews and star ratings of area businesses? Or is there more at stake.  I think there's more. For me, Yelp works best when those who review approach it from a perspective of wanting to help both customers and business owners have the best experience possible and when businesses take that feedback offered and improve their products and customer service.   When Yelp is working at its best, it's a win-win situation for both the customer and the business.   While I've certainly written intensely negative reviews, I pride myself on creating reviews that are well written, critically valuable, and offer honest, legitimate feedback regarding my own experiences as a customer and as a customer with a disability.   When I first visited the new Shapiro's Twisted Traditions at Keystone at the Crossing, I recall leaving the restaurant with jumbled emotions having truly enjoyed my meal yet having also been frustrated by what felt like confusing customer service and a physical layout that was not particularly wheelchair friendly.   A few days ago, Sally Shapiro, part of the Shapiro family and a member of the Indianapolis-based mini-chain's management team, contacted me after they'd reviewed my comments regarding accessibility and they'd had the opportunity to make some modest changes meant to address what they had deemed to be legitimate issues.   First off I was impressed with the contact and I was even more impressed that they'd already put an action plan in place. She asked if I'd be willing to meet her at the restaurant to try it all out.   Of course!  So, tonight after work I ventured over to Keystone at the Crossing to check out their adjustments in what is actually a rather challenging space.   Wow. Brilliant. With minor tweaking, Shapiro's was able to take what would have been an obstacle course for a wheelchair, especially when the restaurant is crowded, and turn it into an easily flowing restaurant that offers easy access to individuals of varying mobilities. The changes made were incredibly minor, yet for someone in a wheelchair they will mean the difference between having easy access and being able to operate more independently without fear of repeatedly running into people.   It was incredibly impressive and I served up my wholehearted praise for their efforts.   Now then, out of a sense of fair disclosure, I will also serve notice that I unexpectedly received a meal this evening to go with my willingness to drive up North and offer feedback regarding accessibility issues. I dined on the meatloaf, a potato cake, buttered noodles, and wheat bread. It was an abundant meal that was absolutely delicious. I also drank my usual iced tea. While they have many desserts, I couldn't have possibly considered it by meal's end.   As an added bonus, Ms. Shapiro joined me as I dined and we had a wonderful opportunity to talk about the history of Shapiro's, Yelp, Brittany of Yelp, and life in general. It was a warm, hospitable experience and one I treasured.   The staff continues to be warm and friendly, while the restaurant's early struggles with technology are working themselves out and the early notes of confusion seem to have largely dissipated. While my first meal was marked by accessibility concerns and various amounts of stress, this meal was relaxed, enjoyable, and marked by quality food, quality customer service, and stunningly improved access.   For those of you who care about disability access, I hope you'll give these folks a chance. Lots of businesses will serve up lip service about making changes, but Shapiro's really followed through beautifully. So, yes, while this might not quite be a ""fine dining"" 5-star experience, Shapiro's gets a 5-star rating for proving that it cares about ALL of its customers and for the quality of its food and employees.   See? When Yelp works the way it's supposed to everybody wins!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Happy to have tried it! My husband and I wanted to try something new today , I'm glad we did. Both enjoyed the food and service. We shared the seafood ceviche, which was a great fusion of Latin and Asian flavors, but be prepared to sweat it was pretty spicy but totally worth it! We then had the Big Daddy roll and the volcano roll. Both really good. I like how different restaurants put their own touch on creating rolls, in this case the volcano roll. Big daddy was also really good but I've had comparable rolls elsewhere that were fresher. Will come back, great selection",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Alright, so here goes...wonderful and warm welcome by staff, excellent pepper jack boudin balls; however, the color. taste and texture in the balls are quite different from what I'm used to.  Legnon's in New Iberia is the gold standard to me.  The color here is more red, the taste could use more creole seasoning, the texture was more mushy.  With that, it wasn't the worst either.  There's a surprising amount of meats and even more healthier Cajun options like: cauliflower boudin and chicken cracklings (I'm so serious). My husband was like, ""Chicken Cracklings...WTH?"" Lol, I actually liked them. Not a big fan of their smoked boudin but the regular boudin was good, some undercooked rice in it but nicely seasoned with a little kick of spice.  I bought the precooked frozen jambalaya in a bag.  You'd just sit the bag in boiling water and voila, it's ready! I love the smoked color on their ham hocks and will definitely be getting them.  They were out of crawfish boudin and pork cracklings but overall, it's a very nice place to get your Cajun and smoked meats from.  Very neat and clean, been there since October 2017.

Not the best steak I've had, but certainly very good. The service was good, even though it was from a bunch of old weird dudes in tuxes.  The atmosphere was comical.  It's a time warp back about 50 years.  The restaurant was practically empty.  The clientele was a little bizarre, but entertaining.    Everyone was dressed up.  We had on collard shirts and jeans, but the still let us in.  I'm guessing it's because they can't really turn away any business when the restaurant is empty.

The negatives they pick and choose who they will offer wine. I received a pedicure and SNS dip on my hands. I thought I deserved a glass of wine with the amount I paid but unfortunately I was only offered water. My feet were painted average. The tech barely massaged my feet or scrubbed my feet. In regards to the SNS she took her time but unfortunately my nails are all different lengths. I pointed it out and the tech stated it's impossible to match.

"By the gods, this place was terrible! I've been putting this review off because I've been rather busy lately. But now it's time to get down to the nitty gritty.  The customer service wasn't that great. They had the whole ""hurry up and order something""mentality. They Just basically show little or no concern for their customers. So I wasn't very impressed with customer service at this seafood restaurant.  Now onto the food, I have actually eaten at this restaurant once before. The first time I had food here was during mardi gras. Me and my friend Ronald stopped here and got some crawfish. I liked the crawfish the first time I went here, but my friend Ronald said he didn't like it because it was too spicy. The second time I got the food was when I went here with my girlfriend Nikki. Given my first experience I figured that she would like this place because they serve really spicy crawfish. I ordered a couple of pounds of crawfish and some shrimp fried rice then we left. When we went back to my place her and I were digging in. The shrimp fried rice was nothing to brag about. The crawfish was good at first but as we had almost eaten three quarters of the crawfish she made a discovery. A big nasty looking bug mixed in with the crawfish, Gross!!!!! We made haste back to the restaurant, when we let them know what happened. They didn't even act like they were shocked, The way they acted it seems like it's a common occurrence. To add insult to injury instead of giving us a full refund they only gave us a partial refund because we had eaten some of the crawfish. A big thanks for absolutely nothing to them for that one! Another thing that shocked me was the fact that all the other customers heard us telling them about the bug in the crawfish but seemed completely unfazed. Seriously WTF is wrong with them?  The restaurant itself is small, it's pretty much a deli with inside and outside seating. The crawfish is more expensive here than it is on the Westbank which is typical of seafood places in this area. Other than that it's a hole in the wall place.  In short unsanitary food, poor customer service, and overpriced. In other words this place is good for nothing!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Came here with co-workers for lunch. We ordered full portions of the black bean chicken, kung pao chicken, and three cup chicken. The black bean and kung pao were good.

It's a simple dish yet I think they tried to improve on it and made it worse. It had a strong taste of cooking wine, which maybe some people like but since I was expecting something else I wasn't very happy with it.   Otherwise, everything else was good. Full size portions were definitely filling, and we did family-style and shared our dishes. (They also have lunch size portions at 60% of the full portion for 60% of the price.) Service was good.

"I always hate that Yelp doesn't have half star options.  Little Gem definitely doesn't deserve 4 stars based on their food but I didn't want to give them 3 stars because the doctor that owns the restaurant is a nice guy and I appreciate what he has done to the building and the idea behind the restaurant.  I have been to Little Gem twice.  The first time was right after it opened for a ticketed event to see Kermit Ruffins.  The place was very crowded and my friend and I were some of the only ones who didn't have a seat.  I think I just had a few drinks and enjoyed the atmosphere and the concert.  I would definitely return for another event like this but I would make sure to book early and reserve a table beforehand.  I went for the second time yesterday for lunch with my father.  We were there at noon on the day of the Sugar Bowl.  Downtown was pretty busy with OU and Alabama fans but the restaurant wasn't too busy.  The host let us pick our table which was nice.  The waiters who took care of us were very nice and attentive.  The only problem came with the lunch.  My father and I both ordered the Louisiana Blue Crab Cake from the ""Large Plates"" section of the menu.  I didn't pay attention that Crab Cake was in the singular because I never imagined that the ""Large Plate"" would only contain one crab cake the size of a large half dollar.  The rest of the items on the ""large plate"" were mostly inedible.  The fried green tomatoes, Caper-Celeriac Gribiche and the Succotash Salad were left mostly untouched on both of our plates.  In fact, it wasn't until looking over the menu to write this review that I realized that what I thought were two fried hunks of onion deceptively placed next the the singular crab cake were actually the fried green tomatoes.  The crab cake was ok for a bite and a half...  I will point out that the cost of that ""large plate"" was only $13 so it wasn't too horrible a value, but I think most diners would have been much happier with more crab cake and less crap to make a plate look full.  That said, I know many people like the food at this restaurant and my father likes the oysters.

"I bit into my veggie summer roll and there was a dead bug, built into it. Upon looking further, I noticed the bugs legs at a separate spot. I was utterly disgusted but I knew it wasn't the waitresses fault. When I handed it back I showed her what I saw but the only thing she did for me was bring me a new plate of them, which of course I was unable to eat. Since I was so grossed out, I looked further and noticed that the cabbage in my pho soup was dirty and the fork I was given looked like it had not been cleaned properly. I didn't say anything about the cabbage or fork, as I'm not super confrontational, however I was disappointed to see that they still charged me full price for everything, even though I literally found a dead bug in my food. Very unprofessional in my opinion. I usually have very good experiences with this restaurant but this made me never want to go back again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Full disclosure: I've lived in Nashville for three years and managed to avoid Broadways THE WHOLE TIME. It was an amazing streak, and I was sad to see it end. But for most people that live in Nashville (at least that I know), Broadway is definitely considered a place for tourists to drink and party and that we have to go to only when people are visiting. That's what happened to me. People in town that wanted to go to Broadway. I liked these people enough to end my streak. So that being said, Broadway is NOT my scene. Every bar is crowded and too loud for my old lady ears and is just full of bachelor and bachelorette parties and LOTS of tourists.   Luke's is definitely all the things I don't like about Broadway: too crowded (Friday night), too loud, expensive but blah well drinks and your regular beer selections, etc. Something I did think stood out about Luke's on a Friday night was that they weren't playing country music really late night Friday or early morning Saturday (I think we left around 2 am) - definitely more pop, hip hop, older hits. It was a nice break from the country music (since I'm not the biggest country music fan). The bar's layout was super confusing. We were trying to make our way to the upstairs rooftop (it's easy to find the lower one but that's way more crowded), but it was confusing. First, we found a staircase that supposedly led to a VIP area but it wasn't roped off or anything so we went up (small bar, some leather couches, a higher up view of the main area of the bar), but we couldn't get to the upper rooftop from there (other people had the same issue, bartenders were explaining that you had back downstairs and then up a different staircase). We finally got up there, and it was the best part of the bar for this girl that prefers chill bars to the Broadway scene. They had a live band playing 90s hits and a big open rooftop bar that wasn't that crowded. Maybe it's a good thing that the bar is laid out so confusingly - keeps that upper rooftop bar nice and NOT CROWDED. I think Luke's is connected to at least one other bar (I'm pretty sure we walked in through Jason Aldean's).   Broadway isn't my thing. But being at Luke's wasn't torture or anything. Not planning on going back anytime soon however. Save the space on Broadway for the tourists - that's my policy.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 3.0

"I hate leaving negative reviews but after the experience we had at this hotel, I had to warn others to steer clear. I have had no previous experience in Cherry Hill, NJ before staying here. Meaning I assumed from the photos that it was a nice place. Oh, how wrong I was to assume. My husband and I wanted to celebrate our wedding anniversary in their pagoda themed room for a night away from our kids. The pictures for the room looked so nice and even our photos from this room turned out great. However, the photos didn't show the worn out headboard, dingy bathroom, worn-out bed duvet, and horrible cigarette stench. I was aware that this place had a different manager who used to allow smoking in all the rooms, but heard it was no longer allowed to smoke in the rooms. They even took a $100 deposit when we arrived that we had to wait till 7 am to get back to ensure we wouldn't smoke inside the rooms. Unfortunately, It still reeked as if someone was just in there chain-smoking away.  Granted it was otherwise clean and the Jacuzzi tub worked perfectly. They also had a plethora of adult channels on the tv and free continental breakfast. I wish those few pros made this trip worth it but the entire night the room above us had four people inside, coming in and out to smoke, and running their tub all night long. There wasn't a single quiet moment after 8 pm. We tried to make the best of it until we woke up to leave. Only to discover our passenger side back window had been smashed in and most of our belongings in the cup holder and back seat stolen.  When speaking to the manager after they called a while after we had left, it was someone on a bike off the street that probably targeted our car for being at the end of the parking lot. They did not offer to pay for the damage or try to discount what we paid. Not that we would ever go back, but it would have been nice of them to try to rectify this crappy stay.  All in all, do not take a chance and stay here. Our first and last time adventuring to themed rooms that are not part of the Cove Haven Resorts has backfired and will never happen again. Seriously, spend the extra travel and money to go somewhere more reputable and safe.  The two stars is for the super nice pictures and the Jacuzzi.

"I was here three nights in a row. When I checked in and went up to my floor as the elevator doors opened I was hit with two unwanted sensations - Marijuana smoke and loud rap music. The music was so loud with bass so thumping I turned around, went down to the front desk to change rooms. The front desk clerk said they'd already had complaints and ""we are sending someone up, you'll be fine"". I made her change my room and why hadn't she already sent someone up if they had a complaint? The room was ok but the carpet is worn stained and the air conditioner stopped working around 3am and smelled like it was burning up. I need the white noise to sleep and was awaken constantly by doors slamming starting at 4:30am. The second night was better but the maid set my shower head so it would nail me when I turned it on, which is always nice with cold water. The third night I had to move rooms since they had booking issues because their property across the street had a roof leak and it closed the whole hotel. AVOID ROOM 202 AT ALL COST! It's right next to the highway and I'd had an equal night sleep had I choosen a cot in the median of the highway, it was like the windows were open and every truck motorcycle and hot rod could be heard too clearly, I tried to sleep in but the maid knocked (I had my do not disturb sign on my door and it was there when I opened it) she just wanted to know if I'd checked out already, this was at 9am, my checkout was set to noon. Needless to say I wasn't very friendly and when I complained to the front desk they said housekeeping isn't supposed to knock when my DND is out.  I would avoid this property as well as the Four Points across the street (Massive flooding inside= mold) and the Sheridan Suites, they are all owned by the same company, I've stayed in all three and they always make me sorry my company didn't put me in a Marriott property.  p.s. bring flip flops - the grout in the bathroom is completely gross.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 1.0

"OK, I had an issue, I felt it never got resolved, but through the power of Yelp (yeah Yelp!), the hotel manager reached out to me and offered what I feel is fair compensation for the issue.  I left a garment bag in the room when I checked out with a nice suit (not an Armani, but it was several $100) and a well worn leather jacket.  When I got home, it took me a few days to realize I didn't have it, and when I did contact the hotel, I was told that they had it and would keep it for me.    Flash forward 4 months and I am ready to head back up that way, so I would stop by to grab the suit.  I send an email to the guy I had been talking to, and I get a response that he is no longer there.  Then I get an email from someone in housekeeping that the suit and jacket were donated after 3 months.  A week later I sent an email to the General Manager, and didn't hear back.  After posting a rather scathing review here, Jason reached out to me, having never heard of this issue before now (his brother, the GM, somehow missed my email to him).  We discussed the issue, he talked about raising the issue with the staff at his managers meeting, and he offered to compensate me for what was lost.  I am not getting my suit or jacket back, but overall I feel that he is meeting me at least 1/2 way.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 4.0

I was so impressed with the food, I even hosted a dinner here bc I knew it would be a hit with my friends.  Their super extensive menu will satisfy every one. They even have a separate section for vegetarians and vegans! They offer a wide range of heat options - 1 being mild enough for my friend who hates ketchup (lol) thru 4. I am a 2, mild spice but my fiance can take 3 level heat, but he's hot like that. :-)  I have ordered off the vegan menu and my fiance has order the chicken versions and we both rave about our meals. I had the tofu korma (rich and flavorful) and the channa masala. Both have sauces that are so addicting, you'll be a converter too.  My first trip I ordered what sounded safe - the vegetable samosa. A lot of minced veggie filling and not greasy. Perfection! My second time, I experimented with the tamarind eggplant appetizer... OH- MY - GOSH. This. Get this. It sounds different but I promise it is worth it.

Instead of pita, they brought around these thick wedges of a cake-y white bread.  It was impossible to scoop up our food with it, and our hands were all covered with sauce.  Also, the Moroccan wine by the glass -- really really chewy.  Better to splurge on a bottle of better wine (around $30).

"Buyer beware,stay far away from this company as possible. Their work is horrible and thats stating it lightly. They are not professional, honest,trustworthy and meticulous about their work. They will rush whatever service YOU'RE PAYING THEM FOR so they can rush to the next job site.THEY WILL TRY AND SELL YOU ADDITIONAL PACKAGES AT A HIGHER RATE. AND IF YOU AGREE TO THE UPGRA7DE. Will do the work so poorly that they will admit that their not satisfied with the work they've done and charge you for what you initially asked for. I've tried calling to express my concerns of the horrible job done. Only to receive a phone call from a person who said he was the owner and that he doesn't normally send another crew out to redo a steam cleaning but he would do so at an additional cost to me. I was told that the tech has a two hour window to complete the service and move on to the next site. So the tech came in after 2pm cleaned his brushes in my bathtub for approximately twenty minutes. Set up and supposedly shampooed 3 rooms a hallway and down the stairs. Went out got the steam cleaning machine and proceeded to do the same. Packup get paid then leave a little after 4pm. So I'm asking how much of a proficient job can be performed in such a short time? I even sent pictures of how dirty the carpet still looked. So if anyone reads this just please Im warning you.

"Something really good happened to me the other day, and I want you all to know about it.  I copped a 40 of Bud Light from a Mexican grocery store, which is one of the few good places to get a 40 out here in the county. I was getting ready to take it to the head, and I figured I'd also eat some potato chips, because sometimes I get hungry when I'm putting on a drunk.  I saw my little brother had some Burger King, and I asked if he had any fries left, because I heard they had new fries, and of course I was curious. I tried one, but they were too warmed over to issue a final, consequential judgment. It wouldn't have been in the best interest of citizen food journalism. Then my little brother informed me that he had another Whopper, that I could have, because they were running two for one Whoppers, so he got two, but he wasn't about to eat two, because he's not a very big guy. I'd say he's about two thirds of the average American man of 5'10. Which is odd, because I'm roughly the size of an NFL linebacker (but not quite as athletic). How that happened I'm not sure. He doesn't have the facial features of someone born with fetal alcohol syndrome, though he is kinda slow on the uptake. Hmm...  Fast forward to this afternoon I wanted to get some fried chicken for lunch, but I waited too late, and I had to bust a shift in retail, which is of course my line of work, and then I stumbled upon a particularly provocative spread in an English men's magazine (the best kind), and the next thing you know I only had about 20 minutes to get something to eat, including the time it would take to get there and back. Normally, this is the point when I would say fuck it and hit Wendy's, but Wendy's is now dead to me. Not just Dave Thomas, or Wendy, if that's an actual person, but the entire Wendy's organization as a staff, crew and a record label. West side! Plus, I had that good experience with Burger King the other day (no Boutros), and I figured I should follow it up with a full-on review.  The plan was to get the buy one get one Whoppers and (duh) actually eat both of them, plus some of their new fries. But when I hit the drive thru, I was informed that the Whoppers were no longer on BOGO. Today it's chicken sandwiches. Two full price Whoppers wouldn't necessarily be prohibitively expensive to a brother who just spent $25 for lunch at Pappy's the day before (by himself, mind you), but it's the principle! And the two chicken sandwiches were out of the question, because I seem to recall trying a chicken sandwich from Burger King once in 1993 and not really caring for it, and why would I want two of something I didn't want one of? Maybe if I could have gotten one chicken sandwich at half price and one Whopper, but you know how it is trying to negotiate with people at fast food restaurants.  The other main thing they had advertised were those BK Toppers, and that's what I ended up getting. They come in your choice of Mushroom and Swiss, Deluxe (yet another knockoff version of a Big Mac), and Western Barbecue, with barbecue sauce and onion rings, like on that Tenacious D album. The tagline in ads for these pieces of crap is ""more meat, more value,"" or something along those lines, but that's a goddamn lie. The meat on a BK Topper is just large enough that it can't be considered a slider, according to the National Sandwich Rating Board. But it would be cool if it actually were as small as a slider, because then it would be a slider. (Think about it.) And I'm not sure if it's real meat either. It doesn't taste like the meat they use on a Whopper. It tastes like one of those Landshire hamburgers you get at a gas station. Don't ask me how I know this.  And then there was the fries. In theory, they were the best fries ever. They combine the best parts of the old fries at Wendy's and the fries at McDonald's, the best fries of all time, of ALL TIME. They might even be bigger around than the old Wendy's fries, but they've got a crunchy, salty exterior. But, alas, said crunchy, salty still ain't as good as the fries at McDonald's - and the extra potato inside is hardly any consolation. If I want more potato, I can always just super size it. Burger King just don't have the technology McDonalds uses to make it's food so delicious. Though I suspect they have been working on it. Their new fries must contain more than just potatoes and salt. I accidentally dropped one on the floor, and my brother's dog refused to eat it. She didn't seem to recognize it as food. True story.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

You can have the fanciest technology in the world, but when you stray from the companies core values of fast friendly service by having employees with attitude combined with taking longer to prepare a meal than it takes for me to do so at home, you should probably just close.

"Our stay at the chase was terrible. It was my wedding night and  we had nothing with us and were in need if a few items. The front desk was less than accommodating to our needs telling us they would not be able to just charge our credit card on file and bring up the items, but instead we needed to come down. Later I called for some Tylenol to be brought up and was told it would be up shortly. 45 minutes later nothing. I went down to the desk wearing just my tux pants barefoot, only to be told they did not have any, and the one key to the gift shop that was supposed to be left behind for the night was missing- they told me that I would have to either drive or hail a cab to walgreens. There was no apology offered for not calling to inform us there was not going to be anyone coming up as promised.

"A few weeks ago, we had the opportunity to check out Mangroves in South Tampa for a Blogger Brunch. That day was my first time entering the doors at Mangroves and I knew quickly they wouldn't be the last. Mangroves has a certain feel to it - upscale and trendy without being pretentious. Not at all what I was expecting and this little gem surpassed my expectations.  Gabe and I had the opportunity to check out Mangroves for dinner and after sampling the brunch treats, I knew we were  in for a treat. The first thing I noted was the size of Mangroves menu. There were no more than 4 items per category. I usually find that restaurants who opt for smaller menus perfect their dishes  vs. those restaurants who have a menu the size of a book.  We started off with a pitcher of Sangria. Gabe is a HUGE fan of Sangria. His Sangria snob factor is equal to mine of wine. He told me multiple times that Mangroves Sangria was in his top two.  The first thing I noticed on the dinner menu was the Crab Cakes with a coconut and macadamia nut crust, a mango slaw and pineapple buerre blanc. The coconut macadamia nut crust was a home run.  It made this crab cake stand out from any other I have ever tasted. The bluerre blanc....I almost licked the plate clean. It was that good. Rich, sweet but not too sweet, rich, tropical. Then the crab cake - Gabe and I got in a discussion over the crab. It wasn't lump crab it looked like blue crab. I thought it was blue crab and Gabe said it couldn't be as it wasn't fishy. I asked and sure enough, I was right. Awesome job Chef!  Once we heard the specials of the night, for the first time in our 3+ year relationship, this happened: Gabe ordered soup and I ordered salad. I am a soup girl and usually go straight for it. Not this time! Gabe ordered the Creole Crab Bisque. It was very good and had a great amount of crab but in Gabe's words, just coming back from NOLA, it could have used a little more Creole spice. I am not knocking on the soup though, again, very good.  The reason I opted for salad vs. soup was one word - cilantro. I am obsessed with cilantro and it is one of my favorite spices. I also have a weakness for a good Ceaser salad. With that said  when I saw the Cilantro Ceaser on the menu, I knew I had to order it. There aren't many Ceasers that live up to my expectations. Mangroves presented me with a beautiful and delicious salad topped with Manchego cheese and I will surely order it again.  While Mangroves had a great fish lineup, I was craving red meat. I have been to multiple food events over the past week who featured a lot of fish dishes (not complaining). Unless we are at a Steak House, I generally order fish or chicken. I also try to order opposite from Gabe but tonight, we both opted for a red meat entree.  Mine - WOW. My first gut reaction was that I didn't want to order a Filet at Mangroves. I am a Filet snob and Mangroves isn't a prime steakhouse. Yet our server strongly suggested it and I caved in, thank the lord. When I sit here and tell you that this filet was hands down up there with Ruths Chris, I am not lying or exaggerating. It was perfect, from the temperature it was cooked, the flavor and most important, the tenderness. It cut like butter and I loved every moment of it. Please - do yourself a favor. If you go to Mangroves for dinner, order this dish. Of everything I have ate this week, it was hands down my favorite.  Gabe ordered the Chimmichurri grilled hangar steak. We are huge fans of chimmichurri and this steak was excellent. We are very familiar with Argentinian style steaks and I wasn't expecting to see it sliced but it was still a great steak.  Overall Mangroves impressed me once again. I am very happy we were introduced to Mangroves and will be back to visit again!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Well, the flavor of the steaks was excellent.  Sadly, we will never return.  It had been about 15 years since our last visit.  The restaurant must have gone down hill since our first visit.  I really don't know where to start.. First of all there is no Air Conditioning.  It was 103 when we arrived at 5:50 pm.  The fans in the dinning area didn't help in keeping us cool Next, there are no menus, and when the servers tell you what they have (steaks) there is no mention of prices. You sit on benches with a plastic table cloth and we were given our own water curaff. Our butter came out in wraped butter patties and the sour cream in little boxes. We were very specific with the server about the temperature of our steaks.  I knew we were in trouble when we saw a young man (about 15/16) griling our steaks.  Both steaks were overdone.   Finally, we got the bill.  We had to wait about 15 minutes after our plates were cleared as our server (she had worked there for 28 years) was too busy flurting and working a table of men behind me.  There were only three tables in the restaurant and she only had us the the men.  When I looked at the bill, I was shocked.  The meals each cost about $30!!!!

I had a friend who had wanted to go to Longhorn because of the closeness to the commute home. We stopped in and we're quickly seated. The waitress was awesome. That is about were the good review stops. We ordered the parmesan crusted asparagus which was okay but lacking a bit of flavor. The French onion soup followed suit. We both ordered a cesar salad and felt like we were eating a Dole bagged salad out of the local grocery store. The parmesan crusted chicken was moist but again lacked any true flavor and parts of the parmesan was over cooked so it held a burnt taste. The Pork chops that I ordered were a bit dry and again had zero flavor. The Mac and cheese was delicious and is the real reason I am giving the 2 stars.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"There's certainly no dearth of Mexican joints that deliver in S. Philly, but I've had some pretty simple food be pretty crappy so I decided to move a few blocks East in my search for a few decent tacos for lunch. I have to say that all I've ordered from Fiesta Acapulco are the chicken tacos, with queso chihuahua ($1.00 extra, but since it comes from the milk of such a small dog, it's an understandably pricey delicacy)   The tacos are always excellent, delivered with plenty of lime and cucumber slices. My last order (today) came with an unwelcome surprise that was quickly remedied. The delivery guy arrived without ANY change so I was forced to tip him $9 on an $11 order. He promised to come back later; I rolled my eyes and shut the door, content to eat the tacos and the loss. To my great surprise, 90 minutes later he showed up with my change, apologizing for the inconvenience. I'll definitely continue to patronage them, maybe even trying something else next time.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday with my son. Restaurant was about half full. Covid protocols were still in place even though the county had dropped restrictions the day before but I'll give them a pass. We ordered quickly and grabbed our drinks. Our order was ready within 8 mins and we grabbed our food. Due to Covid the sauce bar is almost nonexistent. Produce looked fresh and colorful. My grilled chicken sandwich was cooked to perfection along with the fries and bun. My son's kid meal burger was cooked well and the flavor was great.

"Funny ""expected vs reality"" moment came to life this past weekend! The historic train ride was neat but the foliage wasn't really there because it was too late into the season. Every volunteer staff was super nice! And the train ride was smooth!   The total train ride was 90 minutes....30s minutes to Glen Mill station then we stopped for about 25 minutes for a quick picnic or a walk then hopped back into the train for another 30s minutes to get back to where we started.   There were plenty of parking space but the people who come for a 2pm ride would take longer to park because it takes time for the 12pm people to leave the lot.   We came with a family of 8 so we sat all together on the way to Glen Mill station but on the way back a couple took our seats so we had to split up. It was a little chaos for everyone who came with a family of more than 2 persons to find seatings all over again.

"What is up with this place!? Holy crap it's awesome. Honestly, I didn't think anyone would drool over grilled cheese and onion rings but American Sardine Bar made me do just that. We each ordered a main dish and a side and shared bites here and there of each others food. We passed around big bowls of spicy brussel sprouts, onion rings and french fries with pickle dipping sauces. Not a complaint from any of us... we were too busy stuffing our faces. The beers on tap looked good and reasonably priced, and the jukebox played some chill tunes. It's small and dimly lit but the atmosphere is cool and laid back. The bar goes on forever so it can accommodate quite a few folks. And let's not forget about the service! friendly as can be and helpful. When I asked if they had ciders and they didn't, the waitress suggested something else for me that was just lovely.

"My boyfriend and I were out and about and decided we wanted to get a pizza for dinner. Sure enough, Pizza Shackamaxon was right across the street, so it seemed like the perfect opportunity to give it a try.   If you're just walking into the shop, you can only buy pizza by the slice, otherwise you have to reserve ahead of time. However, the gentleman working behind the counter was kind enough to make an exception of us and allowed us to order a whole pie for take out. Within 30 minutes, we got a fresh pie.   The pizza itself is some of the best I've ever had in Philly. One aspect we love about this place is the fact all of the ingredients are very fresh. They use freshly grated cheese instead of the processed stuff that comes in industrial size (there was literally a guy behind the counter grating a huge block of cheese). You can also taste fresh tomato chunks in the sauce. The crust has a nice crispy outer layer with a thick, chewy center. The center had the consistency of freshly baked bread.   If you're looking for a pizzeria that prioritizes the use of fresh ingredients, this is definitely worth checking out!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

All the waitress Had to do was come to the table right after ""everyone"" was served to realize the problem. The restaurant was basically empty at 7:45am on a Thursday so it's not like she was busy. After about 20 minutes after everyone was mostly finished, the last person finally got their food. No manager came over to apologize. Of course the bill came with a 18% gratuity built in. The appropriate tip was 10% and that was generous for this service and lack of ""making it right.""  Never dining here again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
I was excited to try this restaurant tonight for my birthday as it's a New Orleans staple. Disappointed is an understatement. Once seated we waited 15-20 minutes for a server to even acknowledge our table. Our reservation was on a Saturday at 7:30 pm. The restaurant wasn't even that crowded so why the long wait I have no idea. We ordered appetizers and drinks. Somehow the drinks came out right before the appetizers. I got the strawberry aperol spritz which was disgusting. I told the waitress I didn't care for it and wanted to order something else. She said Unfortunately they can't take drinks back so I was basically stuck with a $13 nasty drink. Our food came Out and parts of it were wrong. We ordered bbq shrimp as one of the apps and that never even made it to the table. Every other table received bread....we asked was told they were toasting it. Bread came out cold. To really top it off the food was mediocre. Highly disappointed in the food and the service. Will not return.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"The inside atmosphere is beautiful. They have a private room (not so private because it is only separated by glass) that can seat up to 12. We ordered almost every appetizer on the menu.  Fried chicken karaage: nice flavor and fried perfectly. The kids loved this one.  Dim sum Shumai: soft and tender with just enough juiciness. Aged dashi tofu: this one was not our favorite, it definitely lacked in flavor Tempura: nice big portion with three shrimps & mixed veggies such as onion, zucchini, broccoli & sweet potato Hamachi-Kama: this was probably our favorite app, it was a much bigger piece than we thought and it wasn't too fishy with just enough flavor once you squirted some lemon Miso grilled corn: these were on the cob with loads of delicious flavors!  Sushi rolls: blue moon was a bit too fishy for our taste. Crispy spicy tuna was out of this world! I have never had anything like it. It was perfectly crunchy on the bottom with yummy tuna on top.

"I thought that I should update my 5 star review.  Yelp only lets me give 5, but if I could, I would gladly give Dr. Gardner 10 and an A plus, like he always gives me on my checkups!  I have been a patient of Dr. Gardner's for over a year now, and I really enjoy my dental visits because I can relax, close my eyes and because I trust him with my teeth, my teeth and gums have improved in health since coming  initially.  When I first met Dr. Gardner a few years ago, he said that I needed root canal, and I chickened out, I neglected my teeth.  When Dr. Gardner did a filling last year, it was a big filling because of my poor eating habits and neglect of my dental care but it got me to take better care of my teeth.  Now I have a Sonicare, I have been cavity free for awhile, and my most recent cleaning was easier for me because I'm taking better care of my dental hygiene.    I think that it can be understandable for people to be nervous at the dentist and to neglect their teeth because of their anxiety.  Dr. Gardner has been so kind and sweet, he explains everything that he does with his diagrams, models, he has always kept me involved and let me feel that I am educated and well taken care of, so I can take a deep breath and relax.    I never thought that I would enjoy going to the dentist, but now I really look forward to it!

"I've been having some shoulder and neck pain the past few weeks- probably since I hunch over my laptop all day- and scheduled an emergency massage at Joseph Anthony. I called around Monday or Tuesday to see if they had any appointments Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. The woman told me they book up on weekends a few weeks in advance, but had a cancellation on Sunday. They also had some openings for Friday during the day. I picked an 85-minute Friday appointment. My only complaint: I found their website very confusing when I was attempting to look up services and cost. Making a more user-friendly website would probably go a long way.   When I came in, they told me the spa was upstairs. I went up, checked in and filled out some paperwork. I then waited for a few 5 minutes before they took me back to the locker area, which was small but nice. They didn't have a changing area, which I didn't mind, but one of the older women did- she ended up changing in the bathroom. They then told me to go into a ""transition"" room. The room was full, with about 5 other people in there, and they were all friendly and a tiny bit chatty- I'd have preferred the transition room to be a bit quieter. The staff poured me a hot foot bath, with a choice of lemongrass or lavender oil, which was a nice touch. Jenny then took me back for my massage on time, although a few people in the room were waiting a bit past their appointment time.   Jenny was an awesome masseuse. She was friendly and professional, and talked through everything before we started. I had a deep-tissue massage, and she did great at giving the perfect amount of pressure (I told her I liked a lot of pressure, and she delivered!). My neck and shoulders are a tiny bit sore today (in a good way), and feel so much better than they did. I'll definitely be going back to see Jenny the next time something hurts!! The 85-minute deep tissue massage was with a ""level 3"" masseuse, for $165. They do levels based on experience, with a ""level 1"" masseuse costing $145 for the same 85-minute deep tissue massage. While pricey, I felt like Jenny was worth the cost! I find it really hard to find people who give great deep tissue massages.  Overall, I'd definitely come back, specifically to see Jenny. The other things like the foot bath are a nice touch, but I don't care particularly for them- I mostly just care about getting a fantastic massage. However, I do have to say that I was relaxed by the time I walked into the massage room, which doesn't happen all that often!

"I will never do business with this place and will never recommend them to my network of friends and co-workers.   Wife and I came here about a month ago. We were in the market for a memory foam mattress and a couch set. We dealt with someone named Domingo which he apparently wears many hats from Sales person, to Sales manager to eventually a store manager. He was nice in the beginning. We had questions and he answered them. We actually left because we had to think twice.   We came back 2 weeks later and ready to buy. First red flag was that my wife specifically wanted a mattress which Domingo said was available in stock when it was time for us to pick it up, it wasn't available and we were forced to take a different mattress. Big mistake.   Another mistake was when we asked him about the couch set if it doesn't workout for us because of size or color or whatever, he said we can return it for exchange. I know for sure he mentioned this because my wife as the one who asked and we wouldn't jump on this if it wasn't exchangeable. So we decided to move forward.   We receive our couch set 2 weeks later. And guess what, we wanted to exchange the couch set. Called Domingo the same day we got the couch and to my surprise he said we can't return it or exchange it. I reasoned with him several times and he basically accused me of making up stories about him saying we can exchange it. Even when I pointed out that my wife was there listening and even asking about that. I can't believe such company doesnt have a return or exchange policy I mean what kind of business is that?    I went ahead and looked at our contract and had my wife call Domingo back this time though to let him know we are cancelling our lease contract. His demeanor change. I'm pretty sure it was because he was talking to my wife and because we are not in a position to cancel our contract and cut business with them. He immediately came back on the phone after placing us on hold and giving us the round around to buy us time and said, ""We don't want you guys to cancel your contract. We'll take care of you guys and exchange the couch set for you. We also dont want you to pay any cancellation fees"" all of a sudden he's back to the first Domingo we met.   This guy Domingo thought he can just take advantage of us because we are young and in our mid-20's. He forgot we are educated young couple who can READ are also familiar with business and sales. We decided to cancel our contract the next day and called the leasing company. They told us that they are NO fees to cancel and we have every right to cancel and terminate our business if we wanted too. Once again sales guy, manager whoever he is, is flat out wrong and lying.   As I mentioned above, take your business somewhere else. If you need to come here out of desperation, please deal with someone anybody besides Domingo. It's true what they say with people in sales, they'll say and do anything just to get your money but they don't have the customer service to back it up.

"This is my 2nd visit tl this location, 1st time was terrible, 2nd time much better. The restaurant was very clean, music option was awesome, service sub par. The food in general was very fresh, still piping hot when we started eating. The biggest complaint and what we felt ruined the meal was the BUN CHOICE... It was way to weak to hold even the basic options. I had to scrape everything off towards the end...the burger was falling apart in my hands. The toppings were all fresh,  it looked awesome..just didnt deliver.  The burger in general needed seasoning..at least salt and pepper, the fries were hands down the best part of the meal...hot, crunchy and flavorful. For the price I definitely wont be going back, we only went because we had a gift card.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I needed to have a pre-employment physical and a TB test done, I called and scheduled it at this clinic in Walgreens, I had no problem getting an appt for 9:30am the next morning. I arrived and checked in at the kiosk this was all very simple and easy. The technician greeted me within 1 minute of my checking in. I saw the ARNP after a bout a five minute wait. She was thorough and efficient, she did a pretty extensive physical the cost of the physical was $75.00, and the cost of the TB test was $28.00 which included me coming back to have it read in two days, and she signed off on the paper work I needed for my employer. The technician scheduled my follow up visit to have the TB test read for two days later. I went for that visit and was seen immediately was in and out in five minutes. The clinic was very clean and well organized. I would definitely use them again.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 4.0

"At first I was so so about this place. I ordered the Pad Thai wings and the Red snapper fish with Panang sauce. The chicken wings were just okay to me and the fish was very tough to eat as well as the veggies. I had to send back the fish, bc I really couldn't eat it. I guess it was way over cooked to me.  My hubby ordered the pad Thai with beef and added chicken and it was so good so I ordered that with shrimp and tofu. I think that's the best pad thai I have had in forever. But I was so full already because they gave us spring rolls and crab Rangoon for free since it was their one year anniversary. There was so much Pad thai that both of us took home that it filled each container. It was a good price too for that heaping serving!  Our server was amazing. She was running around everywhere, and always had a smile on her face. There was another male server who was okay but the one we had she did everything. Give her a promotion I say!

"I have never been to a restaurant where they can't prepare an entry according to your request. I tried to order a burger medium well as the waitress stated the burger can only be cooked three ways( Rare, Medium, and Well) and nothing in between. We even asked the manager about this and her response was the kitchen will only prepare the three ways as it will slow down the process. I assume they have three grills and temperature is set to rare, medium and well. That's B.S. So who's running the show, the cook or the management. It's hard to believe that my request to have burger cooked medium well can't be accomplished. So much for the customer.

"Absolutely horrible experience. They care nothing about treating their customers right. Ordered a chair and went to the warehouse for pickup, and the warehouse worker dropped it and broke a leg right in front of me. Then while he was trying to repair it, we noticed the chair had gotten smudged and stained and the warehouse guy tried claiming it was always that way. It was brand new when I bought it! Had to leave without the chair so they could repair and clean it. Then they refused to deliver it unless I drove all the way out to the warehouse again to ""look at it."" I asked if they'd managed to clean it and they would not give an answer. When I asked if they would be offering a discount since I purchased a new chair that they damaged, they said they would promise nothing, but if they chose to offer a discount, they would rescind the free delivery. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Finally had them refund the whole thing. I will never go back and I'm telling everyone I know not to shop there as they disrespect and mistreat their customers and their purchases.",Business Category: Home & Garden,Review Stars: 1.0

"I go to the Freedom Smoke on Grant & Oracle.   All I want to do is pop in for a bottle of juice, but every time I come I have to wait 20 mins just to order my juice because there's a person in front of me trying every damn juice flavor and can't make up their mind.  Sometimes there are actually 2 employees working the front customer service counter and I still wait 15-20 mins just to tell them what type of juice I want. Then I have to wait another 15-20 mins for it to be brought to me. This should be a 5-10 min process altogether. I shouldn't be waiting  40 mins just to buy some nicotine juice. It's quicker to get an oil change on my car.   I know there are more employees in the back because I see different ppl walking in and out of the Employees only door. I just wish someone would come to the front when there's 5 ppl in line behind 2 customers at the counter who want to try every flavor.  OR, maybe customer service could ask them to step aside while they figure out what they want, and take my order,  because I already know what I want.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 1.0
"GOTTA READ UNTIL THE END TO UNDERSTAND.   I can't believe I did business with this establishment again after the first time I was verbally abused here- but, I did and it was an awful experience. I purchased an iPhone from this company and 4 days later the screen went black. I brought the phone back thinking  no big deal it's only been 4 days. Surly enough I was wrong I was spoken to aggressively and belittled as a human by the disrespectful representative I will NEVER DO BUSINESS THERE AGAIN nor would I recommend anyone to do business here.  7:09 pm 03/07/2017 Then the rep had the nerve to call me and argue with me about my review and really was trying to go back and fourth with me about it l. Sounds a lot like harassment I'll have my lawyers take a look into this.  7:23 pm 03/07/2017 I received a call from someone claiming to be a manager and he too wanted to argue about why I wrong such a horrid review, defending his tenured employee stating that it must be me that has the problem and because I won't be satisfied either way that the company refuses to fix my phone that I purchased from them! I was a little baffled by the call because initially he sound like he cared about his customers satisfaction, until I started telling him how rude his employee was. That's when he became enraged and begin to tell me how wrong I was. This is the second call where I was being harassed and over talked and just plan out disrespected.  03/08/17 After having the two conversations with Saber and Tony yesterday. I had planned on picking up a phone that was still broken.

"Seated quickly with a last minute reservation. Then we waited and waited and waited. When the waitress finally got there she took our drink order and we waited and waited and waited again for them to arrive.   It seems they use a few ""runners"" to bring food so the waitstaff don't have to. Well this adds to the wait. The runners stop and search for tables. Have more than one tables so are often confused about what table gets what and who at the table gets each item. Adds to the already long wait for food and drinks   Food was ok, veggie burger was more spicy than one would expect, clam chowder was good and the Thai chicken salad was huge and good as well.   The fresh baked focaccia was the highlight of the meal. Combined with their olive oil and flavored was great. If bread makes a meal I'd give them 5 stars, but this is not a bread bakery, it's supposed to be a restaurant so I graded them like one.

"This is a review of the casino only.  I have visited Circus Circus Reno's casino many times in the last ten years and was always pleased by the mix of machines and table games. Last night I visited CCR even though I was staying at another property in Reno, and I was astonished to see that all of the table games were gone. They have been replaced in some cases by mechanized versions such as a large mechanized roulette machine. Of course, the experience of playing mechanized roulette is far different from a physical table game. So all the dealers are gone, and the casino was lacking in energy on a holiday weekend. I could see no explanation posted for this strange state of affairs.  UPDATE: The day after I posted the above, I was playing a table game at another Reno casino and asked the dealer if she knew anything about the absense of table games at Circus Circus. She said that 2-3 months ago the Circus Circus management got rid of all the table games and fired all the dealers. What was more, the management -- which owns the two adjacent properties, the Eldorado and the Sliver Legacy -- refused to hire the Circus Circus dealers for those properties. Some other players at the table with me who were familiar with the situation remarked that the atmosphere at the Circus Circus was just not the same and that they no longer saw a reason to visit. I have to say I agree.  Granted, these explanations and comments do not reflect any comments by Circus Circus management. Since they have commented on other reviews of their property, I look forward to seeing any comments they have on the absent table games and the vanquished dealers.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 3.0

"First off I saw one of the comments referred to this particular Shoney's as being in the ghetto. I live in Woodbine in this said neighborhood, who knew I lived in a ghetto? Vanderbilt is in this neighborhood as well...NOT THE GHETTO.   Saying all that, back to the restaurant. My friend/sister and I go there at least 2 times a week. They make the absolute BEST turkey club in all of Nashville. I kid you not. We are retired so we have gone to many of the restaurants new and old. Now days it's a theme to fancy up things like club sandwiches...Shoney's still makes an original ""no need to fix it, it ain't broken"" club sandwich. I like the buffet. When the Chicken first comes out, you will not find better. The buffet is never ""nasty"". They are maintaining and cleaning any spills. I've never seen rancid or over ripe veggies or lettuces. The hot food represents Old fashioned cookery. Some of the veggies are overcooked, but that is how they taste good with the seasoning. Their greens are just the way I like them. Cornbread muffins to soak up the ""pot licker""...mmmmm. Shoney's makes the best sweet tea! You can taste the brew. I've never gotten a bad glass of tea. The cost of the buffet is so reasonable in my opinion. You can't expect ""fusion"", ""gourmet""...it's ""country"" fare.   As far as the service goes: we go often and get great service. My tea glass never stays empty for long. We bring our family sometimes and everyone leaves happy. Our favorites are Tessa and Kayla and Lorenzo. But like I said we never get poor service. The Managers are always on hand. They do everything. From cooking, to fixing the deep fryer to mopping floors. The bathrooms always have paper and soap in the dispensers. They are as clean as most places we visit. The problem isn't the servers, it's the customers who have poor eating habits. I have seen whole groups come in and leave a horrid mess for the servers to clean up. My friend is blind and they will help her to the restroom...they see we have many napkins. Our glasses never stay empty for long. I didn't give the restaurant 5 stars because that seems for a fancy gourmet place.

"Went to this cruise for two big school events. Exactly the same each time. They greet everyone as they board. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The food was delicious. They did a pretty good job hosting a big group. Perfect for a romantic night. Majority of the seating were by the windows. Three separate floors with each different music. Definitely plan the outfit or the time of the cruise if you want to enjoy the scenery outside the boat.   The security guard was just doing his job, but I wish he was more understanding of girls how painful it is to be in heels, haha. He sternly asked us to wear the heels back on. The drinks were extremely watered down and with ice filled to the top of the plastic cups. Hopefully this is the case because we're a big school group. Better off getting the bottled beer.

We had issues with the host (took our name to wait for a table and then could not find us...we were seated 3 feet in front of him at the bar), manager (annoyed when we asked when our table would be ready...remember, they couldn't find us...and we were seated right there having this obviously annoying conversation from the bar stool!), to the bartenders who were not attentive at all even when new people arrived, to the waitress (personality of a placemat and walked by table glancing at drinks but not offering refills) to...and this is my favorite...the bus-woman who took my friend's plate with her sitting there without asking if she was finished...then when she saw the incredulous looks on all our faces, tried to put it back after being piled on plates from other tables.

They are very knowledgeable on the subject. I love to order multiple smaller cups of tea when I am there so I can taste more than one flavor. The wall of loose teas helps a great deal so you are able to smell the leaves.  Honestly, I have had food there and even though they do not have a very extensive menu, the food is great! The Thai pumpkin soup is to die for and I had a delicious panini there as well. It is a great atmosphere to catch up with a friend over a pot of tea. I love going to do my homework and have some tea to wake me up.  My only complaint is that they do not have great hours. The latest they are open is 10pm and on Sundays only until 6pm. It seems to be a trend with tea lounges to close early--most are 7pm every night.   Also, the tables are a little tiny to do work with a friend.

"I got a really good deal on this hotel during a 2 night stay on Memorial Day Weekend and it probably helped that I booked it about 2 months before my stay. I read very mixed reviews and found out they had just renovated the hotel at the end of 2012. But from the moment we arrived, I felt like I walked into a 5 star boutique hotel. There was a bell man that greeted us and told us valet was $38, but that there was a garage around the corner we can leave our car at for $21 with NO in and out privileges. Thought that was nice of the staff to offer the option since they weren't affiliated.   The lobby is small, but it didn't pose a problem. We had a corner room that overlooked Walnut St. with the row of shops! The room was very nicely decorated, clean, and spacious for 2 doubles. The bathroom was a decent size, but was clean, and modern looking. The room also came with keurig coffee and an empty fridge. The hotel offers an Audi town car that takes you anywhere within a 1 mile distance for free! They'll even pick you up if they're available. This is super convenient if you can wait since it is on a first come, first serve basis and there's only one car. The hotel is located close to shops and DELICIOUS restaurants. They're less than a block away! Public transportation is also close by and easily accessible.  It's also good to note that the housekeeping lady was one of the nicer people we ran into on the East Coast.   Since we had some delicious leftovers from dinner the night before, I asked the front desk if there was a microwave we could use. The lady got on her walkie talkie and asked someone to deliver a microwave to our room. I don't know if that's normal service, but I've never heard of that before and that is above and beyond my expectations. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone especially if you can get a decent deal.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 5.0

Nevermind it's YOUR wedding day, and a day to be happy, if you interrupt this lady from sitting behind her desk, eating her feelings away, she will treat you like the scum on the bottom of her shoe. And her excuse... ""she just bought a house so she doesn't want to be working"". Well guess what you swine, I have a million reasons I don't want to be my job, but that doesn't make me treat happy, paying customers rudely for no reason at all. Hopefully once the old lady at this place kicks the bucket, and the fat ones eat themselves to death, this place will close for good, because no one should ever waste their time even setting foot in this sorry excuse for a wedding chapel. This place is pretty horrible. I read the reviews beforehand so can't say I'm surprised, but you would think since you're paying a minimum of $80 for literally 5 minutes of their time, they would be even a tiny bit nice or helpful, but no. From the second we walked in until leaving, these women were some of the rudest, most miserable human beings you could imagine. And then after it's all said and done, they tell you it's customary to leave between $30-$60 gratuity. Last time I checked, gratuity is something you leave when you are happy with the services preformed, and if that's how much you people are going to ask for, you could at least pretend to not be so miserable. I tipped $9, and even that was too much. But I figured it would help with buying the next Big Mac for this Oompa Loompa looking twat.

"My sister went to this location last week and walked out with a pretty cute haircut. She said it look longer than normal for a trim, but it was worth it. I went in to get a single process hair dye done. My roots were growing out and the color was faded so I needed an update. It was slow so I was seated with Helene almost immediately. I only know her name because someone said her name later.  Around 12:45 she started putting in the color. I'm not much of a talker when I don't have my glasses on (weird I know) and my lack of conversation seemed to make my hair dresser uncomfortable. It felt like the appointment was going slowly, but I did not realize how long it was taking until I texted someone that she had just finished putting in the color and I had to sit for another half hour at 1:36. It took her almost an hour to apply the color to my shortish hair. By the time she washed it out I was so ready to leave. I had been there for almost 2 hours by the time it was all said and done. In the end there was still a bunch of dye on my face, and the color isn't my favorite. Turns out I had the same person my sister did. I waited a day to wash my hair when normally I would wait 2 because my scalp felt really irritated in places, and it was a little difficult to brush with my hair being a weird texture. I started by rinsing my hair with cool water and the amount of color that rinsed out was horrifying. I had my hair dyed red, so you can imagine what my shower looked like.  The reason I gave 3 stars is because I had a ton of time to listen in to the people who were working around her, and they were all super kind, fun, quick and all their clients seemed happy when they left.

"Cooper's Hawk laid a big egg for Easter lunch. As you walk in, the first thing that slaps you in the face is the gift shop hawking Dollar General junk. I came for dinner, not to shop! Then you have effete snobs swirling their wine glasses full of mediocre wine at the bar.   The server was friendly but it ended there;  no water refills and I was so thirsty I was going to drink water from the flower vase. She recommended the short rib risotto which two persons ordered. One risotto was good but the other serving had many globs of fat that were impersonating being a short rib. We showed the server the mounds of fat which she took to the chef and never returned. The glob of fat didn't swallow her as she returned later after we flagged her down 20-25 minutes later.   I had the surf turf combo of salmon and chimichurri skirt steak plus a margarita. After having maybe 1/4 of the margarita, she then asked if I wanted another margarita. What? I barely even drank the margarita sitting on the table. Is two-fisting two margaritas a thing now?  My skirt steak had no chimichurri despite requesting extra; this was a favorite dish ten years ago when I last went. The salmon was  very average. The best things were their Mexican drunken shrimp special  appetizer, chopped salad, side of roasted vegetables and the potato casserole. Never will be back, place has gone downhill since my last visit almost 10 years ago.",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 2.0

"Not too impressed with this place. The tuna ceviche was to die for though!! Guacamole was very fresh and brussels sprouts were also great. We also ordered the wings and a platter that came with rice, salsa, chicken mole, and steak. The steak was completely inedible, it was so over cooked I couldn't even bite a piece off. To make matters worse, when our server came to clear the table she saw our practically untouched plate of the steak and said would you like it boxed? We replied no, and said it was really bad. She didn't ask any questions and just took it to the back. Personally, I thought this was rude and unprofessional.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"My Bloody Mary was excellent.  My friend got the Mixed Seafood Grill.  The portion looked small when it came out, but I think it filled her up (although I had a scallop and half her crab cake.) The crab cake was excellent.  Biscuits were pretty good too.  I had a crab melt.  It was more bread than anything else.  Just bread, a slice of tomato, a very small amount of crab and a slice of cheese.    Service was extremely slow. That was probably my biggest complaint.  My water glass had lipstick all over it which our server noticed as he was setting it down in front of me.  It took about 15 minutes to get a new one. Our food took about 35 minutes to be brought out.  So while we enjoyed it, it's probably not the best place to go to for lunch if you don't have around 2 hours to spend.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 3.0
"I started a stressful graduate program a few months ago and don't know where my adrenals would be without ENCA. I have been to multiple acupuncturists over the years, but Alexa Husley (the owner) is by far the best. She is so attentive and warm whenever I come in and always takes the time to explain to me where she will be placing the acupuncture needles and what my body needs. She and many of her staff member attended Yo San University in Los Angeles, a highly selective and competitive acupuncture school. I would recommend everyone on her staff. I had never done community acupuncture until I came to ENCA. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I love it. The couches are comfy, the rooms are dimly lit, and the music is relaxing. It also feels really special to be healing alongside others. The receptionist in the front is always professional and friendly. They serve a delicious caffeine free tea (I tend to get to appointments early to gulp down a few cups before I entered the treatment room!). The treatments are on a sliding scale ($15 - $35). I am so grateful that Alexa has created a center that makes acupuncture accessible to folks from different financial situations. Also, there is always plenty of free parking outside of ENCA, and they are located conveniently next to Yeast Nashville (super delicious breakfast tacos!). I would highly recommend ENCA. I feel so lucky to have them in my community in Nashville.",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 5.0

"First, some context.  My sisters and I all have a background in the auction business.  Birthday Twin has been a PA/NJ/DE licensed auctioneer for something like 32 years, worked at an art auction house for a couple of years, and now works regularly with a group that auctions antique/vintage dolls about 3-4 times a year.    By way of Birthday Twin,  FDC, The Patriarch, the Matriarch and I have all also been involved in various ways. The Matriarch helped set up the dolls and kept a second audit track of bidders at the auctions.  I did clerical work.  The Patriarch drove everyone places and muttered about how the ugliest dolls bring the most money.  FDC was probably the least engaged, however she, too, would do setups and help make sales catalogs, etc.  In short, none of us are newbies.    Since Birthday Twin has been exclusively auctioning dolls for decades, there was little danger of me being a regular customer, as they're not my thing, nor are they FDCs.  During the Age of Corona, however, FDC became interested in general auctions, such as Brigg's, and discovered their very well designed app they use to conduct auctions in this time.    She introduced me, and one of us is definitely hooked (her) while the other has scored some nice things for herself and for resale (me).    One of the things you have to understand about general auctions is that this is most definitely ""caveat emptor"", they are not experts and there is no catalog or provenance claimed.  Everything is As Is, Where Is.  Also, since these are online there's no real ability to inspect beyond the photos they provide.  This is riskier than on-site auctions with previews where you can get a look up close, etc.   It's where my nice infrared heater I scored turned out to be a box full of household items carefully wrapped inside.  It looked like it was never opened, the taping was very industrial, and it had the right weight for a heater.  Fortunately, there are enough items with some value that I will recoup my investment plus a little extra.    Once we've won items, pickup is at their auction house in Garnet Valley/Boothwyn. I say both, because while the address is Garnet Valley, it's directly across the street from Booth's Corner, a mainstay of Boothwyn flea market culture.  The Briggs building itself is very nondescript, no fancy signs or lighting.  Lot is mostly gravel with some pavement.  On pickup days you approach one door where you yell your name to them and someone looks up your invoices, they then tell you which door to go to for pickups.   You then stand around outside and wait for someone to bring your items out and call your name.   Note: They are very strict about mask wearing, even outside, even while waiting. If you want to stay there and take your mask off, you get in your car and take it off there. Otherwise they will nicely/pointedly remind you that masks are required.  Generally, they are nice people, some funny, some perpetually having a bad day, but in general they are fine.  Once they start to recognize you, if you become a 'regular', most of the staff warm up to you.    Lastly, bring your own tools, your own packing materials, and be sure to measure.  FDC is bad about that, leaving one load of some items she bought as a game of ""Mini Van 3D Tetris"" that had the staff so impressed they offered for us to come work for them.    General item auctions can be a lot of fun, and you can score some very nice deals,.  You have to understand that this is ""as is, where is"" and sometimes what you think you're getting (an infrared space heater) turns out to be something different (a box full of household stuff).  Lastly, know the value going in, sometimes bidders drive prices way beyond auction values, I have seen some stuff go for seriously inflated prices because of this.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 5.0

But don't come here for any other reason than the amazing food. You will be so happy!!!!   also- I would love it if they added a California Cabernet on the wine list- that would be nice.

"No stuffed crust. No cheesy bread. No supreme-double-layered-everything-but-the-kitchen-sink. If you're looking for a standard, run of the mill, delivered in a box pizza; stay away from The Good Pie.  But if you want a phenomenal, unique and delicious dining experience than get to 3137 Olive St today. And be prepared for a wonderful experience.  The small restaurant is tucked away just west of downtown. If you're not looking for it, you might miss it. But once you've dined there, you will never overlook it again.  I met my friend for dinner and he had suggested The Good Pie. As soon as you walk in, you see the brick oven in the back. (That's where the magic happens.)  We started with the roasted olives and pizza bianca (fresh bread). The olives were a mixture of green and black swimming in a pool of virgin olive oil. They were slightly roasted to bring out the glorious flavor. The bread was light, fluffy and topped with herbs. (I could be dropped on a deserted island with the roasted olives and bread. I would never miss civilization.)  We split a Prosciutto Arugula pizza. The crust was a version of the bread topped with fresh arugula and thinly sliced meat. The toppings were not baked which saved the flavor and texture.  Come to think of it, I want the pizza on my deserted island along with the roasted olives.

It was super juicy and very well cooked (medium rare), which is my favorite! & The Au Jus was just the perfect touch! But trust me, it tasted great even without the au jus! Big portion too! Ended up only finishing half and taking the other half to-go.  2. Honor Burger (17$). Boyfriend ordered this one, and I only took a bite. It had a LOT of pickles and although i'm not a fan of pickles, it was actually a really good burger! BEAUTIFUL presentation too!  3. French Fries (6$). SOOO GOOOD!!!

"We are so so so so so glad we found them. They totally saved our dog's life.  Our dog hadn't been eating for about a week, then he started showing other disturbing symptoms. When we called our normal vet on a Friday morning they told us they couldn't see us until Monday. So we called Acacia, said the same exact thing, and they got us in that afternoon. Then they called back a few hours later to say they'd had a cancellation and got us in even earlier because his symptoms sounded worrisome.  To make a long story short over the next week the dog had two surgeries, one to remove the undergarments he'd dined on from his small intestine, and then another to fix a hernia that developed after surgery. He also got to have plasma infusions after his liver stopped functioning. He spent Monday through Saturday hospitalized.  All of the staff, the front desk people, the vet techs, the hospital manager and the vet himself were so amazing and supportive. They clearly cared about saving our dog, even though at times it seemed not possible. Two different staff members were telling us how anyone who had a day off was texting to check on how our dog was doing. They also made it clear that they supported whatever decisions we made regarding his care.  Everyone there was so enthusiastic and clearly like their jobs. I heard the vet asking who wanted to come in and check on the dog in the middle of the night when we first left him on Monday night and one of the girls yelled out ""I do!"" So awesome.   I think our dog flexed a good portion of the skills they have over there last week he had so many procedures.

"I would say I had a decent meal there.  I had 3 of the drink specials which were cosmopolitans. However they were not consistent, I could tell by the color and taste.  They were priced at $5 each which was nice,  not your 7, 8 and 9 dollars drinks.    I had the crabcakes over a jicama slaw.  The crabcakes were good but perhaps a tad bit overseasoned, a little too salty for my liking.  The jicama slaw, was different, but not a fan of it.  Neal the weekend manager was very engaging.  He said that they had two 4 star chefs.  But when you have two 4 star chefs and the wait staff is walking around in jeans, and any kind of shoes they want, it just lowers the class in the place for me.  Chow in Feasterville does th same thing and I hate it.  They wait staff is working in the food industry and they should dress appropriately, it is not your Mom and Pops diner for gods sake.  This is really a pet peeve of mine.  I may go back again.  Oh did I mention the 50 foot bar?   I realize they had to go with something like that due to the layout of th building.

"Now under management.  Seriously, Van Goghz is better than it used to be.  Of course, the bar had been set pretty low.  The new owners seem to be genuinely concerned about running it right this time around.  The food is better (not hard to accomplish comparatively, but still an improvement), the service is average (which is still better than before), and the beer selection is improved.  Living nearby, it's great to finally have a local bar worth frequenting without feeling like I'm burning cash just to eat crud food and drink canned Guinness.   That said, they still can't seem to get french fries right.  After maybe five or so meals there with fries, they've ALWAYS been undercooked.  The beer selection is improved but mostly through the addition of bottles, and I've yet to see a good IPA there.  I would love to see some seasonal Schlafly on tap.

"I couldn't believe they screwed up cacio e pepe. The dish only has three ingredients: pecorino, black pepper corns (toasted and pestled into big pieces) and pasta. Their version used bucatini, which is fine. It was over cooked, not mushy, but way beyond al dente. That alone is inexcusable for a pasta dish. I couldn't detect any black pepper, maybe a little fine powder, but not the big chunks one would expect. Pepper is in the name of the dish, for crying out loud. Then I detected onion. There is no onion in cacio e pepe. Period. Finally the dish was way too salty. The beet salad was so so. It included a weird herbed goat cheese mousse that was fairly disgusting. The pears weren't yet ripe. I sent the pasta back. They brought out a gnocchi dish to appease me. That was bland and mushy and sitting in a pool of broth (my wife tried it, I didn't). I will give them credit for not charging us the full price of the meal, but I doubt we will ever return.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 2.0
"My fianc√© had been here once before with a friend, and he had mentioned that Nom Nom was pretty good and we should check it out together. Well, this weekend I suddenly got hungry while we were out, so we swung by Nom Nom to pick up a bowl of ramen to enjoy in the nice weather.  So first off, they only do take-out for regular size order, not large orders. Ah well, not a huge deal for us, but others might find that annoying. The menu is very small, but should accommodate everyone (unless you have a food allergy like celiac's). They have two different types of ramen (obvi one vegetarian) with your choice of the four different broths (shio/salt, shoyu/soy sauce, miso, and karai miso/spicy miso), additions you can add to your bowl, and two appetizers (pork buns and another item I can't remember) when we dropped by.   My fianc√© ordered the pork ramen in the karai broth, which was quite spicy but not too much so. The broth was definitely flavorful and tasty, and the ramen noodles were cooked well with still some bite to them. I wish there were more veggies in general, but I guess I'd have to order the vegetarian one to get that. The prices don't seem too bad when you see how large the bowls are, but god knows I always thought ramen was supposed to be Cheap with a capital 'c.' But otherwise Nom Nom provides a quick, tasty, cheap/affordable meal in an area where that's hard to find, unless you go to the super fast food chains.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"This restaurant is the closest one in walking distance that isn't directly inside the Gaylord Opryland. My party of city-folks were not excited by the name or the outside appearance... or even the taxidermy filled country inside, but boy was I. We waited 45 minutes on the patio, but with a huge country-style porch bench and lots of room, we managed to keep ourselves entertained. Once inside, we were one of two larger parties sat back inside this little 'cabin' of sorts. While it had some neat things inside of it, too, it did shield our view of some of the other happenings in the restaurant, which was unfortunate.  We ordered some gator bite appetizers which were totally awesome. This, in addition to these powdered-sugar covered 'corn nuggets.' Fair warning-- these were not corn kernels fried in a savory matter. It was more like cornmeal dough with powdered sugar. I wasn't a fan.   You could get 2-3 huge catfish filets (blackened, fried, or grilled) for less than $14. I settled on 2 with some fried okra, and my gosh was it delicious. Everyone in our party loved their food, even if it was way too much for us to eat in one night, and the rooms at the Gaylord Opryland don't have refrigerators.   There was also a bluegrass band playing that night with some hardcore knee-slappin', feel good music. I totally dig this place. I'd go back in a heartbeat.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 5.0

"I am extremely disappointed and livid about this establishment. My wife and I left Boise and went to Reno for a mini vacation and she was showing me around where she grew up. We decided to go here for a little night of fun, we got there at 8pm and had 2 hours before they closed. We ended up buying the ""Pick 3"" deal for both me and her so we spent around $60 plus a tip. The guy at the counter was the best thing we had for the night. He did an awesome Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck impression so I hope all of my tip went to him but I'm sure it didn't. I also learned to never tip first before you know the kind of service you're going to get. We first decided to do the Pirate mini golf but then had issues with our cards not working for us to start it. I went back to him and he gave me and my wife some wristbands to get started and checked the card to make sure it worked. We went back and it didn't even work still. We ended up taking two golf balls that some people left on the counter when they finished but we only got to Hole 5 and had to leave because we had a huge group in front of us. No worries, that stuff happens. So we decided to go bowling. It was around 8:30 when we approached the counter to play but then they told us they couldn't let us play because they didn't have any lanes open. Well then why in the world when we looked around there were some spots open? If it's for Covid, sure I understand, if it's because it's an hour and a half before closing that's a load of crap. With the Pick 3 deal we paid for it only allowed us to play one game. Me and my wife are pretty fast at bowling so it wouldn't take us an hour and a half to bowl. So we went to go try our hand at winning tickets at the arcade games (which they give you 20 tokens for one card.) We went to the ticket grabbers where the claw grabs a roll of tickets. The first game my wife immediately won a roll of 500 tickets. When it dropped the tickets and scooted them in the dropbox we couldn't grab them because the door was shut and it had a sticker saying ""All tickets won are applied to the card"". So that meant our tickets were on the card right? Wrong. After we were done we went to turn in our card to get our tickets the stupid machine didn't even register that we won 500 tickets. What happened to just simply giving out tickets when you win? The guy at the counter said they couldn't do anything about it so all he could do was refund our credits. It was only 5 credits. Wow that's amazing. How about I get a refund for the $60 I spent on just getting ripped off? When me and my wife decided to leave after that I was going to talk to a manager to figure out if there was anything we could do if we ever decided to come back, but I couldn't find anyone to talk to. I definitely will not be coming back here and my wife being a native to Reno and going there all the time when she lived there mentioned how it's changed.",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 2.0

Last time I went and ordered takeaway food and a milkshake and it took almost 30min, they got mixed up with their tickets and made my shake latter than everyone behind me.

"The Please Touch Museum is amazing. We are lucky to live a convenient 15 minutes away, and, since getting a membership, go at least once (and sometimes more) a week. Every display and activity is interesting and it is big enough that you don't have the same experience every time.  My toddler loves it, and wakes up asking to go to ""Touch.   A few Tips: 1. If you can, go during the week. We have been there after nap and it is empty. The weekend can get very, very crowded, and, if you have little ones, it can feel a little scary with lots of older kids running around without looking.  2. If you do go on a weekend, the earlier the better. It's VERY clean first thing in the morning.  2. Get a membership. The basic level is $150/year, and includes parking and entrance for 4 people. It also includes discounts. If you don't have a membership, park on the street for free.  3. Check the daily calendar. It's posted in the entrance and in other areas. We've really enjoyed some surprise activities.   4. Bring food and drink. There are lots of tables and quiet areas for snacking. There are also restrooms everywhere (major plus), including several family restrooms.",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 5.0

Highlight was one of their pizza specials, BBQ Chicken, which was incredible. BBQ sauce, mozzarella, chicken, pineapple, onion, blue cheese, and jalapenos. Oh my, incredible. Unique pizza flavor.

The oil is ""lighter"" or ""cleaner"" tasting. Sometimes you go to a fried chicken place and you can tell the grease was on its second or third cycle.  Crunch factor: 5/5! My hubby and I did the overnight test. It remains crunchy even after the next day.  Flavor: honey garlic is 4/5...nice flavor but nothing unexpectedly amazing, but its fried chicken so you'll keep eating.  unfortunately the honey butter is 2/5.  You can smell a slight hint of butter and honey but it is neither sweet or buttery when you taste it. It's like when you drink la croix water, you imagine the flavors but it doesnt quite hit your tongue.

"Cure has been everything to me in New Orleans.  Remember that New Orleans has Happy Hour even on the weekends, so some cocktails at Cure are $6 from 5 - 7.  You can get apps such as homemade pimento cheese for $5 and a cheese and charcuterie plate for $11. I usually get the cheese plate and request only cheese. It comes with nuts and amazingly toasted bread. Normally happy hour cheese spreads can be stingy but Cure's isn't.   For a place so known for its drinks, I can't stop talking about the food. The smoked trout dip with saltines is so amazing that I've ordered two orders before. It's perfectly balanced and will give you a craving forever. The meatballs come in tomato sauce with a spicy and wholesome flavor. The pimento cheese dip is savory and thick. I personally am a huge fan of the deviled eggs.   As for drinks, always try the daily punch. They switch it up every day. Yesterday's was a take off a Paloma with grapefruit. It was refreshing and tasty. After I try the punch, I usually stick with the happy hour daiquiri. I don't really order daiquiris anywhere else but this one is just priceless. It's all citrus with just the right amount of pulp.

"Great lunch specials!  When I called I found out they don't make reservations for less than five people. Since we had four we didn't make the cut. I asked them how busy it would be at noon on a Friday. I've never seen a business in Tampa Bay be on a wait during lunch during the week (anyone know of any?) The person on the phone went around and asked and said it was hit or miss whether there would be a wait. This freaked out my neuroticism a bit because I don't like waiting for a table especially when I'm with a group (anything more than myself is a group). I decided I would chance it. I'm not sure if it was just the Friday I went, but they were far from busy. I would say about half the restaurant was full. Basically, don't be concerned if you are going during a weekday for lunch.   That huge tangent aside, the menu looks pretty cool. They even have sushi burritos! As another Yelper mentioned, they should update their website because they have more options than what is up there (like the sushi burrito). Their lunch menu is correct though. I went with the Shrimp ""Udon"". As Kristi S. mentioned it isn't your normal udon in broth. It's udon noodles on a plate. It was basically shrimp and noodles - my husband would love it. I though it was pretty good, but next time I want to try their two roll lunch special. The rolls are quite large!

"Positives: SMOKE FREE sports bar...a rarity in this city. They make every attempt to source their ingredients locally...very impressive for an operation of this size. Menu truly has something for everyone (many vegetarian choices), with a portion of the menu dedicated specifically to Gluten Free offerings. Half-price appetizers after a certain time. Tons of TVs. HUGE patio with great fire pit and couches. Dyson Airblade hand dryers. I love them. Usually the servers are knowledgeable and pleasant. Your food's always hot because it's brought out when it's ready by a runner. The manager with Polamalu-esque hair is very involved and super nice. Fresh flowers on all the tables-nice little surprise. Mini Corndogs. Handful of local beers available. Big booths seat 6 people. Kid-friendly. This Indiana-only mini chain TRIES and it's evident.   Negatives: it's the first floor of a high rise-you'll likely need to park in a garage or walk a few blocks from a spot on the street. It can be LOUD...not just a little...especially on the weekends. Sometimes there's a bad douchebag vibe. Every now and then you'll get a crappy server...there are dozens of servers, bound to be a few lemons. Tons of TVs, even at the tables. Sometimes you're just not in the mood for whatever's on at your table. Sometimes drinks take quite awhile to arrive. Giant menu can overwhelm, but think about what you are in the mood for, and use the table of contents to guide you. Or just build your own sandwich back on page 20-something. On nights when there are ""significant"" sports events, wait can be long, and they don't take reservations...but there is a very nice waiting area with wing-back chairs.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"This review is for food only, not the music, ambiance, or service.  We were kind of pressed for time before a concert at the Ryman and needed a place serving something (anything) vegetarian.  To their credit they served a veggieburger, which is surprisingly not easy to find in the area.  At best it was ok, as were the somewhat soggy fries.  The three stars reflect our server, who was really nice and helpful, the music, and the rustic ambiance which we appreciated.  If you are vegetarian there are numerous really good options in Nashville, unfortunately not in the downtown area.

"As a former Rogers customer, where I had a crappier plan that cost more money and didn't even provide cell reception in my own apartment, the bar to really impress me in providing mobile service is pretty low. Wind still has managed to fail to do so.  In theory I really like some of the ways they do things differently from Rogers and Telus, with the supposed ""pay in advance, avoid hidden fees"" model and cheaper but better plans at the expense of coverage being mostly limited to major urban centres.  In practice, my experience with Wind thus far has been marred by incompetence and annoyances:  -Wind sends me text messages that are contradictory, confusing and irritating. Immediately after signing up I was bombarded with several conflicting texts about me making a payment, my service being activated, me owing a balance, and my service being temporarily disabled due to non-payment. I got them after I had left the store and went a few blocks, and I had to go back to clarify with the rep what was going on. He explained the automated system sent them out of order.  More recently I paid my bill, received a text indicating I had, then seconds later received a text indicating that my subscription couldn't be renewed because my balance was too low. I placed outbound calls and received inbound texts in spite of this. Internet/data didn't work. Nothing about it made any sense.  -Internet/data not working upon monthly renewal period, in spite of me paying my bills...obviously in itself a problem and something I'll need to place yet another call to them to get sorted.  -When I signed up, I indicated to the rep who set me up that I wanted to be set up for recurring payments in advance, and he provided paperwork for me to fill out accordingly. Come the first due date, the payment was made, but my service was still discontinued and I was notified that I owed a balance. I had to call to get it sorted, and apparently the rep did not take a 44 cent 911 fee into account in the amount he set my recurring payments for. The different rep on the phone blamed me for ""not authorizing the full amount"" and indicated that for some reason I needed to make a new payment for the full amount of my monthly bill and the surplus would go towards my balance.  So not only was this ridiculously incompetent on their part, a waste of my time, and annoying, but if I was cash strapped at the time it would have really sucked to have to put up two months bills at once due to their screw up.  -$38 in surplus balance disappeared. In spite of ""Billing Details"" and ""Usage"" tabs in my account online, it was surprisingly frustrating and convoluted to find out what I was charged for. It was not readily displayed in either tab and in the end I found it somewhere that would be quite obscure unless one already knew what the charge was for.  These guys have a good concept but they are clowns.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 1.0

"Great idea in theory, but horrible execution. First off, their process for game reservations is totally flawed. We gave our names at the front and said ""we will play anything"" and was told the soonest we could play something was 3 hours, and that we could play giant jenga for free in the meantime. Took a lap around, and there was 2 sets of giant jenga in the entire place.   After a few hours we got to play patio pong, and it was only for 30 minutes. Went back up after and asked where we were on the waitlist for everything else and she said since we played the one game and the rep at the front before didn't make us separate queues before, we were not on any list anymore. Horrible system, not sure why the reps error was our fault.   Beyond that, all their cocktails were super fruity. We had to return two of them and exchange them for something else. Cocktails are $12.50 with tax and before tip so expect to pay around 15-16$ per cocktail and for every game you have to play. They didn't have quarters either they said they were all out.

"Very good food.  Surprisingly, it was exactly what I expected.  I was expecting a diner food / comfort food take on classic Italian and Mexican dishes and that's exactly what I got.  If you're looking for authentic, this might not be the place to go, but authenticity is only sacrificed for comfort and flavor.  I tried the fish tacos and my wife had the chicken fajitas.  We also shared an order of queso loco dip with chips.  Though the queso claims to be made with queso blanco, the cheese was yellow.  It tasted more like a mild cheddar cheese gravy with rotel and that's not a bad thing.  The fish tacos had great seasoning and although the shells were greasy, it was very good.  The chicken fajitas surprised us because of yellow peppers instead of the red we're used to.  We normally don't like yellow peppers because they are more bitter, but it was just the right flavor to go with the chicken.  Overall, it was a good experience.  And having Jarritos (especially tamarind) is a great touch.  The dining area is still a bit noisy with its bare walls, despite much effort with the sound dampening panels, but not nearly as bad as other places in Edwardsville (We're looking at you, Cleveland-Heath).  The walls are lined with electric outlets just above eye level, but they all have covers on the ports.  I think they're missing a great opportunity for the business lunch crowd.  A few cents of electricity right at the table is a great draw for those with laptops.  I'll be coming back and trying the italian side of things - especially their Italian Beef.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"We split some dolmas, and ordered 1 chicken kebab and an Iraqi sandwich (with fries.) The kebab was ground chicken, and it was incredibly moist and well-seasoned throughout. The accompanying rice was also delicious--usually I feel Middle Eastern rice sides are an afterthought, but I loved this one. The French fries were perfect, and the small sides of homos and Iraqi salad/pickles we had with both entrees were fresh and tasty. My partner loved the dolmas, which are his favorite appetizer, and he finished his sandwich, although he said the sauce on it was a little sweet, and not what he had expected. I often come away disappointed from Middle Eastern and Mediterranean joints due to underseasoning or dry meat, so this dinner far exceeded my expectations. We ended up snagging some baklava to take home, and it was among the best I've had--tender and beautifully textured, with a hint of spice.

"If you'd like to be treated like a second class citizen this is your pool company!!!! If I could give negative stars this would be the place I'd leave them. Never in my life have I ever experienced such TERRIBLE service. My husband and I have used RIVERTON for years only to see a wonderful company go down the tubes. If you enjoy wasting your time, being lied to and charged for services not rendered then you've found the perfect pool company. We've tried making an appointment for well over a month and a half only to be disregarded and charged. We were both promised call backs from probably every single employee in this establishment, and two months later I'm still waiting. It's absurd, I feel like I'm being pranked somehow. You're a pool company with customers begging you to service our pool. What kind of business are you?? Had you actually serviced our pool per the contract we had when opening you would have known what was wrong with it. A minor tear in our filter. But it's ok, my handy husband and I figured it out after days of trouble shooting it. We've certainly moved all our business to another company and am EMBARRASSED to admit how many friends I referred to them...

My wife does coupons, and she came across a website that does coupons for restaurant. La Fruente had their coupon there and we bought it only to find out that they would not honor their own coupon for the rest of the year. I would understand if it was a temporary promotion, or if the gift card I now have expired, but it has no expiration date, they will just not accept it anymore. If they had removed the ability for me to buy this item from them this would not have been an issue for me; however when you issue something from your restaurant that you wont honor I no longer want to do business with you.

"Jose the store manager embodies the old saying, ""We are the phone company and we don't care.""  I went to the store to transfer a plan from another customer to my phone.  We followed the instructions on the web and I verified by calling 611 to ensure we were doing it correctly before we went to the store.  The other customer and I walked up to the counter and explained what we were doing to the Verizon employee.  She acted like she could not understand what in the world we were talking about.  She called in the ""brains"" of their operation--Jose.  He told us we could not do what we had already arranged to do.  He laughed at us and he told the other customer he would annotate his account to make sure he could never transfer his account through another store.  The other customer got so angry and frustrated hat he just cancelled his plan right there.  Jose kept laughing!  I will go to another carrier as well as I won't tolerate this kind of treatment.

Then told us we could be seated but would have to leave at 1:00 PM.  Seated us at bar. Front desk is in a daze.   Perhaps the nose rings are interfering with their brain waves? Bar tender too busy to cater to  customers at bar because he is servicing bar and restaurant waiters/customers. Watched 5 tables sit idle  Girls at front desk and manager are NOT customer focused. When asked why so many empty tables and couldn't we be seated at one, girl at front desk was LOUD while explaining that, ""we take reservations you know"". We asked for manager who explained his troubles that day. Servers called in sick therefore a dining room could not be opened. Interesting concept, however food is way overpriced, and the requisite customer service is missing.  Brochure lists wrong (much lower)  pricing for admission than what you pay at gate.

"Its not everyday I give a business 5 stars! The location is perfect because its central to everyone living in St. Petersburg. The selection is great and the prices range from low to high, truly something for every budget. We flip houses on the side and have sold 6 homes last year alone, much of the work done came from this store! Our last flip was a 100 year old Spanish style house on Part Street, Floor & D√©cor even stocks Spanish tiles, the previous owner had the entire house done in pink tile? So it was a major project and all the tile came from here to restore back to its original glory. Now we are restoring another older home and we are approx. 85% finished after only two months of non stop each day of work since moving in, we have never gotten this far on a project this quick and the quality is outstanding, leaves everyone speechless who have seen it, they all ask where we found the backsplash tiles and we tell everyone Floor & D√©cor, I have sent well over a dozen friends to this location and they have all bought things here too. We hope to flip a few more houses this year and it would not look 1/2 this good if not for this store, I truly believe that because the other places around town such as Lowe's and Home Depot do not carry the exotics that I gravitate towards, the difference when selling a house and buying cheap tile and high end tiles is night and day, the more expensive not only looks better, but you get way more out of it after its finished! You can pay $2 bucks per sq. ft. for a custom backsplash tile for your kitchen or pay $30 per sq. ft., trust me when you go to sell you will get every cent back and then some, but when you use the cheapo stuff you will maybe break even, people can tell quality and expect it now a days, especially in this pricy area.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 5.0

"A bunch of us decided to spend Sunday at Longwood while the weather was still nice. None of us had dined here before and I guess we expected a lot more from this restaurant. The park is gorgeous and the dining room is very well appointed. Our server was attentive and quite personable however the food was a little underwhelming.  For the good: We started with a cheese plate, which we all enjoyed. Cheese was delicious and the paired nuts and dried fruit complemented well. Some of us ordered Bloody Marys and those were tasty as well. And now the bad: Three of the six in our party ordered the burger for Sunday brunch. All three mentioned that the meat was dry and flavorless. One person ordered the ""fluffy"" pancakes and the pancakes were not really fluffy and again, he said that the whole dish was bland. Another ordered the biscuits and gravy, she was not pleased with the huge chunks of meat in the gravy. I had the summer salad and mushroom soup. The dressing was light but I wished they had more of their heirloom vegetables that they so proudly displayed. My soup was ok, I frankly have had better mushroom soup from a pub in Kenneth square. For dessert we couldn't resist ordering the flowerpot. It was beautiful. Looked exactly like a flower pot. The whole dessert was just bland. The mousse needed more sugar, the pot was just pure buttercream which needed more sweet, it basically tasted like butter. The best part of the dessert was the ""dirt"" made of crushed up cookies.

"This is BY FAR, the most terrible grocery store I have ever been to.    I move to New Orleans March 1st and the first day I went to 4 different grocery stores to try and figure out where I was going to do my shopping.  Rouses was suggested to me by several people who said it was inexpensive and good quality so I did half of my shopping at Whole Foods and half at Rouses.   Several of the products that I bought on March 1st were expired.  Some had expired in February (okay- not too far off), but wait- some expired in NOVEMBER 2010 (ridiculous!).    I decided to give Rouses one last chance yesterday- knowing that I would be checking dates on everything I bought, I went back nonetheless to grab a few things.  I ended up purchasing some fresh gulf tuna- which I ended up getting Histamine poisoning from last night.  I've been buying tuna for years at my local grocery store in Austin and have NEVER had an adverse reaction as such.   I come from Austin, where we must be spoiled rotten by HEB (a business that I suggest Rouses should try to model themselves after)  Not only do they have the freshest meats and vegetables- their prices are about half of that here.

"I stayed in a ""king size bed"" room on the third floor. The room itself was nice in my opinion not bad at all. It was actually clean, seemed well taken care of. There was 1 bath towel, a few hand towels also a place to hang your clothes with hangers. The bathroom had body soap, bar hand soap, bar face soap, conditioning shampoo. They had all your basic stuff with small but useful little features here and there. There were these fancy reading lights above each side of the bed, also on each side there was a dresser with a drawer and storage with 3 plug in outlets on the front of it also 2 usb slots to charge your phone. You really get what you pay for at this hotel. On the downside you can tell the building is a little old and the amenities here are very minimal. There is a pool but it's very small. There was a washer and dryer in a room downstairs but the dryer was out of order, bummer lol. The WORST part of this hotel is there was no damn water... they had ice machines, but NO WATER... I had to walk next door a few times to Bob Evans to get some. luckily they were nice and did not charge me for cups of water to go. The BEST part of this hotel is the STAFF. They had no problem making me a new key to get in my room every time I lost it and they were patient and polite in the process. When I left for the day I came back in just 3 hours and my room was already COMPLETELY CLEAN, my sink was cleaned out, toilet cleaned, dresser wiped off, my stuff was just where I left it with the exception of my clothes that were on the bed were hung up while my bed was made! That really impressed me. Also a special thank you and shout out to Miss Ronda at the front desk. Last night I lost $10 and couldn't find it when I woke up. Went on throughout my day with the loss slightly bummed out but no big deal right? At around 11pm or midnight I was coming back into my room and I forgot my key in the room... Mind you, I had to get my key remade 3 TIMES  and Miss ronda greeted me by name and returned my $10 I had lost the night before! This really made my day, so big thank you for your awesome integrity and good heart Ronda  This was my first time going to Brandon Florida, I love this state and city so far every person I have ran into at this hotel and all around have been very nice, genuine, and inviting. This was a good experience. Thank you for your time reading and thank you to the Red Roof in Brandon, Florida.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 4.0
"I was excited to try a new Tex-mex/taco place in town but I was severely disappointed with my experience.  Upon first glance, the place reminded me a lot of another taco place in Sylvan Park that has been around a lot longer, called the Local Taco--it had the same styled concept and the same color scheme. When I looked at the menu, the taco options were practically identical to what I could find at Local Taco (down to the jalapeno coleslaw on the and the lime mayo on the fried chicken). No big deal, I figured maybe this place could do it as well or better than the Local Taco and was excited to try. However, it turned out they were nowhere near as good as TLC.  The bad: I purchased a brisket, a fried chicken and a carnitas taco, along with guacamole and chips on the side. My husband tried two of the same but instead of the brisket, he purchased the Memphis taco. Both of us commented on how extremely dry and bland the chicken was. The sparse amount of mayo couldn't add flavor or juiciness where there just absolutely was none. It was so poorly seasoned I had to add salt and pepper to the taco, something I've never put on a taco before in my life. We also both agreed that the carnitas taco was extremely dry and NOT what carnitas should be at all. There was some kind of sauce on this taco, which I had maybe a 1/4 of what my husband had on his, but even the sauce couldn't salvage this extremely dry and flavorless meat. My brisket taco was the only item that was tender in the entire meal--and it had flavor, but too much flavor, it was WAY too salty for me to really enjoy it.  The Memphis taco was again, dry and without any flavor (even the jalapeno coleslaw didn't add any flavor to it). It seemed that the toppings on the tacos were there to attempt to salvage the lackluster protein but even they couldn't manage that.  The good: The guacamole was delicious although I could do without the stray jalapeno (singular, one slice of jalapeno) in the dish. i don't know why places think jalapeno has a proper place in guacamole, but to each their own. The margaritas were also good, and the mix was not too sweet.  I truly walked away feeling very ""Meh"" about my experience here. I won't be wasting my money here to give them a second chance, instead I'll be going to the tried and true Local Taco where I can find the same dining options but prepared well and with flavor.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Ok so I've been craving wings for some time now. We've only gone out for dinner 2 or 3 times in the last year due to covid. Last time at the Owl place of Princeton it was just too expensive so I wasn't going back there and more recently I stopped in at BWW  but had to walked out after finishing 1 beer. I've even tried a few buffalo chicken cheese stakes that were good but just didn't satisfy the craving. Flash to today I was looking forward to our reservation at JOJO's like laying in bed wide eyed on Christmas eve, but when we sat down we learned their kitchen was down, so no wings yet again. Going through our options while pulling out of the parking lot, my wife pulls up First and Ten, Yeah I know of them but have never been. Then she reads a few reviews about the ""best wings"" in the area.  Ok then let's do it. Pulling in, to be honest my expectations were not very high, Its a bit of a dive from the outside and the inside did not sway my first impressions much. But luckily I rarely base everything on first impressions and was in a mood for the adventure. Hands down this was a great happy accident. I for one applaud professionally friendly service and good comfort food above all else and First & Ten Sports Pub is all that in spades. Three servers were working the floor, stopping by with perfect timing and assistance. They even split our meal order on to two plates without having to ask. For starters we ordered the doze wings mild with a side of Hot for me, which was just the right kick for wings. OMG from the first bite I was just so pleased and by the last I was cured. I even wondered if I'd take home a dozen for later - (will power i did not). I'll just have to come back to try another style. Then we also split the French Dip. Another great choice, sharing this left us perfectly full without being stuffed. The only negatives would be its a bit pricy (effects of covid economy) and the cheep napkins but they know that and hope to get something better soon. Over all I couldn't be more satisfied. Thanks for a great experience !!",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 5.0

"Upon entering for To go service. The menu was confusing and that was with asking questions to order. After more then Half an hour figuring out what you can and can not order. Then when ordering had to spend $55 for 2 family dinners but had to order 2 just to buy it. That means 4 dinners. When getting home there where only 2 dinners, with over cook meat and small sized portions. When referring to the store manager,via phone to confirm our order he gave excuse after excuse. So after a few minutes of trying to clarify all this he decides just to do a refund to avoid issues.

"I have tried to like this place. I love the decor. And the drinks look good. Those alone deserve the stars.   But the food just isn't great. Especially for the price. In the few times I've been there I've had the squash soup, Mac and cheese, giant pork chop, and the breakfast power bowl. My boyfriends had the shrimp cocktail, Brussels sprout salad, and the steak. The descriptions on the menu are wonderful, they just don't translate well when the food comes out.   I've been in for lunch. Started with the shrimp cocktail, which was actually quite good. (Sadly it was off the menu last time I checked) The Mac and cheese was over cooked and the noodles had that super soggy, mushy consistency. My boyfriend had the Brussels sprout salad. It was okay. But quite small.   I went in for dinner. The squash soup was served scalding hot. The pork chop was enormous, which was expected, but it was dry. My boyfriend had the steak and he said it was wonderful. It was smothered in a reduction. This was his favorite part. Wish I would have ordered that.   This morning was my least favorite visit. I stopped in with my boyfriend. We both had the power bowl. It came with a couple eggs and served over a salad with veggies. The salad was okay.  The veggies were not. They didn't really have a specific seasoning. One of them was romenesco. Which is tricky to begin with. There were also mushrooms and what looked like peppers. They were all overly oily and not very flavorful.   This really is my own fault. I keep going back expecting something different. I do admire the chef for trying though. Perhaps after a long while I'll come back. But as for right now some work still needs to be done.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

It's not that difficult to say ""hey guys how's it going, as a reminder masks are required when up from the table"" get some manners you're in customer service or quit your job.

"In New Orleans, there are scores of small spots scattered around the city that serve wonderfully inventive food. Years ago ( we're old, many years ago) they were primarily located in the Quarter. They moved out to the CBD and Warehouse District and now Magazine Street houses a variety of exciting spots where eclectic NOLA based food reigns. Coquette is an exemplar in that fraternity.  This was a special place with excellent food.   We started with the Gulf Shrimp, nice sized and sitting in a snappy horseradish based remoulade. My wife enjoyed the Gulf Seafood Stew. I had the butter soft and oh, so flavorful Short Ribs. Sitting a splash of green mole and topped with pumpkin seeds, this was a special treat. I don't often order beef. If more was like this that would not be the case. We ordered the Basil semifreddo because it seemed the most inventive and it was.

We had not seen each other in weeks, shared all the dishes and had the exact same symptoms from 5 to 8 hours after eating and yet the restaurant, when I sent them a very nice private message letting them know that there may have been a prep issue at one of their stations that night, tried to tell me that it was unlikely to have been caused by our meal as most food borne illnesses are between 24 to 48 hours. I'm assuming they are not intelligent enough to know that one of the most common causes of food borne illnesses, Salmonella, can cause the symptoms we had within 4 hours.   I wasn't at all annoyed at them for being sick, because these things happen. However, such an unintelligent response forced me to write this bad review.

The room itself was ok, but the shower was for people that are 5 feet tall or less, basically we had to sit down to wash our hair, it was comical. I will say the bed was comfortable, but the view was nothing. I don't think the hotel was booked, and for the customer service rep to do so little in trying to make a stay better, I am suprised.

It's a frozen chicken patty, covered in hot sauce and I think brown sugar or something gritty on a piece of thick white bread.  The slaw they serve with it smelled like tainted mayo.  It was horrible.    Now this is in Nashville, the home of Hot Chicken.  Maybe we were wrong ordering hot chicken at Logan's when Hattie B's is just down the block.

"My wife & I have been looking forward to going to the classiest steakhouse in Reno since moving here just a couple of years ago. Most of our experience was really nice, room was clean & nicely appointed. The service was top notch, Stephen was our Captain that night and he was everything we had hoped for, friendly, very engaging & personable. Unfortunately our only qualm was with the food quality? Wow, talk about falling flat on your face, I was aware that Harrah's was going to be closing soon but this quality was unacceptable. I ordered the Prime Grade New York, let me say PRIME GRADE, $$$; I easily could have bought a select grade steak at Safeway and  it would have been better. Prime is a grade of quality I don't mind paying for as it was a special occasion but this steak had a huge fat strap running along the top and had unpleasant, tough, veins running through the steak. The only reason we didn't return it was how impressed we  were with Stephen and his crew. My wife had a very fatty rib eye, we realize the beauty of the rib eye is its fat/flavor content but this was beyond acceptable.

"This is one of the few hotels I'd come back to.  Not only for its location (which is superb), but also for the quality of its staff and rooms.  There was only 1 out of 20 staff members I've bumped into that I didn't like.  Everyone else was sooooooooooooooo helpful and unpretentious!  The gentlemen outside are very quick to hail a cab for you; usually there's a couple cabs waiting across the street.  A king bed is the same price as doubles, so I went for the king.  OMG, it came with ~9 pillows.  I didn't use anymore than one, but they're there if I need them!  The colors in the room were quite classy, but not overly fancy.  Nice headboard, bed linens, etc.  The TV is flat panel and pretty big.  There's a small water heater if you want coffee/tea.  There's a huge comfy chair in the room as well as a pretty big desk.  I have a very nice view of the cityscape from the 11th floor.  There's a nice balcony/patio area on the 4th floor by the pool, also with a nice view.  Upon exit of the hotel, there is an even more spectacular view.  Follow the steps down, and there's a nice walkway along the water.  Lots of trees, nice boats, etc.  It's quite relaxing to walk/sit out there at the end of the day.  On the opposite side of the hotel, you can follow Dock St. to reach 2nd St x Chestnut to find good food/bars.  -1 star (and I'm being a little picky here) for: -The pool was a bit smelly (not the usual chlorine smell).  It's so dark in the water that you can't tell if you're swimming straight. -No robes provided. -Room keys don't always work in the elevators (yes, they are required to get to some floors) -Weird access to parking garage. -Towels like to shed, so I'd keep getting cotton in my eyes. -My water heater had weird residue coming out of it. -Vending machine on my floor never had bottled water.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 4.0

"ALERT THE CDC On a fairly busy Saturday afternoon the bartender was hustling. She mixed drinks,washed glasses,handled,cards and cash,refilled the cooler with ice from a large container that she picked up off the floor-from the bottom, she filled quart size containers of olives from a gallon jug by using her bare hand and poured the olive juice into each container while letting the olive juice run over her hand.

"Boy have things changed since my last review in which I gave Bistro 7 a four-star review. Came in near the end of happy hour and had a seat at the bar. Had to wait a bit until someone noticed us even though a server was literally two feet away from us. He was making a drink, but a simple, 'we'll be with you in a second' would have been nice. Another bartender noticed us and happily gave us a menu and he did come back to take our order promptly. We thought, okay, just a minor burp, but they're back on top of things.  The food that came back, clams and a brie potsticker, were about as bland as is possible. The pour on the wines was kind of skimpy compared to other places, but hey, it was happy hour. This was way different from the times in the past which is sad as the decor and the ambience is fantastic.  What bothered me the most was after we finished our wines, and our food, the server never looked at us again. Never asked us if we wanted another drink or something else. He talked to a couple who I assume were regulars for about ten minutes. We had to get the attention of someone else to get us our check as we just wanted to get out and spend our money elsewhere. If you want to expand your customer base, how about taking care of new customers and not just the regulars.  Will certainly not be coming back in the future. Crossed Bistro 7 off of our list of places to dine and have a glass of wine.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Stopped by ChopHouse Grille on Friday night for appetizers and drinks.  Pros: Beautiful atmosphere. They've really done a nice job with the interior. Outdoor bar with fire pit. Modern and elegant, but not stuffy. Service: We sat at the indoor bar. Our bartender, Tim, was great. Attentive and made nice recommendations. The GM stopped by during our meal and asked us if everything was okay. The staff work together as a team and food came out of the kitchen very quickly on a busy Friday night.  Cocktails/drinks: Creative and delicious. Thyme lemonade ($11) was tart and earthy/herbal. Irish mocha cold brew ($9) was like having a chocolate martini but only better. I like how they use their cold brew coffee in cocktails. They have good local beers on tap.  Cons: This place is expensive! Drink prices are reasonable, but value for food is not.  Food: Found the food to just only be okay. The kona filet tips ($17) were decent, but only a few pieces of meat and mostly the dish was made up of mushrooms. The crispy Brussels sprouts ($13) again were okay, chili sauce was pretty good, but not worth the price. Buffalo shrimp ($16) was your standard fare, nice with chunky blue cheese - but the shrimp seemed like they were sitting around for awhile because they were somewhat cold and soggy. 5 shrimp, standard size, for $16. Whipped ricotta ($12) was a nice option for dessert - because the ChopHouse does not offer a ""real"" dessert menu. Just dessert ""shooters"" for $3. This is always a good idea if you want to just have a small sweet treat after dinner - but ChopHouse would not be a good place to stop by if you were looking for dessert and and a cocktail.  The place is new so certainly they are still working on their operations. ChopHouse is owned by the fine folks at The Pour House and PJ Whelihan's, so they are good restauranteurs and will figure it out. The food coming out of the kitchen looked really good and maybe we just ordered wrong. Go check out the place for yourself and if the weather is good sit at the outdoor bar area.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0
"I was in town for 4 nights for work.  This hotel was close to our training site, which was our main reason for selecting it.  I thought it would be fine since it's part of the Marriott family.  I should have guessed that you get what you pay for.  Positives: Really positive/kind/helpful staff; free ICE! tickets; shuttle to Opryland and Opry Mills; quiet; ease on and off of Briley  Negatives: REALLY uncomfortable beds; almost no blankets to speak of; no continental breakfast; overwhelming chlorine smell because the pool is in the middle of the hotel; pretty crappy shampoo/conditioner/body wash; inconsistent Wifi connectability; sticky bathroom door latch (I almost got stuck a few times!!)  Oddities: Free Christmas present wrapping station (huh?); light switch positions (you'll see what I mean...particularly in the bathroom area); VERY small bathroom (as in, you can hardly close the door); strange smell in the hotel room itself  I don't think I'd stay here again.

"We stayed one night in the Blue Heron room while en route from NYC to parts more remote. The inn can be a little confusing to find in the dark; just ask for clear directions and use GPS. The room was clean and decently appointed; the surrounding countryside (what we saw of it) was beautiful. Staff were pleasant and helpful with directions, etc. One word of warning: on our way out, we bought firewood from the ""farm"" across the busy road, expecting to use the wood on our next, even more rustic, stop. THE FIREWOOD TURNED OUT TO BE GREEN AND WET AND SEEMED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF NOXIOUS CHEMICAL IN IT. THEY HAD CLAIMED THE WOOD WAS READY TO BURN; INSTEAD, THEY ARE SELLING BAD WOOD. SO MY ONE WORD OF ADVICE IS: DON'T BUY WOOD FROM THE PLACE ACROSS THE ROAD! That place seemed to be named ""Gravity Hill Farm,"" but I'm not positive that was its name. Clearly, this has nothing to do with Pineapple Hill Bed and Breakfast, which is a lovely establishment. Just a warning to other visitors.

"Well, this review was a long time coming. I have been a barbecue snob of sorts in the last decade or so. I am used to home cooked BBQ that has a family zing and a hometown feel. I have tried the gambit of St. Louis and KC BBQ. I steered clear of Bandana's, Super Smokers and other large ""chain style"" entities. I may have been too hasty with my choices. Prepare for another Allen Good/Bad List.  Good 1. The staff was friendly. 2. The restaurant was clean and tidy. 3. The food choices were pretty expanse for a BBQ place. 4. The food showed up quickly. 5. The smoked rope sausage was simply delicious. I enjoyed every bite. 6. They garlic breads was LITERALLY the best I have ever had.  Bad 1. The sauces were not quite the special sauce of deliciousness I expected, but still very passable, and unlimited. 2. The okra was delicious, but seemed like something from Sysco.

I ordered through uber eats my issue was there was NO eel sauce on our vegas rolls after waiting an hour for our family's food. There also appeared to be no teriyaki sauce on my daughter's chicken teriyaki bowl. I called to complain that there was no sauce on our food the hostess argued with me that she was positive that it was on there or maybe they just put a small amount.

"The shaded outdoor patio is my fav. spot because I love the fresh air, taking in the sights around me (lots of foot traffic & people watching to do) & fans to try to keep cool, but you know the best way to keep cool is with a cocktail (:-D), which was better compared to their PINOT GRIGIO (3/5).  CHICKEN PICATTA (4/5): I looove artichoke hearts - def. a great addition with a good cut of chicken that wasn't tough at all and portioned out for one person with broccoli, red onions & squash; it was a small side of delish veggies that I really wish was a larger serving!  GUACAMOLE STUFFED ONION RINGS (4.5/5): Unique with light garlic aioli, so I'd ask for more in the future and topped with young pea tendrils & vey picturesque with an orchid! The only thing I didn't like was the room temperature onion rings, wanted it hot.  The SERVICE (3.5/5): I would've liked to have been checked on besides just taking our order and delivering our meals...service needs a little more work tbh & this also happened previously when my hubs & I got a bottle of wine to share.

"I finally made my way to this fine estabilishment and somehow dodged having  a heart attack and being rolled out of the place after the fatty goodness I consumed. We decided to go around lunch time since the few attempts we made in the past left us with an hour or longer wait. There was a small wait but they take your phone number and call you when they're ready. Once inside, I realized why there is always a wait, besides the food being phenom, the place is rather small with a bar and 6 or 7 small tables.  To start, we had the short rib cheddar fries- Worth every single calorie!!! The short ribs were so tender and the cheddar concoction was so good.  The burgers- by far the best we've had to date. I played it safe with just having cheddar and carmelized onions on mine- the onions were cooked to perfection and the combo of the cheese and homemade TI sauce was perfect. I got mine med rare- I think next time I may opt for medium just because it was a hot mess trying to eat and I felt like all eyes were on me as the juices were dripping all over!  If you're on the burger train that is taking over Philly right now, you must try Village Whiskey. Garces has outdone himself again.  $64 for for two burgers, Fries and 1 beer may seem like a lot but the quality and ingredients put into your meal is worth every penny ( and lbs of fat your gain!)",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0

"So, I think initially I stayed away from this place because it seemed really pretentious and had a lot of things on the menu that I thought were really ""extra""... if you know what I mean.  But, we received a gift card and decided to go one evening for date night. We had a reservation and even though I accidentally put it under the wrong name - they didn't even question it even though I could tell that they could not find my reservation (because OpenTable account is under maiden name... ugh) they did not let me know that and did not challenge me when I swore that I had made the reservation for 6:30. They sat us immediately without ostracizing us. (haha) I later went up and confessed that I realized I had put it under a different name but appreciated their customer service and vote of confidence. Customer service impressions are a big deal to me - I feel like thats part of what you pay for when you go out and businesses who care how I *feel* in their establishment are half the ""battle"" for pleasing me as a customer.   We sat near the open kitchen; the decor is so eclectic and artsy - Katie's husband Ted supplies a good amount of the interior artwork - very cool stuff!  We decided to try the Roasted caulilflower and several different types of pizza. Yes, we ordered four different pizzas knowing the majority was going home with us for later lunches (Who doesn't love cold pizza for breakfast and lunch the next day?)... Hands down the roasted corn and zucchini pizza sounds weird but its by far one of my favorites. The cauliflower appetizer was perfectly seasoned and cooked perfectly - cauliflower can be mushy if you do it wrong. The pizza is amazing... the PIZZA IS AMAZING... soft and doughy and you can eat every bit of it. Some pizza places make wood fired pizza and then the crust is too chewy that you cannot eat it. The flavors of the pizza went together so well and things you didn't think go together, totally go together. Secondly, you will see tons of Yelp tips saying that you have to try the roasted chicken pizza - do it. The corn and zucchini pizza and roasted chicken are my two favorites. I dream about these pizzas... and when I want to cheat... I think about calling Postmates and have these delivered to my home... and some times I have done just that. Yes, I also have a treadmill in my house... ...WORTH. IT.   Speaking of which - when I did order via Postmates and the pizzas got mixed up and were mixed up with some pizzas that were not the corn and zucchini and roasted chicken they offered to send me gift cards, make new ones for me, comp two additional pizzas and have them ready for postmates or have two fresh pizzas made for me and have them waiting (I chose this option); the woman on the phone lead with ""How can we make this right? This is not exemplary of us."" - that's awesome. I went ahead and drove up and got the correct pizzas, no big deal, and they were hot and ready to go. Businesses make mistakes, especially when everyone is painfully busy on a friday night, its how they handle it that makes the difference.   The ingredients that you are getting at Katie's are extremely fresh and complex. You're not getting basic red sauce and bits of meat served at room temp - you're getting a totally different type of pizza experience. We love Katie's and have been back, ordered carryout, several times.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 5.0

Don't worry the potato is not actually a pastry, they are just calling it that. So go ahead and try it. The twin lobsters are market price and we paid $39.95 for each plate.

She was rude by ignoring me and intentionally choosing to wait on a newly arriving customer even though I had been standing there waiting for several minutes. She'll never know but I'm a good tipper, and there were four of us.  We did not order the entire evening, so dba lost income.

"I've only had their vegan pizzas so this is probably not a fair review but here goes...  I totally appreciate that they have vegan cheese! That being said, it's definitely not the best vegan pizza I've ever had. If deciding between the deep dish or ny style I would definitely do the deep dish. Crusts are obviously different on the two and the ny style was very hard and crunchy instead of crisp and soft like I am used to. The deep is more enjoyable and actually tasted even better cold the next day. Great decor inside and I love the historic kenwood building. The service has always been friendly.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I booked a private dance trolley in late September after a wedding. I communicated for months with the staff via email and requested that we stop at the beach and at the giant fig tree by the train station so we could dance safely and take photos. I also paid an extra fee to bring on beer and wine. We were told the trolley could hold 35 people. We trimmed our guest list, made special arrangements for little kids and the elderly and got our numbers down to 32. The trolley arrived on time however the trolley does not accommodate 35 people, it accommodates 25 people sitting and 10 people would have to stand the entire time. That is their idea of accommodating 35! We were not told this up front. Six of my guests felt there was no room for them and went back to their hotel and missed out on the fun. The driver had not been told we were bringing on beer and wine and tried to stop us. There is no room for a cooler any way, so it took up even more seating room. The driver never took us to the beach or to the fig tree. She only took us to the mission ( which was lovely) and the bathrooms. Next thing I knew it was over and I was asking, what about the beach? The fig tree? No one had told her so all of my months of communication was a waste of my time and effort. The trolley was a lot of fun but these details severely affected our opinion of this company. I immediately contacted the office via email and never heard one word from them. They had been paid in advance and apparently didn't care one bit what my experience was or that all of our communication was a waste of time. My advice? Buyer beware.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 3.0

Good portion sizes and decent prices. The only thing I could complain about is times that I have ate in and have gotten unfriendly service.

"After many years hearing Pietro's was one of Sparks best restaurants we made a visit. Very friendly staff was the highlight.   The food was basic Italian American style with a side of pasta and sliced vegetables coming with main courses along with a soup or house salad to start. Surprising cuisine as I thought the owner or chef was from Italy. Ceasar salad was a disappointment as it was an up charge but the dressing didn't seem homemade and it either had no anchovies or so little you couldn't taste it.   Decor was very dated with popcorn ceilings and unusual sections of trellis wrapped with plastic vines on the ceiling. Wine list was limited, would like to see more options especially a larger selection of Italian wines.   Will I be back? Probably not but glad we tried. I do very much support these restaurants that have been around a long time but wish Pietro's would update their menu, add more wine options, and remodel the interior which looks to be the original interior from when they opened 30+ years ago.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I'd like to give this place a poor review so it remains the gem that it is.  But since we went via yelp reviewers the chat is out of le sac!  Thankfully, their food is way superior to my French.   Several things to consider here.  First this is a cozy and romantic restaurant so try not to bring babies or parties over 8...  the space isn't equipped for that.  Second, if possible try to make a reservation on a weeknight as from reading some of the reviews the kitchen gets a bit overwhelmed when it gets slammed.  Third, try to relax and enjoy the ambiance. ..  service is deliberate because the kitchen obviously cares!  If you're in a rush, you will not do this place justice.  In my mind this is a date night kinda place and should be enjoyed for the wonderful and relaxed experience you're about to have.  That being said there were plenty of foodies, non date types as well.  Get (or bring  - $15 corkage) a nice bottle of wine and enjoy some solid French food.  We started out with a beet and goat cheese salad which was perfectly dressed with both the cheese and beets having wonderful flavors.  Next we had the mushroom crostini which again was delicious... we scraped the plate with the warm bread at our table.  Last we had the duck and the venison (special).  My wife thought the duck with plum sauce over mashed potatoes and greens was superior to the venison with a pomegranate sauce over mashed potatoes and greens but I beg to differ.  Regardless,  both were fabulous with the flavors being intense but perfectly matched between the meets and sauce.  We ate all of these wonderful offerings with a delightful bottle of pinot noir we purchased earlier in the day from a local winery.  Unfortunately we were too full to enjoy dessert but we overheard people raving about the flourless chocolate cake... not surprising.  Overall experience 19/20 when combining the above with the very reasonable price for such quality.   Bravo!    p.s.  we are foodies and we would question poor reviews when dining off the main menu.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"It's not very often I found myself in St. Albert, since I'm usually on the other side of Edmonton, but I was in St. Albert today. I remember visiting this cafe last year, before attending a Litfest session at the library, and I wanted to go back. Of course my stupid GPS didn't recognize the address of the cafe (it also did not recognize half the addresses in St. Albert) but I found the cafe. Went in and ordered an Americano and a piece of carrot cake. The have a gluten free bakery so the carrot cake may have been gluten free. I didn't check (I'm also not celiac so it's no bother to me either way). The point being the carrot cake really good, nice and moist (or un-dry for those of you with an aversion to the ""m"" word). The coffee was good, they have a nice selection of coffee drinks. They apparently have fair trade coffee. I also saw a poster about live music and dinner, but I didn't investigate too much. I loved the yellow colour, and the pictures on the wall - not sure of it's of the owner's family or what but it gives a little homey touch to the place. Free wifi, plenty of seating. The coffee was good, nothing mind blowing, but good and the service was prompt and friendly.

"My friends and I came here for dinner tonight and it was really quaint. I got takeout from here awhile ago but never really got the chance to sit down and eat. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but once you step inside you're greeted with a quaint chinese sit-in restaurant that's very different from most.   Environment: Slightly dim but complimented with just the right amount of light. Very cozy, with a big fish tank in the front, and tables off to the side for a more quiet setting. It's quiet inside, but just what I'd need after a long day out in the cold.   Food: What I ordered -   Sweet and Sour Chicken with pork fried rice and veggie roll. The chicken was very tender, and the sauce wasn't overly greasy. The egg roll was a tad bare, but it was good. The pork rice was well seasoned, and not greasy at all. Very good and complemented with a free side of cabbage.   FREE hot tea that tastes pleasant. Also free water which was great. Definitely a plus for this place.   Service: The guy we had was funny. Very generous and came back often to check on us. Even swapped out stuff for my friend who had a seafood allergy. He refilled our water glasses multiple times. He also struck up conversation. We tipped him well for his kindness.  Overall Experience: Very cozy and comfortable :) I liked it and would come back.

"Per the recommendation of a rest area information attendant we went and requested the Winter Special. The food was fantastic and a 3 course meal that was well proportioned for only $20.18 was a great deal. By all means I would say my food rating would be a 4 or 4.5 out of 5.      Why I give it an overall 3 is because we were a bit disappointed as we requested a tour of Antoine's but our server didnt really seem interested in provided us with a tour or giving us information on how we could go about getting a tour.  He just said he was busy, knowing we requested this before we were seated.  Also, the service we received was subpar compared to what we read Antoine's is known for...our server was robotic, a bit short with us and underattentive.  He even brought bread to our table just wrapped in a napkin with know serving dish; however, all other tables were receiving bread on dishes.  Perhaps, we caught our server on a bad day, but the resturant has a good vibe to it.

That was the one time we did not see a waiter for a while, so my boyfriend finished his dessert.  When the waiter finally checked in I showed him the hair sticking out of the cake. It was definitely not my hair because it did not match my hair color or length and was really embedded in there.

But I locked my sights on one thing which was the garlic chicken. It was not bad and the quality of the food was good. I would go back again for more. There wasn't that many people in the establishment but that was probably because we where there around 2pm. Not really during rush hour.   This place is located right on Virginia street. So parking is not very good. You will have to park in the back which can be a bit of a trek and for you ladies, well I would bring a friend with you. The staff is friendly and got to our order right away. They were actually just watching us and when we stopped looking at our menus they were quick to take our order. That is service and a great job on staff. Waiting for the food did not take long at all. Like I was saying we were not there during peak hours.   This place gets plenty of foot traffic from Virginia Street and can become really busy. Especially, if there is an event going on. I would keep that in mind if you decide to go here during those times. Your waiting time and experience might be different.

The first time I went here I was very pleased with my nails except for the fact that the man doing my nails was completely barefoot walking around the store. I went back a second time and won't be back. A different man did my nails and it looks like a child painted my nails. I have gel all over the sides of every finger and not to mention I was charged $30 for a basic fill which was advertised as $14 in their window.,Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 2.0
"I eat here a lot. It's close and the inside is very clean. The service is usually good, but not always. The food is good for the most part. I like their pizza. Very good dough. The sauce however is a little too sweet. The cheesesteaks and hoagies are good.  I had a panini once  that was horrible. The steak was so tough I could barely chew it.  The last few times the service could have been better. More than once I called to order and was put on hold for over a minute. I just hung up and called someplace else. And it wasn't a busy weekend. The last time I ordered a pizza I got there to pick it up almost 30 minutes later and they hadn't even made it yet. When they did finally bring it to me it was undercooked.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 3.0
"Stumbled across this market while in the area & so glad I did! We didn't dine in the restaurant, but just went into the market & ordered a variety of the pastries. There were no labels on the different offerings so I'm not totally positive what they were called, but they had halvah and a number of different small pastries that seemed to be variations on baklava. We ordered the different pastries (some with walnuts and some with pistachios) and all were very good. There was one that looked like a little bird's nest made with noodles & it had the same baklava-type flavor, but with an extra crispy and unexpected texture from the noodles.  All were pretty one-note sweet, but nevertheless very satisfying! Delicious little afternoon snack & definitely worth a stop!  The market also features a very large variety of middle-eastern specialty food items.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"This was one of the first places I'd eaten in Indy when I moved here almost 20 yrs ago and went hunting for ethnic food. So among Indian food restaurants, it's a bit nostalgic for me. I've found better places since. But when we found ourselves in Broad Ripple Station with a line out the door at Biscuits Cafe, we decided to give old Shalimar another go.  Their lunch buffet has variety enough, and they keep the food fresh and hot. They have a whole cold bar with desserts, salads and condiments; and two hot bar sections with samosas and pakoras, two kinds of naan (garlic and plain), two rice (plain basmati and peas pulao), and several chicken and vegetarian options such as saag and chana masala (chickpeas). I could find neither paneer nor mushrooms in the saag, so I don't know if it was plain or what. They did have one lamb entree, meatballs, which tasted only faintly of lamb (not that I like it gamey, but I also don't want it to taste like ""plain"" ground beef). I had a little bit of almost everything and it was all acceptable, just a bit underwhelming in the flavor department.  If you don't like spicy food and/or want to ease your way into Indian, Shalimar is your place.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Wow, these were the NICEST rental car employees ever!  After waiting in line for about 10 minutes, I was getting antsy.  The ""hungry grumps"" (as Krys B. dubs them) were about to take over me, so if I didn't get into a rental car ASAP, things were not going to end well.  Luckily, I was greeted by the friendliest Enterprise employee of my life.  Not only was he funny and informative, but he didn't try to push me into upgrading the rental to some insane Mustang convertible.  This guy even handed over some maps/pamphlets that proved to be very useful on the trip.  Can I also mention that the rates were fabulous?  Car rental for the whole week was less than $200!    The employee who actually showed us to our car was really nice as well.  He was even going to let us choose between two or three cars, but we opted for the Hyandai closest to us.  I, also, really loved that he didn't push the rental coverage and was fine that I was going to go through my own insurance.

"I shop here all the time.  They have a great selection of fresh produce and bakery items.  All the standard stuff like any other grocery store.  My only beef is that their strawberries and blueberries are always almost rotten, rarely do I catch them at the perfect ripeness stage, so I never buy these here.  Otherwise everything else seems great.  I love the fact that they have self checkout which saves a lot of time for me.  This feature has become an important deciding factor for me of where I will shop for groceries. And the fact that they have a loyalty card which is a bonus because you get discounts on select items.  Overall decent service whenever you need help and prices are comparable to the other chains.

"Sounds like many of us have nothing good to say about this place.  It's a very unprofessional and cold environment.  The staff are rude.  They speak to each other in Chinese but make no conversation or eye contact with patrons.  When they did speak, it was short and abrupt.  I went 2x only because I bought vouchers.  The 1st time, I was supposed to have a 50min massage.  I was only given a 25 minute massage!  My friend & I went the 2nd time and were there first thing in the morning.  Because I had to leave early, I had all my services done first.  When I left, all my friend needed was her manicure.  They totally ignored her, served several other customers coming in.  We got there at 10am but my friend didn't leave until almost 3 o'clock!!!   It's beyond me that this place is still in business.  I would never, EVER recommend this place.

"Traveling from California to Nashville for our daughter's college graduation I realized I'd forgotten to buy a fresh orchid lei to give her after the ceremony. This is a tradition in our area, and we wanted her to have a piece of home. I looked on Yelp for a florist, knowing this would be a long shot as it's really a regional item that one might normally only find in Hawaii, or in our area of Los Angeles with a substantial Hawaiian population and influence. I emailed Laurel & Leaf after seeing their ad. By the time we landed, Stacy had replied! She was very up front about cost, and I was very particular about timeframe, basically giving her 24 hours to procure flowers she did not have in stock to make a floral piece she had never made before. After a phone call and a few texts, a high-ish price (which I completely expected), and a looonnnggg drive to get to her lovely shop, we had a beautiful lei for our graduate. Stacy had it ready early, even. She was fantastic to work with, responsive, and her designs are gorgeous.

The calamari Fries were thick cut, tough, and chewy and the parmasean herb oysters were undercooked? But simultaneously dry...just not the best. Me and my husband have had oysters at two different spots over the last two weeks raw and cooked and they were way better than the ones received from The OYSTER bar. The only real redeeming thing was our server as he was nice and prompt. We were in the restaurant with a another couple at the same time who also seemed to have issues with their food and who warned us about the oysters.

"So this review is a few years in the making, I seen this Cameron Duncan when I first came back to Reno after my wife dying, I told a few friends where I was going to for my medical care and they all said DO NOT DO IT, He is horrible, I gave it a chance and boy did I regret it, After he seen what medications I was on and have been on for 5+ years, He decided to change it with out discussing it with me, and took me off of medications the he said he felt I didn't need because he 1. Doesn't believe people need to be on that type of medication and 2. All I am doing is numbing myself with those medications because I am wanting to forget my wife dying, I called him out on it, saying I gave been on the same meds for over 5 years, It has nothing to do with the passing of my wife, I told him that I will not change my meds and that I better get the meds I was one for years, Not knowing he was the owner I asked to speak to someone in charge to complain, and I get a guy who is his husband ( Now I don't care about him being gay, As I am not that straight myself and have tons of family and friends who are gay ) Comes at me like I threatened his husband, and yelled at me, Told me he can ruin my healthcare if I went to the BBB, All of this after I told him that I want the same meds I havebeen on for years, and that it works for me, He told me flat out NO and that he will RED FLAG all of my scripts if I went somewhere else, Also I should mention that his Mental health person that is there is just as bad, She told me that it was my fault my wife died because I did not try hard enough to revive her, and she also will not give me the medications I have been on, saying that I am addicted and that I should just pray away the depression and PTSD, It took so much for me not to slap the taste out of their mouths for that comment. Duncan and his crew of quacks should be put in jail for their negligence and possibly fraud, Because they billed my insurance for a vitamin check and they did a drug screening, and nothing stated a drug screen, just a vitamin check, I will also report them to the DEA, and other agencies for a check on their billing, I wont be surprised if there is fraud going on, Before his husband jumps and attacks me on here, It has been a few years since I seen them, and I work in the healthcare field, So I do know what I am talking about, Also when I had to call about getting a copy of my own records, I was told that I could not because its against company policy, This was told to me by someone named Mia or something like that, Which is a total LIE, Because I work in that field in medical care, So I do know that I can get a copy of my own records, With out a fee, I will call again at a later date to again get a copy of my own records and she had such a huge attitude like she is above GOD, Well hell that is everyone in that office, They all think they are above god, So I highly suggest people do not go there, and Most of these positive reviews are done so by their family and friends, and some people even are paid for those reviews.

"We were trying to find a place to have dinner last night, and Otra Vez came up on Eater NOLA's Hottest Restaurants of October list. We looked up the menu and it was huge and looked great. We found street parking nearby and went in. The restaurant is very modern and classy.  We were seated immediately. Upon receiving the menu, we realized the menu we saw was for Otra Vez Cantina in Colorado... whoops.. The menu is small, with few options. I would've liked to see more, but it is what it is. The tacos are $11/2, which is steep but right along the lines of a Johnny Sanchez. We ordered the steak tacos, drum (fish) tacos, pumpkin blossom quesadilla, and spicy red rice & black bean side.  The drum taco was great. The fish was cooked perfectly, and the flavors & textures of the mango/radish salsa and pistachio mole complimented one another perfectly. All it needed was a squeeze of the lime wedge and it was perfect.  The steak taco was very very good. It was all the flavor you'd want from a steak taco. The only knock, it was tough. That said, skirt steak is tough. And it was so well seasoned that though it was chew-intensive, it never lost flavor.  I'd recommend both.  The quesadilla was okay. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't anything to write home about. For the $12 paid, I should've ordered more tacos.  The spicy red rice and beans was $5 but nothing more than the flavors of a boxed Spanish rice and a can of black beans warmed up. Definitely a pass.  All-in-all, I think a 4 was earned. The quesadilla and rice wasn't the best, but the tacos were very good and I look forward to coming back to try the others on the menu.  Aside from food, our waiter was kind and patient. He informed us of sides and offered dessert after. The churros sounded good, but we ended up not ordering.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Pleaaaaaaaaaase don't get tricked by the rating of reviews here. This place seems like a hit or miss and unfortunately my one visit was a complete miss. Came here while visiting Saint Louis and granted I walked in with high expectations. 4.5 stars reviews? This place had to be good.   Totally disappointed. I first suspected that my nail technician(short hair) lady  was distracted because it seemed like she was rushing my pedicure and gel manicure I confirmed that suspicion when she caused my toe to bleed while cutting my dead skins. She was really rough with this process and accidentally cut too much skins off my toe. My toe started bleeding profusely. She seemed super embarrassed and apologized but it was a deep cut. My polish wasn't good because she polished over my skin a lil bit. She used some kind of brush to clean it up but the polish still looks thick, not shiny or smooth. It also has bubble in it. My gel manicure was awful. She rushed and cut my cuticles and makes two of my fingers bleeding. The toe was bleeding and now fingers bleeding too!!!! Wtf!!! The gel polished wasn't good because she have to use the nail file to file on the sides of finger nails because there were polish on the side skins of my finger nails. I want my eyebrow to be done but they said they don't have time to do it because they are waiting on new customers!!! (It was definitely painful that day and a few days after as well.)   My gel mani started peeling only a week after. What a waste of money!!!  Now I get accidents happen here and there, but where I'm from, at least the local place that I go to - the owners are always so generous with this kind of stuff. Your nail technician messes up, you get some sort of a discount. But nope. Lady charged me full price and I walked out of that shop with a mediocre manicure with two cuts on my fingers and a thick polished with bubble pedicure and a cut to my toe.It seem like they rushed me out to do the next customers!!

I wanted one to shake off the remnants of the day prior, I ended up with one more to remember the taste and a third to get going on today. We sat right in front of the band which gave a first hand account of every note of the wonderful music that is jazz. Our server at the table was super friendly and efficient and made our visit extra enjoyable.  Bamboula's, thank you for being an establishment with great drinks, great music, great food and an overall great vibe.

"I have resisted writing a review for Charlie's because I'm loathe to give a vegan place less than 5 stars. But I do enjoy Charlie's and 4 isn't half bad!  I really enjoy coming here for happy hour or they're a place I never imagined as a Sips location (summertime) but if you can make it on a Wednesday and stake a claim at the bar, dine your heart out.  The cocktails are very good, the food is also good - but for this kind of atmosphere, I feel like the food is too heavy/junk-food like, without being in the comfort food realm. That is, I feel like the menu is missing freshness and lightness, and most things are very heavy. Maybe that's what they want to go for! But for a ""tapas"" style menu it throws me off. It's rarely my first choice, but especially if I want a drink and some heavier snacks, Charlie's is a good pick for that.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0

The others had the generous burger topped with fried egg and chunky fries, the tasty Greek lamb tacos and the Gorgonzola salad.  Everybody was well satiated at the end!

"This used to be one of my favorite places to eat. Hadn't been there in a while & had dinner this week.    Went around 4-ish, so not crowded at all.  There was no host to greet us when we came in & someone eventually wandered up. Asked for a table rather than a booth and out of all the tables in the nearly empty restaurant, we were seated right in front of the kitchen.  It was really loud. Might not have mattered if it were busy, we might not have noticed the noise - loud laughing, plates breaking, etc. Our table was also being pestered by what looked like little fruit flies that I can only assume flew out of the kitchen following the food.   The food was mediocre at best. Most of our entrees were over cooked to some degree. I suppose we could have sent things back, but it wasn't inedible and we didn't have the time, so we ate it.   On the plus side, our waitress was very nice.    I don't think I'll be trying this Red Lobster again anytime soon. Too bad, because it's conveniently close to home.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I've been to The Electric Factory an abundent amount of times, but it's sadly one of my least favorite concert halls. Electric Factory from the outside to the inside interior has so much promise to be a 'hip' edgy venue. But the acoustics are just bad, bad, badddd. It kind of ruins it all.  We came here last night for a private show then to see Circa Survive later on in the night. We arrived at the time we were supposed to be there and everything ran smoothly. Staff moved us effecitantly to the green room / meet and greet. However, the staff is pretty damn miserable. The main guy checking ID's out front actually looked like he wanted to die being there. Once the private show was done they brought us around back and had us re - enter in the VIP section. Again, ran very smoothly. My husband and I luckily were the first ones to enter the bar area and were able to grab seats over looking the stage. Oh, and be prepared to spend an arm and a leg on drinks!   Now I went to this show because I'm a fan of three of the four bands that played last night. With being a fan I know the lyrics to their songs. Because the acoustics are so bad I often found myself wondering what the heck they were saying. The sound is extremely muffled and very unclear. It's really a shame. Even when recording videos all you can hear is the background guitars and such. -- We ended up heading out earlier so when we got to our car we realized we had another car behind us enabling us to back out. We went to one of the staff members out front on what to do and the lady was so horrible about it. Rude, and just overall a total asshole. I'm looking at you Reds. Then she proceeded to very aggressively move the gates in front of us acting like we were a total inconvience. I'm really not a fan of having attitude over things that are probably in your job title.

"I love the look of this spot. Super cool vibe with very friendly wait staff.  Because it was my first time, they even gave me a huge baguette to take home!!  My only critique is that I thought there was a little too much going on in the turkey and cheese sandwich. I had to scrape the sauce off the bread because the flavor was overpowering.  And the side dish that comes with your meal is the ""house side"" that changes daily. It was potato salad when I went. Tasty, but the potatoes weren't as soft as I am used to in potato salad. Not a problem, just a difference.  Again, I will be going back to try some of the other awesome items on the menu!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I am considered plus size in bridal gowns, and everything Amy pulled was in my size or a size larger so I could try them on and get a sense of how they would look in my size.

"Based on the opposite extremes of opinion of this restaurant when my companion told me we were going here for our Friday night, I figured, at worst, we'll see another part of the South side of Edmonton :-) XiX Nineteen is situated in a strip mall much like Vivo and Bistecca (parking is ample but you have to ""know"" WHERE it is in the strip mall).    The first thing that struck me when we walked in was the line of people, all on their cellphones texting (perhaps to let others know they had arrived?).  The second thing that I noticed was how noisy it was :-( Yes, it is VERY noisy (people talking everywhere loudly noisy).  So, if you are wanting a ""quiet, romantic"" evening, this is NOT the place.  Beyond the host/hostess desk there is a curtain and that leads to the lounge area....it is hidden away, something that is nice, but I am wondering if the group that owns this place did any ""sound proofing"" since it is SO noisy (I know, I said this already).  On to our meal... Seated quickly (we made reservations), our waiter was at our table within a couple of minutes with water and also to greet us.  We got the wine list and WOW. No, there are not any bottles of anything under 40$ unless you go with their ""house"" wines, then you get under 40$ but not by much.  We had a house Chardonnay which was quite good (our waiter, Mike was kind enough to let us know how ""oaky"" it would be :-) ). With the nice selection of entrees, though most of them with a pasta or rice, for my appetizer, I chose the bacon wrapped scallops with rice balls and my companion the half order of Kale and Quinoa Salad and for my entree I chose the Hoisin Braised Short Ribs, my companion the Lobster Ravioli with Shrimp and Cream. The Kale and Quinoa Salad was VERY good and well dressed.  The flavour of the dressing was not too heavy and with the Quinoa it was a nice complement :-) My scallops were good (2 of them, medium sized) wrapped in one slice of bacon with a nice cream and the accompanying chutney was very tasty.  The little rice balls were about the size of a small jawbreaker candy and also good as they were bland enough to enjoy with the chutney.  (I will say, I enjoyed the Kale and Quinoa Salad here more than the one I had at Canteen.) Our entrees came and the Short Ribs were VERY good and tender, tender....I didn't need a knife to cut it at all.  They were served with baby carrots and 3 onion rings on top.  Nice plating and it was a perfect size portion :-)  The ravioli were also quite good and also quite spicy.  The waiter had mentioned this, however, they do have a ""bite"" as my companion then commented.  He enjoyed them to the point that though there seemed to be too much cream for me, he was happy to make a ""scarpetta"" (little shoe, in italian) to enjoy the cream that was left :-) with the bread they had brought (sliced light rye). There were also a reasonable number of shrimp in the dish and a good size too. For dessert I had the Creme Brulee which was good and my companion the Signature Butter Cake.  The cake comes with a small scoop of ice cream (smaller than the dollop of whipped cream I got for my bread pudding at the Glass Monkey ;-) ) which is from Pinocchio (they include this info on the menu).  It was definitely buttery, but not greasy.  In all a really good meal with very good service all around.....the noise level, however, is a SERIOUS let down....so though I have given it a 4, the noise level would really put it at a 3.5 for me.  Afterall, when the staff comments on the noise as well, it ISN'T good either since for them it is SO important to be able to hear their patrons well ....   We would be game to venture back when the patio opens up and yes, for another meal....because, it was that good, for me, anyway :-)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I had previously complained about this Taco Bell location and its notoriously poor customer service to the corporate website. That complaint which was made last year seemed to have fallen on deaf ears because the specific employees I had complained about are still working at said location.    First, a little about my experience in the past. I had a minor complaint that could have easily been dealt with but when I asked the girl (yes she was a teenager, most employees are at this location) to ask the manager to fix the complaint she just advised me that he was busy. Did not ask anyone; just told me this. Then when I asked for his name and the owner's name. I received a reply of ""German"" for his name. No name for the owner and a bogus phone number. The girl preparing food next to what I assumed to be the manager(male) at the time (again another teenager) rolled her eyes and said, ""Doesn't she know our DM quit!"" She couldn't have stood any closer to him if she tried. I informed them that they would be losing my business and I would be contacting corporate. Their exact response: ""We are a franchise. We are not owned by corporate.""Not only did I say that they represent Taco Bell, but I said they would be losing my business as I would now be having to travel to another Taco Bell rather than deal with their service a block from my house.      This visit was an improvement yet still messed up the order as is always the case. There was one gentleman in front of me ordering in the dining room. I ordered after him. He got his food and left. I overheard the conversation on the backline of this Taco Bell as I was wondering what was taking my 1 item of food so long. I ordered the new Nacho Fry Bell Grande. Turns out they had given the gentleman in front of me my order as well as his and had to make me a new one. This among other food mishaps are consistent to the point customers must check their food every time to make sure it is correct and all items are there.   I'm really not trying to bash on these employees considering the fast food industry is where I got my start and I continued for 6 years before moving on to bigger things to pursue my passions. I just have a hard time when the employees make the customer feel like it is an inconvenience on them (employees) to serve the customer not only food but with respect as well.

"This is an absolutely gorgeous place and a must-go (in my opinion) if you're near downtown Tampa. I read somewhere that depending on your view, it can be a large house or a small town. I had expected there to be more shops, as I had heard it was a shopping-dining experience, but I was ok with it not having anything else! There is a bookstore and an eye wear store at one end of the building, and a general store selling different stuff like home decorations, cute kitchen things, notebooks, scarves, etc at the other end. Then, in the middle, you have a tea shop with delicious varieties of tea flavors. The lady there was very helpful and listened to what I described I wanted and based on that, made me a mix of carrot cake and maharajah chai latte , and it was absolutely wonderful. There's also a cafe (Buddy Brew) if you want coffee and espresso, they also have some croissants and pastries (I tried a chocolate croissant and it was ok).   There is a restaurant in the middle as well and we went there for lunch on another day. I got the flatbread , which was a bit salty but delicious. My friend's burger was ok too.

"By far this is my favorite hotel and it is really quite saddening that is has been in the process of being remodeled over the last few years. The El Encanto is Santa Barbara's oldest hotel built in 1913. It may be time for a face lift but in its closure it is greatly missed. Luckily the company that purchased the property, Orient-Express Hotel chain, is at least attempting to restore the hotel to its original dignity. Instead of the usual hotel layout, the El Encanto is made up of many Craftsman and Spanish Colonial Revival cottages with lily ponds, gardens, panoramic views of the ocean and downtown Santa Barbara scattered in between. Hopefully the reopening will be sometime this year; the unfortunate part is the rates are said to be triple the amount they were in the past. An overnight stay is said to be starting around $650 for the standard room. This is quite a jump since before the same room would go for a little under $200 a night which was an absolutely fabulous deal. Regardless this is a gorgeous property and if anything it should continued to be appreciated for its history and beauty even if it may only be enjoyed with a glass of wine at the bar.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"We did our homework before visiting the showroom by checking the website and taking measurements. We went on Presidents Day, so we showed up close to opening to avoid a long wait. We were quickly greeted by Michael Goldstein and the rest went smoother than we could have imagined. He asked all the right questions and made some suggestions that we hadn't thought of (very thorough). We were shown a variety of styles based on our taste. Michael stayed within our budget and explained everything in detail as we went through the countertop promotional package. The only thing left for us to do is pick out the cooktop from a local appliance store. They make it so easy. Michael was so patient despite a very bustling showroom by the time we left.

"This modern, somewhat industrial, bar + restaurant is unexpected for a venue situated in a new commercial development in St. Charles. The space feels large and open like a warehouse - but warm and enjoyable as the seating space allows for intimate space for couples or larger groups. The glass enclosed wine cellar that reaches to the ceiling toward the back wall reminds me of something you would see in a Las Vegas restaurant (and allows me to imagine that a young man has to climb up a ladder to fetch a new bottle - present it to the sommelier who is secretly working in the kitchen to appropriately pair the wines with each menu item - is opened - tasted - and then poured for my enjoyment). ***I recognize how ridiculous and unlikely it is that anyone went through that amount of trouble to prepare and serve my single glass of Chardonnay at yesterday's lunch - but still - it provides some fun imagery!   The lunch menu offers an array of options - from appetizers (hummus, sesame crusted ahi tuna), flatbreads, salads, burgers (recommended by our server), and entrees. The breakfast items were tempting (I was oh so close to ordering a strawberry banana chocolate crepe to satisfy my morning sweet tooth)!   Our server was sweet, attentive, and accommodating.   Overall, an enjoyable experience. I look forward to returning in the future for dinner (to sample their sushi and cocktail menu).",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"We came here with a group of ten, which included 2 vegans and 2 vegetarian children. The restaurant has a policy of using a fixed menu for parties of 6 or more and this was creating some problems for the non meat eaters in our group.   This is where the host at Audrey Claire set himself apart. He called me back and explained that, while the fixed menu makes it a lot easier for them, he would allow us to choose whether or not to order from it. Also, he added that the vegans could order a la carte if they so pleased (which they did). Service like this deserves to be recognized.   As for the food itself, the flatbread with pear and Gorgonzola (I think) was delicious!

"It's not the best Chinese food but where else are you going to go for Chinese food in King of Prussia? Clearly Pin Wei knows the answer is no where else (because there isn't anywhere else) and his menu prices reflect that. The average is about $40/person and service is slow/poor. Don't expect to have your water refilled or the check to be picked up without you reminding the staff.  The dishes are hit or miss, however, they are plated beautifully.  Here are the dishes that we ordered and whether or not you should skip them! Beef and Tripe with chili oil -  Large thinly slices of beef and tripe that's spicy. It's a tasty and authentic dish, if you don't like tripe then they can do one without it.  Water spinach sauteed with garlic - It's a standard dish, except here you will pay $17 for it. If the price doesn't detour you then order it!  pea leave sauteed with garlic - Skip this, texture is similar to grass and this dish is $19. Skip this  Tea smoked duck - Skip this. One word: Bland.  Chicken with dry peppers - Skip this, not much chicken and what chicken is present are nib-lets (is that a word?)  Hot and Spicy Beef - A large bowl of spicy beef served over bean sprouts in hot oil. This dish is big enough to serve 4 people. It's got the perfect amount of spice and numbness.  Meat buns - Juicy meat packed into steamed buns. Try it!  Mapo Spicy fish cubes- It doesn't sound appetizing but it is. It's Tofu cubes served with fish in a spicy sauce.

Coffee shots burn in 8 seconds unless they are added to something. The minute the shot goes from a nutty brown to black, it's burnt. They have home made ice cream that's also very good and they wine if you like to drink. They offer coconut milk and almond as well as soy. I always get coffee inch of steamed soy, because I feel the nuttiness of coffee pairs well with the nuttiness of soy, and it keeps the calories lower.   The staff is pretty hipster but not pretentious at all. Very laid back vibe, while still being welcoming. They use an iPad to pay, I like this and auto adds tip.

"My wife and I had an excellent experience at the Peppermill for our ""mini-honeymoon""!   First off, we wanted to pick out the exact room for our special time after the wedding. So we went there and asked if we could see the rooms. No problem, they gave us a key to and allowed us to come back down to exchange keys to look at different rooms. We found a perfect room and the young man (can't remember name, was kind of short with black spikey hair) helping us at the desk  put a note on our reservation that we requested that specific room. We arrived on the scheduled date and were pleased to find we were able to be in the room we wanted! The room itself was very clean and very romantic. We were surprised how affordable it was even though it seemed so ""ritzy"" The only flaw I remember was that the bed sank in a little towards the middle, my wife didn't seem to notice but I did.  We were also surprised how enjoyable it was to eat at their ""cheap"" restuarant the ""Cafe Milano. The food was a little more costly than most casinos cheap food but we were both pleased. It was also surprising to find such great service at a ""24-hour"" casino restraunt. Both nights we had a greater server. First night we had an older heavier set woman that had such a wonderful attitude despite being at work at one in the morning. The second night a gentleman named Victor served us and did a great Job as well.   In my opinion this place is also the best looking and classiest casino/hotel in Reno. I love how they have bright LCD tvs everywhere bringing in outdoor scenes from all over. It really opens the place up and makes you feel like you're not in a dark grungy arcade like some casinos do.

We arrived on a busy Friday evening (Easter weekend), and had no trouble checking in at all - quick as smooth. The woman who checked us in was extremely helpful and friendly, and she gave us a map and took the time to give us an idea of where to go in Nashville, and made some recommendations for things to do - awesome! Our room was very nice - clean, well appointed, and a nice city view. There wasn't a minibar though - I wish there would've been.  The hotel property is beautiful and more or less brand new. We are at all of the restaurants, and felt they all were good. Barlines was a great place to grab a drink, watch the NCAA tourney, and listen to love music. Kitchen Notes was great for breakfast - do the buffet, and indulge in their amazing ""biscuit bar."" Bob's Steakhouse was also really good. We stopped at Bongo Java a couple of times for coffee, and thought it was good. We ordered room service a couple of times, and the food was really good, the service was fast, and the prices reasonable.  The hotel is really close to all of the fun on Broadway, but not too close if you know what I mean - a perfect location. It's also right behind the Bridgestone Arena, so if you are a hockey fan or in town for a concert this is a good place to stay. Same goes for conventions - the sparkling new convention center is right across the street. We thought it was neat that the Country Music Hall of Fame is attached to the hotel - really nice to have an attraction like that so close.  On our first night, we explored the city a bit, and when we came home, we found that the woman who checked us into the hotel sent up a lovely gift basket for us to enjoy - AMAZING!

A game at Tropicana resembles a neutral site game more than a Rays home game.  While the Rays fans truly love the team and baseball in general there aren't enough of them. There are enough to make going to a game a really fun event but even a contending season doesn't get the Rays out of the cellar in attendance rankings.  The Rays WILL leave St Pete.

Johnny Rockets is the popular choice being that we only have generic food court options like the Philly cheesesteak, ""Chinese"" and a ""healthy"" wrap place to choose from. The first couple of times I visited this JR they would always get my order wrong on separate occasions, specifically I would run into the same problem, them only giving me one patty on my burger instead of two. This probably happened about three times, It was getting so annoying to have to check my meal every time I left that I thought that I would call management or corporate being that I'm on a time crunch while on my break and the extra time inconveniences me but I never got around to doing so. Fortunately for me, my recent orders there have been correct and I attribute this to there being less people in the kitchen.

Instead of focusing on her job she talks to the line cook telling him how tired she is and every time I visit this restaurant stand she always seems like she wishes she were somewhere else, smile sometimes girl. In all their food is pretty decent, though I hate their fries and usually get a burger from JR then walk to the Philly place to get their fries instead.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I was curious to check out the new food court at the mall and decided to check out this salad place since it was a healthier alternative to Shake Shack and the line was moving along fast.  I was pretty impressed for what I got, expensive but worth it, the salad I got filled me up, the Guacamole greens and it had a bunch of avocado with chicken and tomatoes and the jalape√±o vinagrette was great, not over spicy , they seem to customize your salad to your needs even asking how heavy you want your dressing.  The drinks were pretty good too, I got a watermelon drink and one with lime and ginger, preferred the watermelon but both were refreshing.  Definitely would like to go back and try out other varieties, I'm a big fan of kale and quinoa so it's right up my alley!  The only negative I noticed was one of the workers kept looking behind him to see what to put in the salad, that would really annoy me especially if the line was long, they should know the salad ingredients by memory.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

Roast beef is my absolute favorite here but I have made a point the last few visits to try other things. To make up for my lack of roast beef I make sure to get it on some fries with cheddar cheese and justin the fabulous owner always sends a little extra sauce for me! The caprese poboy is super delicious and refreshing if you want something a bit lighter. They also have the best fried shrimp poboy and on Monday and Wednesday they do fried oyster (my mom's favorite with cheddar cheese and bacon and placed under the broiler). Today I got the hot sausage patty and really enjoyed it! It had great spice without being too spicy! I love parkway! If you are only in Nola for one day and/or only have time for one poboy stop  - this historic landmark should be where you stop! Oh and don't be alarmed if you see a really long line!

"@ Stan S.  Why didn't you go to your home country for surgery to begin with?  BTW, I have a relative who traveled to her ""home country"" for dental work.  The dentist there completed the work (12 root canals and several implants) over the course of 3 weeks.  It cost her one tenth of what it would have cost in the US.  So far, so good, right?  Keep reading.  Unfortunately, just before he installed the last of her crowns, she suffered a brain hemorrhage, and died two weeks after the family payed $150K to have her transported back to the US via private jet (air ambulance). An American dentist would never have agreed to do such extensive work in such a short time because he would have been aware of current medical literature, namely that serious dental work on a patient her age elevates the risk of hemorrhagic stroke.  An American dentist would have required her to have a full physical prior to starting such an extensive series of treatments, and would not have agreed to do such work in such a short time frame.  The ""home country"" dentist never even bothered to take her blood pressure before repeatedly giving her local anesthetic with epinephrine.  And because he is not under American licensing jurisdiction, we can't even press charges!  Another relative went abroad to her ""home country"" for plastic surgery and came back with Hepatitis C.  A friend's daughter went to get plastic surgery for her ears, and ended up with an infection that resulted in her having to stay abroad and miss an entire semester of school.  The horror stories are many.  While I agree that American physicians aren't perfect and often charge unreasonable fees, there are major risks to going to ""home countries"" for medical/dental/cosmetic procedures.  I would caution folks to take those risks seriously, and definitely purchase travelers' insurance.",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 4.0

"First, let me say that this review should not be a review of ALL Chipotle restaurants as every one of them EXCEPT for this one I have been to (and I have been to Chipotles in at least 4 different states) is EXCELLENT.  This Chipotle, however, falls well below the mark.    First off, I used the Iphone app mobile ordering.  Often, when you get to a Chipotle, there is a huge line for burritos, so I do the mobile ordering.  That way, you get to skip the line and go straight to the checkout and just pick up your food.  The app asks you when you want your food to be ready, so I specified 5:35 pm.  I showed up at 6:05 and walked up to the cashier and asked about my food.  He pointed me to the end of the line.  Confused, I walked to the end of the line and stood in it.  Apparently, they hadn't even begun to make my food.  So much for using the app and not waiting in line and paying ahead of time.  Never have I encountered that at a Chipotle before.  Never.   Secondly, as the woman was making my burrito, she put maybe a 1/4 cup of rice, layed three small pieces of carnitas on top of it and passed the burrito on to the next assembly line guy.  I was shocked.  The whole point of Chipotle is that they make GIANT burritos.  That is their whole deal.  That is their image.  Their drink cups extol the greatness of their huge burritos.  However, the burritos made at THIS Chipotle are nothing like that.  So, when my burrito got to the next guy, I complained about the tiny portions I had been given and told him that was not what I had come to expect from a Chipotle.  He said that that was the right amount and that the carnitas portion should fit in a tiny salsa cup.  Wow.  Usually when they finish my burrito, they can hardly wrap the tortilla around it because it is so full of their awesome ingredients.  However, at THIS Chipotle, there was so much tortilla left over that it was wrapped over on itself several times over.  I had a tiny torpedo burrito that cost $10.  Amazing.      Skip this Chipotle.  If this is the only one you ever go to, you'll think that they are all like this and be sorely disappointed.  Go to any other and you'll be happy.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Can I just say that when you are a terrified parent worrying about your child, you tend to be very picky about what care they receive? I won't lie, I definitely watched every persons every move.   My daughter was transferred from Carson Tahoe to renown over this last weekend, and it was admittedly the most scary time of my life. We were placed in a room at the pediatric ER, and they immediately started assessing her. Within minutes, they had already taken vitals, checked her foot, and given her some juice/crackers as they were trying to get her blood sugars up.  About 15 minutes later, the doctor came in and spoke with me. He was not judgmental for the situation we were in, and was actually very nice to me. He listened to what I had to say, and attempted to make me feel heard while taking care of her. They got an IV in her, and started being more aggressive with her glucose levels.   She ended up in the PICU, and I must say - those nurses and other staff are absolutely amazing! When she first got admitted, it was in the evening and the nurse practitioner assessed her immediately. They had orders in for her, and even got her medications quickly!   Even though it was one of the more terrifying nights of my life, the nurses, cna's, respiratory therapists, and everyone in between were amazing. Their child life specialists made inserting the IV, and other unpleasant experiences go by quicker. I wouldn't have wanted care from anywhere else. :)",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 5.0
"This buffet restaurant is attached to River City Casino and is usually used to bait heavy gamblers into the building.  It is a fairly large buffet with a reasonable variety of choices. An extra large salad bar and many ad hoc items that are fried and not always the freshest.  However, they usually have a couple of key items that make it worthwhile.  for example they offer all-you-can-eat crab legs most nights for $23.95 with all of the other buffet items still available at that price and you really can't get that anywhere.  It's fresher than the local Chinese buffet crab and its on par with a chain restaurant quality (Red Lobster/Joe's Crab Shack - not the best, but not the worst) and let's face it...  it's the Midwest.  It's hardly Crab-legville.  So, if you are craving crab legs and lots of them, this may be one of your better bets in the area for quality related to price.  Prime rib is another goody that they offer on a regular basis.

We found Belladonna Day Spa online and were intrigued by the services offered and the amazing prices. We had an amazing day that began with mimosas beside to koi pond followed by a soak in a still bath then sugar scrub and massage. We both left feeling refreshed and relaxed. We would both recommend Belladonna Day Spa to anyone visiting New Orleans who wants a day of relaxation at a fair price.,Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 5.0
"The doctor is fine, the billing department on the other hand lacks compassion for special circumstances. Was away taking care of dying family member. Was not getting mail. Never received a phone call that balance was due.   When I got home and realized we owed something they had already turned it over to collections. They refused to take payment at their office. They were completely rude to me and had no compassion under the circumstances.   Changed dentists because I want to go somewhere where the office individuals have compassion for extraordinary circumstances. Maybe they should review their collection process. We NEVER had any history of not making payment and have been patients there for over 20 years.",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 1.0
"I'm a frequenter of this place, always at dinner, and it has always been a good experience. We stopped by today for an impromptu Sunday brunch before Easter services at Sacred Heart. Don't know what happened but Bizzou has fallen off. Really bad service. Understaffed, long waits for everything. Dirty utensils, glassware, placemats. Tables sat uncleared the entire time we were there. I actually saw the Ma√Ætre D' take dirty dishes off one table and place it on an adjacent table so she could seat a guest. Then those dirty dishes sat there for 30 minutes. Poached eggs on the eggs Benedict were hard boiled. ""Crispy"" capers were straight out of the refrigerated bottle.

Sola is small, cozy, with attentive service and a nice atmosphere. We were very pleased with our dinner here and at the end we decided this would be our go to stop for date nights from now on.

The salmon dip is great if you like lox bagels. The lemoncella champagne is refreshing and the Bloody Mary was good too. The Chile burger was great, different but delicious. The fries are better than Houston's!! The turtle soup was decent, the turtle bits were a bit big in size. Overall, a great experience!

"Two stars because the machines seem to work. That's really it.  I signed up for planet fitness about a year ago after having just temporarily moved to West Philly so of course, I made this one my home gym. That was my mistake for choosing without having actually visiting this location first, because I was unaware of not being able to switch home gyms for a period of time after you sign up. Whatever. No big deal.  I am a black card member and was working on the Main Line so I always went to the Ardmore location because it was just easy to go there right after work. One day, my mom came to visit and she (also a black card member) wanted to go. She knew I hadn't been to my closest location so she wanted to check it out.  The location is very small compared to others, and has limited machines, but it wasn't packed so we continued to check it out. We went into the locker rooms, the floor was sticky. She wanted to use the bathroom but the stalls had not been cleaned. Walking out into the gym area, the floor was still sticky, I guess from people tracking whatever that was throughout the gym, and even some of the treadmills were sticky. It was just one of those situations where I just didn't want to touch anything. Just wasn't for me. I'm not sure if they were having an off day as far as cleaning goes but... nope. The staff is unresponsive... Like they might as well not even be there ever and I wouldn't notice. We left and went to Ardmore.  Needless to say, as far as size, machine variety, staff, and cleanliness, I'd suggest either going to Ardmore or Fox Street -- Fox is the best!",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 2.0

The breading wasn't too thick and the squid wasn't too squeaky and chewy, although it was a little salty.  Then for entree I got the grouper tacos. Some of the best tacos I've had this weekend, they were very flavorful but not too fishy or salty and was the perfect amount of food. We also got the stone crab, which was very flavorful and also not too fishy. Just a little harder to eat then other crab I've had. A medium may not be enough food for one person, depends on how much you eat. We also got the onion crusted salmon, which was pretty good and very fresh but also a little on the salty side.

We also ordered boneless wings and didn't care for the flavor of sauce. We choose the teryaki flavor. Someone else may really like this though, and this was just our personal opinion.

I rented a car from here previously and had to wait 55 minutes at the airport on there shuttle to pick me up along with others.  They said a shuttle would come every 20 minutes but its a lie, be ready to wait up to 55 minutes.     Also this location is open limited hours and they will charge you additional fees if you try to return early.   It would be recommended to stay away from Ace and keep with a rental company onsite at the airport.

"I enjoy eating and supporting the local restaurants but for a third time I have had poor and very poor customer service with Snarf's in Delmar. I wish the owners were more around and monitoring what they have going on because unfortunately Snarf's beats to it's own drum. Besides the attitude received when I've placed orders in the store, anytime they have delivered they have misplaced orders, taken over an 1.5 hrs when they said they would be 30min and most recently ""Will"" stated they couldn't deliver to my home because I only purchased 2 sandwiches and it was $.75 off for them delivering,  so did we want dessert, another sandwich etc.? When I explained we've ordered 2 sandwiches several times before and never had a problem before he said, ""I know not everyone here enforces this policy but I am so what else do you want to order?""  really, that's you're customer service angle to a local customer? Let me know Snarf's when delivering is good for you and you have time for me and my money. In the meantime keep up your great way of serving.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I came here only because I did not feel like sliding down the street to Dierbergs or Schnucks. It was a heck of an icy night and I did not have any of the staples (milk, bread, deli meat, chips, breakfast foods, and booze) in the home. This location is approx 2 blocks from where I lived so I figured I would brave the storm and go. Im  not fond of the meat selection the store carries, the produce selection, or the layout. It does have some pluses though. It is clean, the service is generally always friendly, and they carry my favorite deli ham lol.   But honestly this store chain hasnt been a place to ""shop & save"" at for a while now. The prices are comparable to other grocers. So will it do in a crunch? Yes. Will I drive almost 10 minutes away from where I live to another grocer even though this place is less than two minutes from me..Yes",Business Category: Grocery,Review Stars: 2.0

"Now, if someone is telling me that this place makes the best pizza in Nashville, i would just tell them that they have never had good pizza in their life.   I decided to go here for lunch and try their pizza after reading some of the good reviews here on Yelp but was totally disappointed. I actually ordered 4 fromaggio pizza as somebody in the previous reviews recommended it, but it was one of the worst pizzas i ever had in my life. My pizza was swimming in a tomato sauce and it was difficult to find any cheese on my 4 cheese pizza .. I asked myself whether I really ordered 4 fromaggio pizza as it was difficult to find even 1 of them on mine.   Now you might ask, why 2 stars and not 1 .. well, I am giving them a star because I think I liked the dough .. at least that is what I ate and I am saying I think because I might have actually liked the dough simply because I was too hungry, I am not sure.  My top pizza place in town remains to be Mellow Mushroom  ..

"Tried Naruto for the first time tonight. It's located in a tiny strip mall and is easy to miss if you don't know where it is. The inside is modern and refined, but cozy as well. I was avoiding sugar and carbs tonight so I tried to order healthier options. Had the Hamachi Kama without the sauce. If you have never had this grilled/broiled fish, you need to order it. The crispy skin and soft buttery flesh make for a winning combination . I also ordered a Rainbow or Special Naruto roll? Not sure on the name, but it had Kani, cucumber, avocado, salmon, tuna, and white fish wrapped in cucumber. Both dishes were delicious and I would order them again in a heart beat! Naruto is a little pricey, but I feel like the quality and variety is worth it. I can't wait to go back and try the uni and lots of their other dishes once I can have carbs again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"This was one of my favorite stores...and still is due to their selection, but..  I went in for a facial last week and the lady had me take off my necklace (which had extreme sentimental value)...she even commented on how nice it was. She then draped my necklace over the handles of my purse (which was hanging on a hook on the wall). She proceeded to do the facial...which Included putting something over my eyes for a bit and she got up and walked off.  When all was said and done.. my necklace was not hanging from my purse anymore. I asked around if anyone had seen it... in case it WAS hanging and dropped (I was grasping for straws at that point) and the associates basically said we will let you know if we find it.. yet I had to then ask if they wanted my phone number.  The lady doing the facial didn't seem the slightest bit interested in my ""missing"" necklace...hmm.  As much as I love this store...I won't be returning...as that necklace meant more to me than any other piece of jewelry I had and things should not just ""go missing"" in a back secluded room.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 1.0
"Really enjoyed the upscale, yet casual vibe at Husk. There was a rustic, Southern feel to it, one that I was craving as someone from the Northeast. Was happy to take a break from the touristy spots and Husk, which came highly recommended by locals and friends, did not disappoint.  Our server, Katrina, was personable, knowledgeable, and insightful. She was pleased to offer personal recommendations and provide detailed descriptions to many of the menu items.  Starters: our table of 7 split two dishes. The first was the Cast Iron Pancake; huge portion, more like a cake than a pancake. Delicious, moist, seemingly with syrup cooked into the pancake. The chantilly cream on top was outstanding. Very good. The second was the Pimento Cheese w Benne Wafers. OUTSTANDING. More or less a Southern Tartare with simple, yet elevated ingredients. Beautiful presentation, great flavors, and perfect for the table to sample.  Main: I had the Country Breakfast plate which was everything I wanted in a southern breakfast short of grits. The hash brown was unassuming but absolutely sublime. Sausage delicious. Eggs cheesy, creamy, stellar. Grilled tomato was a nice touch. Peaches on point. Biscuit was nothing to write home about but the gravy was excellent. And if that weren't good enough, the wooden platter presentation took it to another level.   Also had a bite of someone's burger which was damn near perfect. Highly recommend.  I can only imagine what dinner is like here.

"Diamondback Police is cool by me.  I have purchased a couple of holsters and ammo from them. They do have a huge selection of hand guns, rifles, shotguns- both new and used. All kinds of cool tactical gadgets, holsters, cases, safes. Yeah, that's their business to sell cool stuff. But going to the gun store, for me, is kinda like going to a strip club- you're not gonna have much fun if you don't have the money. Well here is what this review is about- great customer service and I didn't spend anything. I went out target shooting with one of my hillbilly biker friends. Ammo is expensive, so I was shooting reloads that my buddy had picked up at the swap meet. (Please insert horrified gasp here) Yeah, I know now. Pretty dumb to shoot reloads from the swap meet.  Everything was going good until a live round jammed my barrel. I kinda felt sick. I mean it's an expensive gun. All I could see was how much this was gonna cost. Oh man, I shoulda used factory loads. Anyway, the smiths at Diamondback extracted the bullet (it was a .40 cal mixed in with the 9's I was shooting. Swap meet bastards!) in less than 5 minutes, and they didn't charge me anything. I guess they knew how miserably dumb I was for shooting those reloads in the first place. But they treated me nice, so Diamondback Police Supply gets my high 5!

Really enjoyed the Fall of Rum beverage.   A very nice blend of citrus flavors and not super sweet.    Could have easily drank 3-4 of them. :)  All the food was solid with nothing being a let down.   I will say this place isn't cheap.   I left stuffed without eating dessert but with a $150 + tip bill.   This included 3 drinks, 1 coffee, 2 pastas, 2 apps, 1 entree.

When my order arrived i had to flag down a employee as they would walk by and ignore me, heaven forbid i want dipping sauce. i get home and the food was CRAP! The strips were not the spicy and were old and dry, the coleslaw was gross and browning, biscuits were salty Yuck, and one bright spot was the mashed potatoes!

"Disclaimer: I am originally from Manhattan, so my view on pizza may be a bit skewed.  This place serves a DELICIOUS pie. It's not by any means New York pizza, but it is sooooo good. It has a taste of its own that I have not experienced anywhere else in Philadelphia since moving here. The quality is outstanding if you order a whole pie. Slices are obviously hit and miss, as they are anywhere.   The rest of the food is what I'd expect for a ~$10 restaurant. They have pretty standard bar / family restaurant food. Nothing strikes me as particularly imaginative, but it's good quality and a good price for those times when we just don't feel like cooking.  Their service can be slow, especially if it is busy. They have fantastic bar specials during games.

I suppose it was kind of worth it because I have yet to find any other middle eastern lunch buffets (and few restaurants in this city, to be honest).   It may just be expensive because it is so close to the mall. Overall, I would done there again.

"I'm not sure if this is the same HOW that was in Clayton, which I used to love, but it wasn't anything special.  Fried rice is what I believe to be a bar, a measurement of the whole menu of food at a Chinese restaurant.  If the fried rice is good, the rest of the menu will probably be good too.  So as a quick stop for lunch, I gave this place a whirl.  All I wanted was fried rice and some crab rangoon.    I've had bad rice and I've had some great rice, but this rice was just there.  It didn't have any flavor, no redeeming qualities.  Not often do I pick through chicken, but it wasn't good at all.  I didn't have any handy, but this rice needed salt at least.  If I was home, I would have to put it back in to a wok and doctor it up.    The crab rangoon?  same thing.  No flavor at all.  My two favorite Chinese food items were a fail at this restaurant.  I'm no health nut, but I try limit the amount of food I eat like this just because of the way it makes me feel.  If the before taste is worth the ugh feeling afterwards, I'll go for it, but it was not worth it here.  Especially having to go back to the office all bloated and lethargic.

"Ridge Bistro is a neighborhood place nestled in a strip mall in ""downtown Harahan""--not exactly full-blown Veterans Highway suburbia, but not quite urban.    The Bistro is in keeping with this setting.  The menu is reminiscent of some of the old downtown eateries from the time when oil men outnumbered tourists in the New Orleans CBD.  There are daily specials, such as a tasty stuffed green peppers with a creative roasted corn side. The ""Shrimp Remoulade Po Boy"" is the restaurant's specialty.  The remoulade, which I tried on a more conventional salad base, is a good one with a nice mustard bite.    The prices are reasonable, about $8-10 for many items.  Service is prompt and friendly.

That being said, I can't believe this place has such negative reviews!!! (sorry)  I ate here for the first time last night and had no complaints. I've never ordered delivery from them or been in when it was busy so I can't speak to that. The service was great, they kept checking on me to see if I needed anything. When I'd finish a glass of wine they'd notice and ask if I wanted another.  The pizza was the best I've had in NOLA, honestly. I got the Queens pizza so it was a ""white"" pizza, with olive oil instead of tomato sauce. The crust was so thin and crispy! I asked for a side of tomato sauce to dip the crust in and the tomato sauce was awesome...so sweet and good.  I've only been to New York once and I don't remember if I had pizza or not so I can't tell you if NYP is authentically New York, but whatever it is I loved it. It was casual, too. I love how us New Orleanians take our food seriously, but sometimes I feel like every place is a tad too upscale for me. Like, I couldn't just walk in wearing sweatshirt and some sweatpants. Sometimes it's nice to be able to do that...here I didn't feel like that would be an issue. I'm not saying it's a dive, but it's just a tad more laid back than other pizza places close by.

"Conveniently located near my hotel, on Canal, and Bourbon Street so I could stock up on Pedialite and Evian before hitting the bars at night.   Don't expect big, friendly smiles from the folks who work there -- they're tired and SO over serving the mostly drunken public, I guess. But you can find a wide variety of supplies, despite the size. I found hair products, hang-over remedies, and a few office-supply items I needed. One stop shop.   You'll pay for the convenience (this place ain't cheap!), but you won't run into as many vagrants here as you will at the other pharmacies across the street.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 3.0
"We had a very unpleasant experience at The Hangar. We had ordered a appetizer(wings) and 2 entrees (chicken sandwich and chicken Caesar salad) they were all very disappointing and we barley ate anything. Our server Savera never checked up on us after our food was delivered to ask how we were doing and if everything was alright, she only came at the end to ask if we needed boxes for all the uneaten food and when we said no she didn't even bother to ask if anything was wrong even though it was very clear that we didn't enjoy our food. She then asked if we were ready for the check and already had it ready in her hand to give to us. Also keep in mind we were her only table and there were only 3 total tables at the restaurant. I completely understand that it's not the servers fault we didn't enjoy our food and we never minded paying for it, it's just the fact there was no regard to make sure we were enjoying our experience or just even to check in on your table. Very disappointed in the food but even more disappointed in the staff. I don't recommend.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I have never been to the other locations of Burger Priest in Edmonton, but when I saw this location near where I live I thought I would take a chance.  First off, Burgers are what I know best. I have been visiting burger joints all over North America and have been pleasantly surprised from different variations and takes of how to make a burger. Usually though, I would never rate a burger from a fast food joint because they are owned by giant corporations. However, Burger Priest looks to be a small chain of fast food joints located in Ontario and now in Edmonton and could possibly be Canadian owned.  The burger joint looks like any fast food place from the outside. The location was quite interesting as it is located in a tiny strip mall in the parking lot of a supermarket. You will need to know the area or have GPS to find this place unless you shop at the market where this business is located.  Walking in there was a nice smell of burgers cooking and a reasonably well laid out floor plan. On the wall there was the story of the Prodigal Son on the left and to the front was where you would order from. Seating was limited and was not full. It is never a good sign when there is no one sitting at a restaurant, but because of the time of day and it being a reasonably new location I took the chance.  Menu looked great, number of burger variations with different takes. The burgers were cleverly named and well described on the menu. My wife asked for a gluten free option which they accommodated at no hesitation.  We ordered our burgers and fries along with a drink. Drinks are in cans and you get to choose yours from a stand-up cooler. Once ordered, you receive a number and you either stand and wait if you are doing take out OR you grab a table and wait for your number to be called.  My wife checked out the bathrooms and said it was clean and that there were no issues. The place was quite clean which I appreciate. When our number was called, grab the 2 burgers and fries and sat down to eat. When I was at the counter I notice that they have fresh patties which they either hand press or machine press. Was very excited to see that.  Burger presentation is simple and that is what I like. It is about the taste and my first bite was great. Lots of juices and flavour. It is a greasy burger, but not overly greasy as some other reviews have said. Fries were excellent, well seasoned and maybe the best fries I have had in the last week or so. All in all, this was a great burger. My wife said the gluten free option was wonderful as well.  If you check out the website or if you are a Burger Priest regular, you will know about the secret menu. Check it out before you visit - looks like there are some dynamite items eat. I think for this place being a fast food burger joint I would score it high. However, if this chain continues to grow I would imagine that some corners would be cut in order to save cost etc. If this is the case, I would then expect that the quality of the food would decrease significantly - but as mentioned in my previous reviews - this is just my opinion so go out and check it out for yourself!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I am really not sold on Tommy DiNic's. While I love sinking my teeth into a massive, juicy heap of brisket on any given day, I don't feel this joint lives up to the hype. I always assumed from the ridiculous line around this place that these sandwiches must be divine. I got the brisket sandwich and felt slightly underwhelmed. While the meat was juicy and succulent, there wasn't a ton of seasoning and the whole thing was just kind of a mess. The provolone was decent and didn't get lost in the mix. Reading Terminal has never been a big hit with me; I've had all the Amish fare back home in Northeast PA and nothing else has impressed me at all. I think the combo of the frenzied crowd and the lackluster sandwich really turned me off from the place altogether.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

I go to Chick fila wherever I am because their principled Christian values as proven and illustrated by their closing on Sundays provides evidence to me that they are not all about the money. With all the expose's over the years of big corporations and the way they cut corners and over process foods to make more money Chick fila strikes me as the kind of company that wouldn't do anything unethical that would jeopardize my health.

"I had an emergency, where I had to get my hair done asap. I went into A1 because they were the only place open (and that wasn't booked full) on a Sunday morning. I showed the male stylist a photo of how I envisioned my hair (slight, loose updo, with very loose curls). He proceeds to curls my entire head Shirley Temple style. Mid-way through, I'm thinking this can't be right, and asks if he wanted to see a picture of the hair style again. He barely spoke English, but he brushed me off and assured me he knew what he was doing. After he was done, I told him, ""No, this is not at all what I want,"" and then he proceeds to ignore my direction and plays with my hair how he pleases. After tearing up in the seat, right in front of him, he starts putting sparkly, pink hair flower decorations in my hair-- as if that was going to make everything better. Bottom line is, I would never ever ever EVER go here again.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 1.0
"And here this whole time I thought Denver was food hell. Lmao. Tampa is REALLY food hell. Finding a restaurant here that lives up to it's Yelp reviews is like finding an honest politician.   Salad was more like cereal as it was drowning in dressing (see picture attached).  Sushi was average and overpriced. Not fresh enough or tasty enough to justify the prices.  Kids meals were skimpy and bland.  Our waitress Really had no clue; every time we would ask her a question, she would say ""hold on"" and she would run over and ask somebody and then come back. Obviously she was brand new. If you are brand new, should you not be working with somebody until you figure it out?That was very annoying.  I've said it 1000 times: Yelp reviews do not tell the true story. You can purchase five star reviews all day long.

The sauce was a little on the sweet side for my tastes (I prefer Carolina styly), but if you favor that type of BBQ then you will not be disappointed.

"Ive been going to egg roll king since i was a kid (mid 90's) their food isn't top cuisine but it wasn't bad at all growing up, i would actually enjoy eating there. Over the years it seemed like the quality just kept going down, not just with the food but also with the up keeping of their restaurant. i would mainly go to the oddie location next to what was once Kmart which i think is their best location. These past few years i catch myself thinking to myself ""why did i buy from here again"" once i enter their doors and get home to open my food. Ive been very disappointed with them but always go back hoping things got better (which they haven't). the food isn't awful and have some highlights, and the people working have always been friendly. i just hope they can get a hold of themselves before they drive themselves into going out of business.  If the owners do end up reading this, please do an overhaul and work on making your locations look clean and updated. the same pictures on the walls showing the food has not changed since i was there in the mid 90's and I'm sure they were there long before i was born. i know this place can do better so please do better as i would love to see you guys in business for many years to come.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"As a traveler who stays at more Marriott hotel properties worldwide than any other chain,  and am in the highest rewards level at all the major hotels,  I can only award two stars,  reflecting below average,  for this hotel.   Upon check in I had to wait 15 minutes and walk the hallways in search of a luggage cart. A staff member also looked for ""the"" luggage cart, but it was not located. Since this older style hotel  has only one elevator, and my assigned room was at the furthest distance from the elevator,  I requested and was reassigned to another room so as not to lug my luggage so far. In fairness, the front desk clerk volunteered on her own initiative to deposit extra reward points into my account.  Shortly after arrival to my room, I  telephoned front desk and the manager answered the phone. I  requested a 2nd coffee maker and was made to feel I was asking for the moon! Housekeeping did ultimately provide me with a 2nd unit.   The laundry and housekeeping staff leave their towel racks, towel & trash bins in the hallways all day as they service the rooms (see photos). So a guest has to navigate the obstacles in the hallway outside the laundry room, and encounter the trash during the day.  I had a service request for maintenance on Friday morning.  Two hours later no one had been to my room. I queried front desk and the receptionist reported that she was alone and all management and maintenance was off-site at a meeting (on a holiday weekend). I asked her if my toilet was overflowing onto the floors would there be anyone to service my room. ....she replied ""no"", as they were not on property and could only leave them a voice message with no idea when they would return.   As others have reported, we had varying water pressure during our stay.

Some of the roasted barbeque meats - duck and pig are pretty good, but the roast pork, roast duck, and soy sauce chicken are too salty and have too much soy sauce. The noodle and rice dishes are okay. The wontons are not fresh tasting with grisly fatty pork hunks. Same for the reopened Ting Wong in November, 2014, which used to have excellent wontons.

It would have been perfect were it not for pre-sauteed Brussels sprouts and pancetta which were soggy instead of the crispy texture they could have contributed to the dish, making it divine.  - Crab cakes - Well made with not a lot of filler, served on a bed of slightly creamed corn.

"I love that they have the exotic meats. They are cooked well and very tasty. I loved the milk shake and iced tea. I'm giving 3 stars because I had cross contamination and got very sick. I have celiac disease and being a known gluten free resturant I had gotten sick 2 times I went there. I had the sweet potato fries and gluten free bun with elk burger and a banana milk shake with unsweetened ice tea and was sick within minutes. I called the General Manager, Eric and told him. He was very apologetic & also explained how his mom had celiac; which was comforting, and explained they have completely separated all gluten free cook wear, grills, toasters, utensils and plates. He explained sometimes it has happened by wait staff or busers not having experience or mixing them up. The only two times I had ever gone of course I had the new server.  Eric immediately refunded me on the 2nd trip.(I didn't know at that time of 1st visit I had celiac disease so I'm not going to take that into consideration although I still ordered the same I just asked for no bun.  I will say that I absolutely did NOT care for the very young waitress, chewing gum and rolling her eyes, who was short & very annoyed that I was asking so many questions. She clearly was completely uneducated about celiac's disease and the true reason behind gluten free: Bu saying ""Like a lot of people come in and like order gluten free and like everyone likes it and stuff"".  I was being me and always overly nice and never saying a word even though I had 100% doubts after that ignorant remark. Especially because it's NOT a ""fad diet""; although a lot of people jumped on the band wagon, it's a life or death situation for true Celiac's.  Well not even 5 mins after finishing my meal I was in the bathroom violently ill and was all day after.   The 3 stars are only for the General Managers excellence in customer service and for being totally awesome sharing he understood, & even shared his personal experience.  I know he can only train, remind, review and go over with the staff & servers so many times. Most should know if working with food the importance and true facts about allergies with food, gluten free, and if using gloves that means not leaving them on while checking on regular bread then putting a salad together.  I too was a young & inexperienced server, but when it comes to severe food allergies. I never messed that up.

We came in unscheduled and Dr. Chuong saw us right away. Despite her young age, Dr. Chuong impressed me with her knowledge and skills. She noticed my mother had the beginning of cataracts in her eye and immediately gave her advice on how to prevent it from getting worse. She recommended my mother get special lenses to protect her eyes from UV light as well as transitions. Dr. Chuong was extremely efficient at her job so the exams were completed very quickly. After that, Dr. Chuong handed us off to her optician Wendy, who continued to provide us with excellent service. Wendy was friendly and sweet. There were an overwhelming number of frames to choose from and Wendy helped my mother and I select the best looking frames and practical lenses without breaking the bank. The glasses I brought in with me were all scratched up and Dr. Chuong suggested I replace the lens. Trend cut my new lenses right then and there and in less than 15 minutes, I had new lenses in my old frames! A week later, my sunglasses came in and I love them so much! They look great, feel great, and most importantly, protect my eyes from the UV light. My mom's glasses are due in any day now and she can't wait to wear them every day.

From personal experience I can tell you it's superior to Annapolis Transit (http://www.yelp.com/biz/annapolis-transit-annapolis#hrid:XiQMin6MSebkLYbmdETbAA/src:self). From reading National Geographic and talking to my worldly friends, I can tell you we Americans are lucky to have public transportation with luxuries like seats, schedules, occasional heat and AC. Not to mention the fact that you don't have to share your space with goats and chickens, or worry about being hijacked by terrorists. Also, our public transit isn't run by the mob and drivers don't skim fares. I took SEPTA for about a year when I lived in PA and while I certainly have my complaints, I can def say that it could be much worse and deserves more than 1 or 2 Stars.   First off, let me address some of the major grievances cited by other Yelpers:  -- Timeliness: have to agree. My bus was frequently late, and not by only 5 or 10 minutes. Thank goodness I didn't have a job where it mattered much. I think the trains tended to be better about this than the buses.  -- Dirtiness and stinkiness: while it doesn't exactly enhance the riding experience, this can really only be blamed on the riders, not SEPTA. If they ever get enough funding to improve the system, maybe they can hire a cleaning crew.  -- Rude drivers: my usual morning driver would actually wait at the stop if he saw me running madly across the four lane highway. The guy taking passes on the train was usually pleasant as well. I really never had a bad interaction with a driver or employee!  -- Confusing and antiquated payment system: it's been a few years and perhaps things have changed, but I do vaguely remember never really ""getting"" the payment system on the bus. There was something weird about zones, and sometimes you paid when getting on, other times when you exited. Plus the train fare system is entirely different from the bus fares. I don't remember anything about tokens. I think any grumbling about this is legit.   I utilized two divisions of SEPTA and here are my brief comments:  -- Buses: Not so great in the burbs. I lived in West Chester and worked at the Exton Mall. I had to take one bus into town and a second bus to Exton. Depending on my start time, sometimes the second bus was a charter/private bus, but the companies worked together. It was odd, but it got the job done. That being said, I never took the bus home because the schedule was ridiculous. I also had to rule out busing from W Chester to King of Prussia because it took way too long. I only took the bus in Philly a couple times, but obviously the buses run with much more frequency and to more places within the city.  -- Trains: my boyfriend took the train into the city every day and I occasionally had meetings in Philly as well. There was only one train stop in the area (near Exton) which was not the most convenient, but I guess everyone got used to it. There was plenty of parking at the train station, the trains were usually on time, you could always get a seat (wider and more comfortable than a bus seat, BTW), and the stops were always announced. My main gripe is that the trains didn't run back to the burbs very late at night, so if we were going out or to a concert in Philly, we'd have to drive. Doesn't make much sense for people to get into the city via mass transit but not be able to get out after peak hours. The major train station in Philly is a little confusing, so pay attention and read the signs. Amtrak and SEPTA share many of the same tracks and stations, FYI.   Random: when we were moving from Pennsylvania to Washington we saw a SEPTA bus outside of Chicago. I have no details to add to the story but we found it pretty funny at the time.  So yes, there were times when SEPTA left me frustrated and angry and made me late and made it difficult to get around the suburbs. But it also got me to work every day and was a vast improvement over Annapolis Transit. When Americans decide to make public transit more of a priority than cars and gas, maybe SEPTA can afford a major overhaul. Until then, I really don't think it's all that bad.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 3.0

"This would have been a 4 or 4 and half lf just based on food which was wonderful. My hard to please wife had lunch Cancun Chimi with shrimp, she thoroughly enjoyed it.  Shimp were freshly cooked and not rubbery at all. I had huevos and churizo which was really good. Key here is to ask for their homemade hot sauce which was outstanding. What brought it down was service. We were sat on bar side away from main dining room . When that happened I was afraid we would be forgotten about,and thats excactly what happened. Very long wait to be greeted by server who was veey friendly and helpful, but once our meal was served , no check back. I wanted more tortillas and a drink refill. Not forthcoming.

"Crepes in the City is a great addition to downtown. We've been there a couple of times and always enjoyed eating there. The crepes are top notch and surprisingly filling.  The setup is a bit strange and takes a little getting used to. They usually have a host who seems to be working hard to seat people and make sure things are running smoothly. However it helps to know what is going on. Just inside the front door is a table with three menus: I don't know why they just couldn't combine the Drinks, Breakfast and Brunch menus into one. Grab those and if a table is available: sit down. Figure out what you want and head to the cashier to place your order. Make sure you get a number on a post and sit down.

"This is your typical Walgreens located in Clearwater,Fl. This store has what all your other Walgreens have including a pharmacy plus they also sell beach items because  the beach is near by.   The place is very convenient if you are heading to the beach and need to stop by to get drinks or anything else or if you are done with the beach and need to come in to pick up items to take to the hotel or home after being done with the beach. It is your normal size store but it does get a bit crowded during the day because it is located so close to the beach. Lines were a bit long and had only one person ringing people up and never called for back up.  Over all Walgreens is a bit over priced compared to other stores but we were near by an needed some energy drinks and water so we stopped by for those items, they do have everything you need here so just for that I gave it four stars.

"After moving into the neighborhood, I scheduled my first appointment with the practice for a Friday, first thing, at 9AM. They confirmed my dental insurance in advance of the appointment and showed off their tech-savvy and automated capabilities by sending multiple reminders via text and email.   On the day of my appointment, I stopped by a few minutes before and they were all ready for me! Even the registration for new patients was computerized (much better than writing all of the information with paper and pen!). Shortly thereafter, I was taken back for my 6-month cleaning / check-up.

Never again. We stayed at Holiday Inn at Elkhart Indiana and were pleasantly surprised. Everything was updated beautiful view and comfortable beds. Coming here was the biggest let down stained shower like dirt had accumulated. I will shower at a friends before using that shower. Hair on the floor and walls. An accumulation on dirt in between the corners so the floors haven't been cleaned properly. I checked the bed for bugs didn't see evidence yet. But found a cheap bed cover and sheet. What in the world is that?!? This is a hotel not a home. You know how many new people will sleep on these beds in a month? Make a long term investment in your business buy a better bed protection. That dinky thing will not protect a bed from bed bugs. They will literally crawl under it. Disaster waiting to happen. I have seen hotels now completely wrap the bed. I thought this must have been a new requirement. Bathroom layout is dark and awkward. The paint and layout looks dingy and tacky. The furniture looked run down. Your better off at a place that charges $40.00 more in downtown. The only thing appealing was the bed covers. Never again!,Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 2.0

"The complimentary valet is wrong FYI as per their website. I'm not sure what I was really expecting.. I've read the yelp reviews and I've looked into the menu, but the goat cheese gnocchi with short ribs just seemed irresistible on the restaurant week menu. So I gathered a few people to come check it out. Most reviews said the steaks were delicious and cooked perfectly and being a steakhouse I feel like it should. However, when I got my black and blue strip steak (it's like a pittsburgh rare, sear on each side for about 20 seconds) there was a layer of carbon on both sides. It was so unfortunate because their steaks were tasteless (they put A1 sauce on the table!!!!) and mine was bitter from being burnt. If they're trying to claim themselves as a steakhouse, they should act like one.   This place only gained an extra star from me because the lobster risotto and the goat cheese gnocchi with beef short ribs were actually good. The gnocchi had just enough goat cheese in it. The calamari was just a-ok, nothing worth mentioning. All the other sides were also plain including the truffle mashed potatoes.   Overall, it's very disappointing for a steakhouse. Also, I'm not sure if it's because we look like a bunch of kids or we were suppose to be there for restaurant week (some of us ordered off menu), but our waiter didn't seem to happy with us. He would rush through our orders and tell us what to do. I'm sorry, I'm here to try to enjoy my meal. Is that too much to ask?",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Okay, keeping in mind ""this is Reno"" (read: Ghetto-ville).   I don't mean that as a snobby kind of person, but the difference between here and Las Vegas is just night and day.  I have never been to Reno until this last weekend and we went mostly to ensure our three young boys have a good time, not for my wife and I.  My preference is Mandalay Bay or Hard Rock in LV - but that is a long drive.  Plus we wanted to be near the snow so the kids could enjoy that too.  Back to my review: this place is adequate for what it is, which is a casino geared towards families.  The kids had a great time at the arcade and midway.  The circus part is just plain lame - the shows are on an elevated stage in the middle of the midway, but there is no raised seating for kids to view.  This leaves me to put my two year old on my shoulder and suffer the resulting back-aches or just ignore the show, which then means they should change the name from ""Circus Circus"" to ""Where the hell is the bar?""  or something like that.   The bright spot was the mini suite - was clean, smoke-free and very spacious for the rate ($119/night).",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 2.0
"We stayed here in November 2020 for a weekend. The hotel was very clean and masks are required throughout. Hand sanitizing stations was located next to all the elevators and entrances. The hotel seems newly remodeled. Our room was great! Staff was very friendly as well. I wish I could give it 5 stars. The only reason I give it 4 is because the hotel had to change the breakfast procedure in the mornings. We usually pick hotels with complimentary breakfast for this reason. However the hotel was doing to-go breakfast boxes. They didn't have any options for gluten free or dairy free food except for the fruit. I usually just eat eggs and bacon but they did not have that option.  Also they charge $10 a day for parking! Which I find ridiculous in a super suburban area with an extremely large parking lot. There's obviously no reason to charge for parking. We paid $450 for 2 nights. It's about 15 minutes away from downtown and State Street. Overall, it's a great hotel.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 4.0

We had to flag someone down to take our order. Then the entrees came piecemeal, with no rice, which we had to request three times from three different people. We had to refill our own water glasses. We had to also ask three times for our cocktails, which finally came as we finished the meal. We didn't get the check until we put our coats on and asked for it on the way out. Host ignored us (turned around and started talking to someone else) when we mentioned the poor service.

"Diners are iconic pieces of Americana. From the sounds and smells coming from the sizzling flat top, to the loud waitresses shouting back and forth trying to get the job done, there's just something exciting about it all. It's pure nostalgia for one, and I don't think anyone can say they don't feel that way when they see one of these buildings restored to it's former glory. Thankfully for all of us, there are a lot of these scattered around the US, and for those of us in Reno, please send some love to whoever originally dropped the Beefy's building right down in the heart of Midtown!    My visit to Beefy's was the product of a perfect storm. A burger craving collided with an incredibly tasty photo of a Setson burger and well written review from Yelper Michael H. Had it not been for that, I would have skipped over this cool little spot for another while, but I firmly believe everything happens for a reason.   Beefy's has all the kitsch and cuteness of a traditional diner. It's small, the roof is low, but it's as comfortable as can be and that's because of the warm welcome from the staff and the friendly patrons. There are some small tables in the back, but I grabbed one of the vintage cushioned stools and sat at the bar.   The menu is small, but complete, with burgers, dogs, sandwiches and a few other things. The names are creative and fun, but the combinations are classic and delicious. Having stared at Michael H's picture for a while, I knew I was ordering the Stetson, a burger topped with blue cheese and bacon, to which I chose to add jalape√±os, and thanks to a tip in Michael's review, I also knew to ask for my burger to be cooked medium rare.  The burger arrived with a great flat top char on the outside, sitting on a nicely toasted bun topped with lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles, schmeared with a little mayo. I added some ketchup and devoured the burger before I knew what had happened. The tartness of the blue cheese, smokiness of the bacon, sweetness from the ketchup, and the spicy bite from the onion and jalape√±os are a marriage made in heaven. My mouth is watering as I type this, and I'm contemplating my next visit.   The one thing I'd warn about here is that much of the menu is a la carte, so your tab can add up fast, which is probably why some have said this place is a little pricey. It's almost $4 to add fries and a drink to any burger, and additional toppings are .75, which to me is a little pricey as well. All of that makes the combos around $11-$12, which isn't bad, but it's the same price you pay for some fancier burgers around town. Add in a milkshake and your bill is going to be around $20 with tax and tip.   But hey, I enjoyed it, and I'll probably do it all again soon! If anyone wants to go, let me know! I'm a fan!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Spur of the moment decision to try Good Stuff Eatery paid off. A much better burger than Shake Shack, GSE's burger felt more like a homemade patty.  Ordered the Steakhouse, Smokehouse, and snack-size fries. Snack-size was basically a regular-size portion. Both burgers were tasty, but the Smokehouse had more flavor.  I do wish, like Bobby's Burger Palace, GSE asked for your preferred cooking temperature...mine was well done (preference for this type of food spot = medium to medium-well), my fellow diner's was medium-rare, and the two burgers at the table next to mine looked to be closer to rare.  Altogether a good experience, with the friendly staff, malt vinegar and sriracha on the tables, and a pretty dining loft. Will return if the quick-burger experience is required.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"We have moved very close to the restaurant when we moved to Tucson and we have been meaning to try it since we moved here. Tonight we went there for the first time and were very impressed. My son-in-law is from Peru and when we go to New York to visit them we eat at or get take out at many different Peruvian restaurants.  We all tried three different dishes from the basic Peruvian Pollo a La Brasa (chicken ) dish , to Lomo Salgado (steak stew ) and Arroz Con Mariscos (seafood platter).We shared a shrimp cocktail before dinner with Peruvian sauce to dip in (it was a nice spicy creamy dipping sauce).   We also had a couple of different type of Pisco drinks I had a Pisco sour and Kathy had a  Maracuya Pisco (passionfruit) to drink. The shrimp cocktail was outstanding as it had a lot of shrimp and the dipping sauce was a little hot but very nice.  The Pollo a La Brasa was exactly like we have had in New York when we visit, but with a little more flavor. I've had the Lomo Salgado a few times and this one was much better than the other ones I have had before in NYC.  Instead  of getting rice and potato I had Quinoa and used a little of the Peruvian hot sauce that they prepare from peppers imported from Peru. Without the hot sauce the quinoa was OK but not great with the hot sauce it was a completely outstanding different dish. The meat was simmered with different types of onions and tomatoes and the broth was very flavorful and outstanding.  Tim had the Arroz Con Mariscos (seafood platter) there was a lot of food. Enjoyed it very much and especially the creamy potatoes that came with it.  Kathy and I split a Flan for dessert and Tim had a stuffed cookie. Excellent flavor on both of them.  The staff was friendly and helpful and especially with Tim who had never been to a Peruvian restaurant before and she explained what the different dishes were and talked about what he liked and suggested the seafood platter. With us,  she just asked what we were interested in and help us along with our order. She and the bartender were very friendly and happy and the service was excellent and perfect.  I can highly recommend that if you like Peruvian food we're never tried Peruvian food that you come here and you will enjoy the food and the drinks. You will also like the hospitality very much. This is one of the best Peruvian restaurants we have ever eaten in in the last 20 years.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"The worst dental experience ever encountered.  The first time I went to the office to research what makes them better/different from other dental programs, no one had an answer. This is a new office in Riverview and you would think they would be more than prepared to tout/sell their program/services. They couldn't even tell me if they accepted my dental insurance provided by the Veterans Administration. A week later and still no answer although they made an appt.  I went there in person an hour prior to my appt and they still hadn't figured it out. I told them to call me upon making the determination and I would leave my house to return 30 minutes prior to appt time.  15 minutes before, no call. I called them twice and got voice mail telling me to call back during business hours...it was 1:45 p.m. Finally got in contact with someone (not from local office) but I was fed up by then. I was even told they had been trying to reach me for over a week but no missed calls plus they didn't want to violate HIPPA laws by leaving a message stating my eligibility. They still didn't have the answer 15 minutes before...what a lousy first impression. I can't imagine and don't want to experience their other processes when is comes to dental work and billing...potential nightmare. Just got a call from the local office (15 minutes after appt) wondering why I didn't show up...corporate offices aren't even talking to local ones...local office totally forgot they were supposed to call me to verify eligibility.

Their tagged pricing policy, offering as much as 75% off on certain color tags is a joke. I guarantee you the predominant tag on items is the tag not listed for a discount that day.  Still like the way they display clothing by color and size and a diligent shopper is bound to find a bargain, especially in the men's section  (shirts, coats, jeans and sometimes shoes/sneaks).  Don't particularly care for the cashiers at all. I guess having the cashiers hovering a few feet above the shoppers affects their ability to be cordial.

"I went to the 50th street location in Beaumont and it was extremely disappointing. I had been getting my nails done for years and have seen the good, the bad and the ugly. Unfortunately this one takes the cake. My nail lady was impatient with me while i was selecting a color and when mentioning I like these two color numbers, she just went ahead and picked out for me. the most mortifying part of my visit was the dishes she used to hold the materials (powders, liquids, etc) were so dirty! There was grim covering the sides of each bowl, some of the grim formed thick layers that looked yellowish-brown (not hygienic at all).  she also didn't use a new file or buffer with me. you could tell the file was old and had been used before but, the buffer was practically falling apart. The edges of the buffer were all crumbled and exposed. Also the dremel attachments were not cleaned properly. upon arrival i assumed that they were cleaned prior to my nail appointment but, after using the attachments on my nails she dusted them off a bit and put them back in the container with the rest of the attachments. after seeing that i realized those attachments she used with me were probably not cleaned before hand.I was soo disgusted, and worry about fungal infections. When finished I wished to speak with a manager and instead she raised her voice at me and refused to give me the managers phone number. The scene she caused was embarrassing and unprofessional. I will not be returning to this posh nails and spa due to lack of professionalism and sanitary reasons.

I got my beer promptly and the server placed my order for a burger and a salad. The salad was big and had some very nice and fresh vegetables in it. At 9 bucks for a garden salad, it was however a tad on the expensive side. The burger was decent and cooked to within my tolerance level.  The vibe was weird in this place. When I went there was a motley crew consisting of some to cool for school guy  with a tailored plaid shirt and sunglasses, some shady hipster/metal looking guys, and a middle aged guy who hadn't gotten the memo about MC Hammer pants being out of style and sporting an Eagles bandanna.

It's best whenever DJ Skeme Richards is there because he knows what to play to get people dancing and I love to dance.  The only reason I am giving a 2 star review is because of how my group was treated last time we were there.  We were bar hopping and trying to get into Walnut Room.  We were stopped at the door because there were too many of us and were told to wait in line.  The cover charge was $10 per a person (which was steep compared to I think the $5-7 covers I experienced before).  Then a girl appeared, who told us that we could all get in if we got BOTTLE SERVICE.  It would have been like $13 per a person + whatever tip for the bottle service that no one really wanted.  I was willing to pay, but not everyone in my party wanted to because they felt like we were getting ripped off like crazy.  We all just ended up leaving.  Even a few people who had been there many times who were in my group said that the place must be going downhill to have to hire a shifty girl like her to run their parties.

She even let me try out a few gel colors before putting them under the light, to make sure I had a color I loved. I love my nails and the color is perfect!

"Awesome little neighborhood spot - casual and fun with delicious sandwiches!   How it works: For dine-in, you order your food and drinks at the counter on the left side of the joint (right next to the butcher/deli area). When it's crowded it can be hard to tell where the line really is so just make sure to ask. After you order and pay, take your number and head over to the dining area. The servers will bring the food out to you. You can also order more drinks and stuff if you want (then close out this bill before you leave).   Came here with a group of 6 so we tried most of the popular items: + Buckboard Bacon Melt - DELICIOUS!!! by far my favorite one! + Cochon Muffaletta - ok, nothing spectacular + BBQ Pork - good + Le Pig Mac - good! The pork patty was so juicy!  + Mac-n-cheese - ehhh, not very good. Would not recommend.  Good for groups and great for a quick lunch!",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 4.0

Come to find out the hold up on the food was they were out of baked potatoes. No big deal either, I am perfectly ok with another side item, but they did not communicate this with us like they should of. Believe me, I'm not a picky eater but I do not like sitting and waiting for almost an hour bc of a simple fix that could have been immediately addressed and been no problem.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Had an impromptu lunch here recently with a friend and we were both pleasantly surprised.  My cafe au lait was well made and thoroughly enjoyable.  The hot chocolate was appropriately chocolaty, though sweeter than I prefer.  The apple muffin was buttery, fresh, infused with apple flavor, and -- rather uniquely -- topped with apple slivers.  I'm not ashamed to admit that I scraped bits of the muffin that were stuck to the muffin paper; you will, too.  Not much of a muffin top on it, though, if anyone cares.  The highlight, though, was the crepe.  There are various savory and sweet crepe options available.  I asked the friendly staff if variations were allowed and my request for an altered veggie crepe was deliciously granted.  The crepes seem to be the thicker Brittany-style crepes, which I prefer to the more-common paper-thin variety -- the better to absorb whatever goodness lies therein.  The mini meal was surprisingly filling so, fortunately, my friend and I did not have to fight over the last morsels of crepe.    The space is nicely decked out, with desks to sit (and, if desired, work) at in the front room and comfy small sofas in the back room, which also has stacks of the New Yorker for your entertainment and/or edification.  So it might not quite be at the level of my favorite creperie (or -- yet -- have on the menu its awesome cafe liegeois dessert crepe with coffee ice cream and chocolate sauce), but it's about two and half thousand miles closer to home than San Francisco's Ti Couz.  Thus five stars.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

You walk around to see caged animals that have been rescued from cages.  Some who can never be released due to the inability to feed themselves.

"On a business trip to Philly, my five-hour flight was delayed two hours (Thanks, United! You still suck!). I didn't arrive until 10 p.m. and, by then, I was dying for a cheesesteak. The concierge at the Westin Philadelphia where I was staying recommended Little Pete's; his standard was ""the dirtier the place, the tastier the cheesesteak."" Gotta trust the locals with the grub.  Two blocks away and ten bucks later, I was happily chowing down on a cheesesteak like it was my last meal on earth. Tender beef, toasted hoagie, cheddar, onions, peppers--let's just say it was 12 inches of winning. Forget Pat's King of Steaks. Been there, done Pat, moved on to Pete.    I'll definitely return to this shabby diner again, even if my flight arrives on-time. For my San Franciscans, there's even a veggie cheesesteak.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

We ordered to go from here last night and it is honestly the best meal I have had from a restaurant in a very long time. Everything they offer is made from fresh ingredients. The lightly fried skamp grouper was the best grouper I have ever had. The blackened red snapper was even better than the grouper. Their slaw and rice and beans were amazing and you can tell it is made from scratch. The organic salad was delicious as well as the homemade squash soup.

"Dear Eaters: On Saturday, May 28, 2011, I placed a take-out from Spampinatos . My husband had called in the order for - fresh caprese salad, antipasto for two and penne siciliano. When I arrived to pick up the order, I walked into an empty restaurant that smelled from last night's ashtray. I tried putting the smell aside to walk over to the bar to pick up the order, but the wafting smell of stale cigarettes permeated my every breath. When I reached the bar the order was waiting in a Plastic Spamps bag. I looked over the order and noticed the the hot penne siciliano was placed on the bottom of the bag, with the antipasto on top and then the caprese salad. I immediately separated the items, but the cheese in the antipasto had already started melting. I asked for another bag for the cold items. I noticed there were two forks and two knives in the bag, but didn't realize until I was on my way that there were no napkins the bag. When looking through the items, I looked again at the antipasto and asked if there was anything but the items in the container that were to be included. There was no lettuce and asked if there to be lettuce. The person at the bar didn't know asked someone else and said that there wasn't anything else to be included. I looked at the antipasto and thought it was rather small for two people. When I arrived home, I started to prepare dinner with the items from the restaurant. The first item that I opened was the fresh caprese salad. This was anything but a salad. Basically it was a few slices of mozzarella cheese and a slice tomato, eggplant, portabella mushroom, artichoke and one slice of italian bread that was soaked in a brown balsamic liquid. The presentation in the container left much to the desired, because instead of being put together, the salad was just a bunch of pieces. I began to re-assemble it to look presentable. The taste was so overwhelming vinegary. And, I love vinegar, but each time I cut a piece of vegetable, it was oozing vinegar. The Antipasto for two people included 4 slices of salami and two types of cheeses which had melted somewhat due to being put on the hot penne silciano. When I tried to serve it, the cheese was stuck together. Four slices of salami and a bunch of small and smaller olives and two sections of cheese and some red peppers strewn on top is not what I think an $18 antipasto should be. Finally, the penne in the siciliano was gummy. Honestly, I could go on, but ultimately, I really thought I was taking out a dinner from a top notch Conshy restaurant that would make for a comfortable, easy, delicious meal. I was left disappointed and hungry. I decided before I was to send this in that I would contact the restaurant. I thought it was the right thing to do before publishing this review, because I understand that small business is how our economy works. But after emailing the restaurant, and having them get in contact with me and telling me that they wanted to get me back as a customer, and that they were going to extend a gift card to me. And telling me that it was in the mail twice, obviously it never came, and in either case, I wanted people to know really what they are getting.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

We chose the omelet with choice of three fillings, home fried potatoes and berries. The omelet was on the small side and the berries turned out to be just one strawberry. The presentation suffered as the plate did not look very full.  The restaurant has potential to be a nice location for brunch with its beautiful decor, nice views and great service.

"I love a good brewpub.  We stopped by Square One Saturday night after dinner.  I had been here a few years ago for lunch and another time for a beer.  Both times, it was pretty good, but nothing I'd need to hurry back for, so I didn't.   It's a cool bar, though, and in the very cool neighborhood of Lafayette Square.   Since my last visit here, I've narrowed down my likes and dislikes when it comes to craft beers.   I'm guessing I had an IPA last time, since for a while I had gotten into a habit of trying those out first.   Since then, I figured out IPA's are about my least favorite craft beers, so no more of that.  This time I tried the Maple Stout, Imperial Stout, Belgian Dubbel and as special brew called Sechtstastic that was created in commemoration of their sixth anniversary.   I loved them all., but even though I just had a tasting of a couple, there was no driving home for me.   So to restate;  I love a good brewpub AND a good designated driver.    Not only was I very impressed by the beers, but also by the selection of distilled products as well.   I only tried a couple, as I'm not a big drinker of hard liquors, but they were both really good.  Sorry, can't remember the names of these.     The servers were very friendly and informative.

It was time to visit a local place I have been meaning to try, but just never got to.  I checked out the Simply Thai website and was happy to see their menu published in a an easy to read format, where I found my favorite appetizer, Chicken Satay, and the noodle dish I was craving. The other great discovery on their website was the ability to order and pay right on line! I went ahead and placed my order, paid and received an immediate confirmation. I also received an email confirmation, both confirmations included an acceptable 20 minute ready time!  I made my way to the restaurant and true to their confirmation, my meal was ready. As my car filled with the delicious smells from the peanut sauce and noodles, I could hardly wait to get home.   I got home and started opening up the meal. Holy cow, it was as piping hot as if it had just been served at my table! Not something that often happens with take out. My meal was wonderful! Generous servings of chicken in the noodles and not too oily. The satay was tender and moist, and the peanut sauce was just the perfect balance of sweet and savory. My first experience was a delight!

"I decided to book a private poker tournament for my buddies bachelor party. first off I haven't attended let alone planned a bachelor party ever, second I have also never played poker. But my buddy loves poker and isn't into the ""traditional"" bachelor party activities. I emailed every single casino in Edmonton and this was the only place that offered private function tournaments. I was in contact with Jason who runs the poker room and he was very helpful and made sure we were taken care of. Wehad to book 4 weeks in advance and could only have a maximum of 30 players at only $10 a head to reserve! I couldn't believe it was so cheap I had to keep asking as I thought I misunderstood. Jason emailed me a few days before to assure me everything was still a go and get a list of players. A few of the guys had to back out due to work but since we still had enough for 2 tables he gave me a refund for the spots I paid for that couldn't come! The room was a big space that was upstairs away from the noise of the main hall. We had a private screen that showed our time, blinds and winning pot. We were even able to choose our own buy ins for the game and prize deals! There was full waitress service throughout the whole tournament. They could have come around more often but they were also serving the rest of the casino so its understandable. The dealers were great. for myself and a few other guys having never played before they were very patient and helpful as to explaining the rules and cards.   Near the end of the game a band was starting downstairs and we happened to be right above the stage so It got a little too loud that we couldn't really hear eachother when we talked which was kind of annoying. And I do have to agree with people saying the place could really use an updated facelift and the waitresses outfits were a little weird. But everything was clean and the bathrooms are all new so it didn't damper our experience at all.  Overall if you're looking for a great private party venue I would highly recommend this place. even the most experienced gamblers in our party were impressed by the level of service and quality overall.

"Atmosphere-Very Nice. The restaurant has a welcoming feel to it. Especially given that it is a more informal setting. Everything looks bright and clean. When you walk in you are warmly greeted by a hostess who explains the process, which involves taking a menu, selecting your order, and going to the counter where the order and payment is taken. You then take a table, where your order will be delivered.   Service-Excellent. Our order was presented in a very reasonable timeframe and the hot food was served hot. On two occasions during the meal, staff members stopped at our table to see if we needed anything.   Food-Very Good. I ordered a caprese salad and spaghetti and meatballs. Both portions were large. The caprese salad was excellent!  The restaurant makes the mazzarella in house and the quality reflects the effort. The spaghetti noodle was bucatini and the sauce was plentiful and tasted great. There were 3 large meatballs, which were dense. I prefer a looser type meatball, but they were fine. Another item that is a matter of taste/preference is the bread that is served with the meal. The restaurant prides itself in offering focaccia that is made in house. It was good, but I prefer traditional Italian bread.   Dessert-Amazing. The restaurant has a great selection of Italian cakes and cookies that were fresh and delicious, as well as ice cream.   Overall Value-Very Good. The prices are very reasonable ($12.50 for a large spaghetti and meatballs) and the food tasted great!  The staff could not have been any better.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"VERY IMPOLITE STAFF!!  Heard so much about this place so just had to try it out. The servers and waitresses are actually very rude. They had this unpleasant face as we even walked through the door. The moment we sat down, they came to us for taking our order.  On asking questions about the dishes, the waitresses (2 of them came together like siamese twins) started making annoyed faces & rolling their eyes while answering our questions. They didn't even answer our questions properly leaving us to still guess what we were ordering. There was no courtesy at all. We were looking for a chicken dish which was more dry . They could not recommend one. Instead were just pointing at the pictures around the menu and mumbling something in English. SO UNHELPFUL. Their vibe was ""how dare you ask me""  The food we somehow chose arrived quickly. They were delicious! We ordered pork and chives dumplings & HK dumplings (shrimp and pork). The dumpling sauce made it taste so much better! The General Tso chicken dish was too sweet for our liking.  We decided to not tip them for their earlier behavior. As we were getting ready to leave, one of the servers opens the check in front of us and points to it saying ""Tip?"" . She actually made us provide tip! I started explaining that we were not at all happy with their service. She just kept shaking her head and saying TIP.  I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED LIKE THIS BEFORE.  They didn't even listen to what I was saying. She literally would not let us leave until we gave something. She even watched me as I added something.   Though the food was great, the service was very poor. I'm torn between never coming back and returning. Hospitality plays a big role and they greatly lacked that. Hence just one star.  I wanted to talk to the owner, but everyone there had a similar vibe. Very disappointed in the staff they hire.

"We played The Hills on Saturday the 22nd and a tournament on Friday the 28th (Hills course also).  The course is in amazing condition considering how bleak our water situation is.  The greens are really nice and the rest of the course is still super green.  If you're a golf enthusiast you'll be very happy with strictly the golf experience.  My struggle with Red Hawk came in other aspects.  First, those damn ""smart"" golf carts.  They are constantly buzzing about something, then inhibiting your speed when you're trying to right the wrong, and honestly the one thing I want to be able to do with the communications portion, they won't let you.  How hard would it be to be able to order food and drinks or even just ask for the beverage cart?  Second, on a Saturday with a tournament on one course and people stacked up every 10 min on the other, how do you only run one beverage cart?  We called several times and tried to locate it with promises they were sending one out. That was on the fifth hole.  By the 13th we finally caught her and the poor girl was run ragged.  Worse yet, there were only half dozen PBR or Miller lites and a couple soggy sandwiches left, nothing truly edible.  Alas, we grabbed a couple beers, waters, and jerky to get us through the last several holes.  When I complained to her she almost cried.  Afraid if I actually complained to someone she'd get fired.  After reading another review it sounds like the weekend of the 22/23 was seriously under staffed for Red Hawk.  I will say my experience on the 28th was completely different, probably because there were two tournaments running back to back that day.  There were people everywhere!  Too bad you don't get that kind of service on a normal golf day.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 3.0

Tacos are roughly 3-4 dollars for one serving each and the portion are god awful, however, the flavor was savory enough to almost make up for it. Boyfriend got the pineapple margarita (again price for the quantity ridiculous) $10 for one, 3 different tacos which were the Al Pastor, Short Rib, and Cochinita Pibil which has achiote pork. He absolutely LOVED the habanero hot salsa on the Cochinita Pibil and says that's his favorite out of the three ""Just the right amount of hot sauce won it for me"". The only downside is the tacos are pretty small, he was able to finish all three in less than 10 minutes. I got 2 tacos, Al Pastor and Baja Shrimp. Out of the two I liked the Al Pastor the most. The pork was cooked beautifully and the pineapple was the perfect touch adding that crunch to every bite.

"I ended up coming to this office as a referral from the Renown ER doctor that I saw. I am one of ""those"" people, who is left without medical insurance for the time being... and this doctors office agreed to see me, only charged me $80 and let me make payments on it. Of course I paid it back in a timely manner, but I was impressed that they even allowed it.  The doctor I saw was very good, and along with my original issue he found that I really AM farsighted. All this time my eyesight has been degenerating,  and it wasn't all in my head. What a relief!! He also found that I have *shudders* cataracts, and said that surgery could remove them and probably eliminate the need for glasses at all. He said we would talk about that on my follow up visit in one month, and discuss doing the surgery on my eyes, charging me Medicaid pricing, and letting me make payments on it. EXCITEMENT!!!  One month goes by, I'm totally excited at the prospect of being able to see again... and BAM!! He decides that I should get glasses instead, and we'll revisit the discussion of surgery, in 1 years. 1 YEAR?!?  Well... no can do! I'm moving in October, halfway across the US. I won't be here in 1 year to have this discussion with him. And as I'm sitting there in his office, he says ""Your vision is effected enough, that I'm sure it's probably really hard for you to drive right now"".   Umm... Ya THINK???  So yeah, he wants me to go get glasses (which I can't do at this time), before I have to drive all the way across country (which I'll be doing half-blind). *sigh* I would have given this office a 4 or even probably a 5 star rating... but how are you going to tell someone one thing, and then turn it around last minute and change your mind, after getting their hopes up? There is no real reason to hold off on the surgery, other then the fact that I don't have insurance at this moment. I DO get that concern... but if that were the case then why would you even suggest it in the first place? I wasn't the one who said ""Oh! I know you said that I can't see well enough to really drive. Would you please do this surgery, charge me a reduced rate, and let me make payments on it??"". Nope. You, Mr. Doctor Sir, were the one who offered it in the first place!  Then to top that off, as I was checking out at the counter on my way out, the lady tried to tell me that I still owed a large balance to them. Umm... no Ma'am. Please check your systems properly before trying to make someone double pay. My bill was paid in full, days before I even went into this appointment. And please don't think to bill me for a follow-up appointment that the doctor said I needed, so he could check the original issue.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 3.0

The employees were idle chatting in Spanish and I looked to be interrupting them. When explaining the sauce she had no idea what they tasted like. I asked if the white sauce was like tzatziki sauce. She said yes. It was ranch. I don't like ranch.   The rice was hard with no flavor, the pita was warmed on top of the chicken. Don't know what the vegetarians do because those should be cooked separate. The chicken was cooked perfect but little flavor.  I expected red onions with middle eastern food.

"While staying at the Marriott Indianapolis downtown, I discovered Conner's as it is adjacent to the hotel. I was looking for a nice, casual yet healthy dinner two nights in a row while I was staying in Indianapolis for a work event. You can enter Conner's through the main street/main entrance or through the back entrance through the Marriott. There's a hostess in the front entrance but nobody in the back entrance. Since I was entering through the hotel, nobody really paid any attention to me and I had no idea who I was supposed to see so I just took a seat. I waited about five minutes and again, nobody paid attention to me so I decided to go to the front of the restaurant and speak with the hostess. She said I could grab any table available. I told her I wanted to sit closer to the bar/lounge area near the Marriott so that my Wi-Fi connected. She said ""no problem."" Again, I took the same table as before and nobody came over to me. I was growing very frustrated and anxious because I was hungry and on a time crunch. Finally, my server, Tyra came over to me and dropped a water and a menu. She was trying to ask me my order but I was on a business phone call by that point. I finally let her know I was going to go with the power salad adding avocado and salmon. The food came out within 10 to 15 minutes and it was absolutely delicious. The perfect portion, the salmon was delicious, everything tasted fresh, and I left there feeling healthy and happy. Also, the prices are ridiculously reasonable for a hotel restaurant. It was so good, I had to return the next night. You wouldn't believe it, but the next night I had the same difficulty. I sat in the same table and got no attention. The bartender was completely fixated on the bar, there were no servers walking around that vicinity, finally I had a server come out to me and I wish I remembered his name because although he did seem fairly new, he was incredible and so kind. He apologized so many times that nobody had come over to me. I went to order the crispy kale salad this time but I ended up with the same salad I ordered the night before. I wasn't going to say anything because I didn't have time to have him put in the order again and he had been so kind to me. The salad, just like the night before was also delicious and so fairly priced. I also tried their burrata appetizer and that wasn't great, I would definitely skip that. The burrata didn't seem as fresh as it should have and everything was sort of overcome with the taste of pesto. Also way too much bread. Aside from that I did enjoy this experience. I would recommend, whether you're dining solo or with a group, enter through the front entrance and talk to the hostess regardless of where you want to sit, if you want to make sure you're not wasting your time waiting around for someone to discover you.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Stopped in at Rippy's with 6 friends mid-evening for some grub.    The food wasn't the best I have ever had, but it was reasonably priced, pretty tasty, and convenient.  I got the feeling that most people who were eating at Rippy's were there because it was in the middle of the bar scene and it was easy - not because the food was 5-star.    We were promptly seated and brought drinks. Our orders were taken quickly, and the food probably took 20 minutes or so to come out - not bad when you have a large group, there is loud live music being played, and the place is packed.   The chicken fingers could have been skipped, and the cheese fries could have used about 10 times more cheese to actually be classified as cheese fries. But the pork loin melt with cheese on texas toast was A-OK in my book.  We added some barbecue sauce and it was the tastiest thing I tried at Rippy's.  The beans were extra flavorful, with some southern seasonings and a spicy kick to them.    For two meals, an appetizer, and two beers, we spent around $35 - not too shabby!  If I were actually going to plan a nice meal in Nashville, I would NOT go anywhere near Rippy's. But, if I was out at the bars and needed some quick grub at a place where I could continue to listen to music and have a beer - this would be the place to do it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

The second time is even better than I remember! before I even Step foot on bourbon street for drinks I made sure to order this to my hotel. My husband said it's the best pizza he's ever had. The bbq shrimp are insane! They should be at a 5 star Restaurant. I would've paid triple the price for this!,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Agree more with the good reviews than the bad. The rooms are a bit small even with the extra bed in the loft. There's not a great way to eat for 4 people. There's a desk with a chair but no real table. So even though you have beds for 4 and a mini fridge and a microwave, there's only 2 chairs. The beds are firm but clean. The bathroom also was clean despite some reviews to the contrary. Room was a bit damp and musty and the continental breakfast was sad Dry english muffins, instant grits and dole fruit cups. Skip it and go somewhere nearby. The location is great. Lula's, literally shares a parking lot with the hotel and was insanely good. Our room was quiet and we had no dealings with the infamous manager of the other reviews, thank goodness.

"I must preface my review by first saying that I have not yet sampled the cuisine at Eastland Cafe.  While I have been in for drinks on several occasions and have sat with people as they dined, I will have to update my review once I have eaten the food.  However, the reason I'm not particularly inclined to sample Eastland's apparently divine food is its cost.  Eastland Cafe offers what the management refers to as ""casually elegant"" food, and what I've seen (brulee and roasted duck, for instance) seems to be about as upscale as it gets in our part of town.  Eastland Cafe is cold hard proof that the East Side is becoming more and more gentrified by the month.  Eastland claims to bring in a great and diverse blend of people from the neighborhood, but it's not much of a blend when all of the patrons are white, middle class 30-somethings who work in graphic design.  Ok, that last bit wasn't necessarily fair.  But that's kind of the vibe at Eastland.  They offer really elegant cuisine, some delicious premium beers and fine wines, and that's what keeps the riffraff at bay.  The servers and bartenders all seem quite nice, and if the food is as good as it looks and smells (and worth the cost), then I'm sure it's superb.  It just seems a bit inauthentic for the neighborhood.    If I was having a celebratory dinner because of a promotion or an engagement or something, this is probably the place I'd want to have it.  Aside from that and popping in on occasion to try out some high alcohol content lagers, this place just isn't my scene.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Good location for when you want a break from touring Nola and still want to stay in the thick of things.  The food is a tad overpriced in my opinion but that's to be expected- though what we did order came in huge portions. The half order mufaletta was as big as my head, and insanely good.  Try the grasshopper daiquiri! And say hello to the waiter boy with big beautiful eyes for me.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I realize that maybe my ""emergency"" was not as important as others' which was why I chose to come to this hospital instead of the other major ones in Edmonton. I suffered minor whiplash injury from a fall and had to make sure that it was nothing more than just that, so was confident that if I needed xrays or other tests, everything is there and can be done quickly. I observed the triage nurse to be very curt, not very welcoming and the least compassionate. Maybe she was tired, who knows. Asked every person to describe what made them come in ""a couple of words"", but asked rudely. But I felt that the moment I told her what my ""emergency"" was, she made sure that I knew I was completely wrong for coming. I get it, like I said I was not in any medical distress, but what she doesn't realize is that sometimes people go to emergency/hospitals because they lack complete trust in walk-in clinics. Yes I could have gone to a walk-in but I would not have the peace of mind. For me, I know I wouldn't even get the same quality of nursing care at a walk-in clinic. Even if I got seen by a crappy ER doc, at least I get access to great nursing care. I sat there for almost 2.5 hrs, patiently waiting until it was my turn accdg to triage, because I knew I was gonna get better care than at a walk-in clinic. Be mindful of all the ""whys"" each patient comes to emergency for, because if emergency nurses knew how important their role is to patients, they would feel really proud that patients come to them instead of going to a walk-in clinic, no matter how small the issue is. But this is why our health care system is so broken, yes you get free health care but for what? So you can get sub par care by primary practitioners who more often than not misdiagnose illnesses? But that's another review for another day.... until then.",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 3.0

"Because we are living in such trying times, firearm sales are through the roof! Demand is high, so like practically every gun shop out there, the Tampa Arms Company's inventory was a little light. That said, TAC is well stocked in expert knowledge and excellent customer service.   I greatly appreciated the help Cole (the owner) provided. He listened carefully to me as I explained what I was looking for in a firearm - a home defense pistol that I wanted to eventually conceal carry - not too big, yet not too small. He was super patient with me as I asked a ton of questions. He took the time to show, demonstrate and explain the differences of various models.   Based on my requirements and with Cole's help, I narrowed down my choice and I made my purchase. As I said earlier, demand everywhere is high, so I already expected to paid a little bit more than I would have liked, but I'm not complaining. I would have happily paid for the knowledge that Cole provided.   The Tampa Arms Company - great shop. Awesome people.

"My family, a party of six, went to this restaurant, for the first time, on April 18th.  We did not have a reservation.  It was quite busy.  We told Michael that we were a party of six.  He told us they would be getting a table ready.  A waitress motioned to my husband to follow her.  We followed, she stopped and talked with another waitress.  The waitress came to us and told us our table was NOT ready and we had to go back to the front.  After waiting 10 minutes and Michael sitting people as they come in, a party of 8 came in without a reservation.  Michael told them they would be seated right away.  My brother went to Michael and told him that we had been sitting patiently thinking we were going to be seated.  But Michael continued to seat others and that we should be seated before the party of 8.  Michael showed major attitude, turned around and walked off.  Next thing we know we are being seated.  Because of Michael's attitude toward us, our mood had soured.  The bright note:  Sheena was our server she was excellent.  The food was GREAT.  The swordfish was cooked to perfection.

"Stayed here recently on a family trip to Santa Barbara...As many others have stated, the place is somewhat outdated, but overall the hotel was clean and the beds were comfortable...Those are the two things that are a must for the wife...Price for the stay was comparable to others in the area ,unless you are trying to stay at motel 6 or something...There are some high end places to stay in the general area if that is what you desire, but the price is significantly more expensive ( double the price ).. .The front desk person ( Anthony ) was awesome... He is probably the main  reason I will be back to stay at this location... He was accomidating in our request for a room near the pool, and went out of his way to make our stay a good one...Good guy with a professional attitude...Hotel is one block off of the freeway at the beginning part of State Street... Located somewhat close to several reataurants and businesses, but this is not the area of State St. where you would be close to the beach and near all the higher end shops. That would be at the other end of State St. and a few miles away. I plan on staying here again on my next trip out to this area based on my interaction with front desk staff, its location to freeway, and also my experience on this trip...

"Good things about Sam & Zoe's:   location - not another coffee shop anywhere nearby mocha - my favorite in Nashville - a perfect blend of coffee and chocolate bagel with cucumber cream cheese - sooooo yummy packaged sweets & treats - you can't go wrong with any of them free wifi - 'nuff said open on Sunday - yay!! I am very excited about their new Sunday hours!  Not so good things: service - the staff is a bit gruff, and the drinks are usually served with a side of ""i'll get to you when i get to you"" - the owner never seems to be there and the one time I did see him, he was really friendly which was almost jarring since it was so unusual! parking at lunch - obviously Baja Burrito takes over the parking lot during this time and it can be difficult to get a parking spot patio is smoking and unsightly - bongo java has a non-smoking patio section which is the only place to enjoy coffee smoke free outdoors in the warmer months.  also - why did they start using their patio as refrigerator storage?  It's like a stainless steel graveyard and not very appealing when you walk in the front door.  All in all, I like Sam & Zoe's but I'm laid back and I think it's good for the price.

"I rarely write reviews, but felt compelled based on a review from a guest that dined the same night as my family.  On Friday, I randomly stopped in based on a yelp search, but had never heard of the restaurant.  I ordered a salad and pizza to go.  Five minutes went by and seems the kitchen made the wrong pizza so the management proactively came over to apologize and let me know that it would take another 5 minutes to get my order.  I thanked them and laughed as 5 minutes was not very long to wait anyway and I appreciated the heads up.  They offered me a beverage while I was waiting and within another 5 minutes my order was ready to go.  When I got home I told my wife I had never met such responsive owners and I wanted to take her and the kids for dinner.  The takeout pizza was very good and my daughter really enjoyed it.  The salad was fresh and very flavorful. It was good enough to take my entire family to dine 2 days later.    The owners recognized me and we joked how it took me so long to come back (a whole 2 days).  They introduced themselves to my wife and kids and we were promptly seated.  Our waiter introduced himself and was extremely nice and knowledgeable.  He did let us know the kitchen was backed up and would bring us bread right away while we waited.    My kids both had pizza and really enjoyed it.  My wife had the tuna and it was cooked perfectly rare.  I had the bronzino and it was fresh and came with a perfectly flavored side of sauteed spinach.  I am always hesitant to order seafood on a Sunday, but our entrees and even the octopus were really good.  Yes the food was a little slow on this one occasion, but the proactive notification by our waiter made up for that and we enjoyed our wine and each other's company.  We will definitely be back and even bring my in-laws.....that says a lot as they are hard to please.

I placed  my order so they would arrive in time for an event I had planned. When I replaced my order with a comparable/same price/same brand they would not expedite the shipping unless I paid for it. The cigars arrived after my event because of their delay.  Three weeks later my original order, which they never cancelled, arrives with an invoice (how convenient). Now I have to call, wait on hold, explain, repack and ship back their wrong order. No comps or credits for screwing up.

"This may appear as if I'm writing a review for Payless rent a car--but I'm not..  This review is for ACE RENT A CAR, in Tampa, FL.   We had made a reservation via Orbitz on 12/12/12, for a 12/15/12 reservation. Quoted a $60.94 price for Midsize/Nissan Sentra sized car.   From Airport--I actually had it in my head that we had rented through Payless, so I got on the shuttle from airport to Payless. I arrived @ Payless--they don't have my reservation--I was upset.   Dingbat! I'm at the wrong place. Kind man said it happened to another renter, and so I called ACE and asked if they could pick me up at Payless. THEY WOULD BE HAPPY TO! They came in less than 5 minutes!  I check in, and the guy asks if I want to get a bigger car (Honda Accord)--I said no--because I'm from Chicago--and I LOVE small cars--AND I don't want to pay more-I'm thrifty! He said it's cheaper ($56.04)--and THAT I like!   He asked me if I wanted to rent a GPS.. (everyone upsells, Ok?) I said No Thanks. He gave me directions to get to Tampa.   Only downside: He gave me the car keys & the checkoff list to find any dings. He did not say where the car was-only the keys said ""Grey/Toyota"", so I was aimlessly walking around the lot (kind of small actually). I got frustrated and almost walk back in, when I see the car.

"I am utterly disappointed with this establishment. Last night I ordered a large pizza online at 10:20pm. The hours of the location said that they stayed open until 11pm. My card was charged and I received an email that my order would be ready in 15-20 minutes. I drove to the location and got there around 10:45pm. When I got there I tried to call the restaurant multiple times but no answer. I go up to the door, and they are CLOSED. I never received my pizza but was charged anyways. I called the restraunt today and spoke with them about my issue. Luckily I will be receiving a refund for the pizza I never received from corporate. I asked the employee I was on the phone with what there hours were on Saturday and they said sometimes they close at 11 and other times they close at 10:30. I just feel like that could be really problematic. If they want to close at 10:30 than they need to update their hours on their website. I will not be returning, until they fix their service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I only frequent this place during the fall for the ""fall activities"" aka pumpkin picking, hayride, and corn maize.   Don't come here thinking it's comparable to Linvilla because it definitely isn't.   This is a much smaller farm and more accessible than most other farms in the region. It is an ideal location as it is near 295 and the bridges.   A few years ago, their onsite parking was a bit of miss for me. The spaces were extremely tight and of course my car got a dent from a door hitting my car. They do offer parking across the street which isn't that full. But walking across springdale might be a deal breaker to slow walkers (seniors, children, etc). This year i saw they kinda began renovating their parking lot. I'm not sure if they are going to add asphalt or keep it ""farm chic"" by leaving dirt and rocks..i hope not because its just too dusty and muddy.   They definitely need a better system regarding buying tickets for the hayride and maze. Perhaps add a cash only line outside of the building ? We waited almost 20 minutes for tickets. The line for the hayride wasn't that bad either. They have fall/festive boards where you can pose for pictures like most places.   The tractor driver was pretty nice and let my group take photographs sitting on the tractor. The pumpkins were plenty. The corn maze was actually very difficult this year. SO much so, that we quit half way through! But a person in my group was sick, so walking around in the sun wasn't her idea of fun.   The market was, as everyone mentioned, a bit pricey. I wanted to get a pie/cake for my family but felt unjustified in spending almost $5 more. Yes, i would love to support local, farm fresh places, but times are tough for everyone!   They offer corn maze at night too, which i think would be fun with a group. probably even more difficult!",Business Category: Home & Garden,Review Stars: 3.0

He only had enough for half a glass and it was lacking any ice. He walked away and didn't return to fill it or bring the needed ice.

"What a pleasant store! Every worker I ran into was smiling and every single one asked me if I needed help or if I was finding everything ok. Workers were out actually working- stocking shelves and helping customers! Some stores you see employees hanging around talking or smoking cigarettes out front (yuck!). Not here.   We came to set up a registry. The woman who set us up was so nice. My only complaint was that their gift bags suck. You get one diaper and a bunch of advertisements. How about a bottle or something more useful?  One male employee approached my husband and helped us pick out a stroller, car seat, and helped us find an adapter kit. He also helped us pick a rock and play. Really nice, helpful and genuine guy!  The employees here are very nice and knowledgable. I love this store. A+ for customer service.   However, when I left, I had to use the restroom. I accidentally walked into the nursing room and was shocked to find there were several pungent deodorizers in there. That stuff is toxic to infants, BRU! Please remove them from the nursing room! If the place is clean, you shouldn't need toxic scents to cover up bad smells. Also, the bathroom wasn't the cleanest.

Shortly after that, all but 1 drink was on the table, it took a while for the mixed drink to be ready.  Our food was ok, nothing great.  We had the cauliflower app and their ""award winning"" meatballs.  The cauliflower was good, but the meatballs were very mushing tasting.  Entrees were so so.  The pasta served with the shrimp scampi was completely overcooked and mushy.  They did give us 50% off that entree because of the pasta.

"I visited on Sunday 3/22 @ approximately 4pm. The store was past legal capacity. There was no where to go, every navigation option was clogged with people. Trader Joe's knows how to handle capacity, they shut the doors when they hit max and they have a single line that they sort people to checkout stations from. While this may not be the optimal solution, at least manage your capacity. Next time this happens I will call the fire Marshall as this is a fire hazard. I use a mobility scooter and was forced around in circles to find a way to get through to the checkout lines. There is only one accessible checkout in the middle of the store, it was unnavigable. Even the South street store has more than one checkout that is accessible by a scooter and a cart side by side, your layout is not reasonably handicap accessible. I am guessing it meets the needs of all your able bodied designers but it fails in function. Your staff often ignores handicapped individuals in the store to the point if invisibility. I was struggling to reach for something on the top shelf, an employee at the dairy section looked right at me from less than 3 feet away and turned as I asked clearly for help. This is typical behavior. At least at Super Fresh, South Street Whole Foods, Trader Joes and DiBruno's they have employees roaming and engaging to help all patrons including handicapped individuals.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 1.0

DO NOT DO NOT GO HERE!!! I came in to this dentist with a tooth that needed to get pulled.  He was drilling into my tooth and has ice cold water blowing on my teeth to keep the drill cool.

After he drills 2 holes in my mouth and chips half my tooth off this clown tells me to go to another dentist. So I was frantic to find another dentist before the freezing wore off.

"IMA comes with a bit of a sticker shock for a single day admission. On its face, it seems expensive as it is right up there with some museums in Chicago. The catch there is other museums charge for specific exhibits but once you're in the IMA, you're good to go.  If you go at least twice a year, you should just spring for the $75 membership. You also get discounts for special events and a few other benefits as well.  IMA is a beautiful facility and have really done a lot to modernize over the past few years. In addition to the current Audubon exhibit, the IMA also has mini golf and a beer garden. You can explore the nearby greenhouse while drinking beer or wine. Or enjoy a King David's hot dog or some great iced coffee. And considering you're at a museum, the prices aren't marked up too much.

I'll cut them a little bit of slack because they were going through a remodel when I stayed here.. had to wait 10 minutes for the elevator every time I needed to go somewhere. Aside from this, the hotel is just old, the rooms are outdated (from my understanding they aren't remodeling the rooms). The carpet looks like its from the 1970s in the rooms. I couldn't get the heat to turn on properly. Just highly disappointed with this being qualified as a Sheraton.   The staff is friendly and helpful, that's why I'm not giving it at 1 star review.

"Over the years I have gone to this facility for various reasons as well as their other locations for reasons ranging from emergency room visits to surgery. All my experiences with the medical staff have been positive.      However, their billing department is composed of a bunch of infuriating incompetent zealots. They start dunning you for payment by telephone before they even send the bill. And the phone calls as well as the return number is a computer. You do not have the option of talking to an actual person. To reach a live person, I had to call the hospital and request to speak to a live person in billing. As usual, they apologized for the computer system, but quickly added that they have no control of it.      So, should you use their facility, expect good care.

"I would say Scotty's is a 3-star type of place on a good day. Today was not a good day. I met up with my wife and a couple of her friends after an event downtown. I was excited to try Scotty's for the first time. I liked the atmosphere and there were plenty of TVs showing basketball, but that is where my positive impressions of this place end.   Maybe the event my wife and friends went to made them busier than usual. Which is why it took 10 minutes to be greeted, 5 minutes to get a Coke and menu, 25 minutes for a burger and slightly above room temperature fries, 20 minutes for a to-go order, and 10 minutes to run a credit card. Normally I don't watch the clock so close, but I had to feed the meter a couple times beyond the hour I bought at first. But, I am afraid service speed would have done little to improve food quality.   Tip- If you like nachos or variations on nachos, stay away from Scotty's version. It was a pile of fairly fresh chips with salsa, fresh jalapenos, sour cream, government cheese, beans, and crumbled up pieces of a hamburger patty. Yes, crumbled up pieces of a hamburger patty.

"This is probably my new favorite restaurant in the area. I would've given them 5 stars except my entree came out luke warm. I think they planned poorly and mine was finished before my sister's was and they came out at the same time. Otherwise, the food and experience was great.  I've been here in the past and it was definitely a 3 - 4 star experience then, but yesterday the food was just that great. Maybe I just ordered superbly, so maybe I should get that last star. I'm a super star.   Anyway, the complementary bread is great. No complaints. You get three times, some type of cranberry nut bread, a thicker moist brownish wheat or something bread, and a hard sourdough style bread. All great for dipping if you order an appetizer or main course with dippableness.  For my appetizer, I ordered the escargot. It was probably the best pot of snails I've ever had. Generally when you order snails, they come drenched in heavy oily butter and/or cheese, which kind of leaves you feeling a bit disgusting. The snails here came in a lighter hazelnut butter with a lot of garlic and three slices of croutonish hardened garlic bread. The snails were extremely tender and the butter flavorful without being heavy. It ended up being heavy only because I took the previously mentioned table bread and started sopping up the butter sauce. I felt so disgusting afterwards, it was marvelous.   By the time my entree came out, I was pretty heavily gorged on bread and garlic butter sauce. Like I mentioned at the start, my beef short ribs came luke warm. It was off the bone already, but the meat was tender and flavorful, perfectly cooked. The mashed potatoes and compliments were all good as well.  My sister had the steak frittes, medium rare. This was cooked perfectly also and had a great garlic butter type of spread on top. The flavor was delicious. The side that accompanied it was fries with some sort of dipping sauce which worked out well also.   All in all, the food was amazing, the experience was great, the problem was just the luke warm entree. I didn't care enough to send it back, im sure they would've heated it up, but I was so full I only ate half anyway.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Went here for the first time tonight.  Had the bouncer charge me $5 to ""hold"" my hat, because ""flat billed hats aren't allowed"", and ""there are a lot of hats to keep track of"". I felt like I was in Vegas for a minute, except we are in TUCSON! I laughed as I gave him the 5 bucks and he put it in his pocket, so i asked if he knew how pathetic it was to shake people down for 5 dollars. I got no reply and a dirty look, BUT, I made it in.   On the plus side, watching sports on the TVs would be cool during the day. Also, according to my lady, the dancers on the bar in the semi-sexy outfits were hot, too....   Oh, food ends at 2300 on a Fri night.  I was super hungry and security outside told me I couldn't go to Gio Taco and come back w/o standing in line. I offered him $10, and he said ""for $10, I can do that, just come find me and I'll get you back in.""  Overall, the girls aren't so hot as to make me forget I'm in Tucson. 1* for the bullies on roids,  5*s for the TVs and open patio. 3*s for the Almost-A-Strippers that twerk on the bar.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Ok so u tryed 83 diff beers, na not around here yet, then the prices were lowered....we'll see how that works( daytime ) any how, keep in mind, I of all people want use to do well. Better for our area. Please!! separate the bar from the tables somehow, makes me feal uncomfortable.the dinners don't wanna look at a bunch of drunks either.Many others I've talked to share my opinion. Agiain only my opinion, Since I am a local, need to know stuff is fresh if I'm gonna stop in, now this is just ME, and well? Idk. Back to bar patrons and dinners on top of each other. Maybe a wall or some type of separation for the two areas would go far. Finally I don't mind paying 8-9-10 dollars for a top shelf screwdriver if it's a good one. So..please make it so.

"Stopped in to treat my Daughter to their $1 fried shrimp which are absolutely DEEElicious!!!   Parking: street  Atmosphere: It's a bar. No ambiance! don't focus on the look of the place just head to the walk up window.  Service: Bar opens at 4pm week days. You walk to the back of  the bar to order at a little walk up window. The guy who helps you name is Alex. He's cordial. I have only had their fried shrimp and as I stated, they are delicious: fried & seasoned just right!  Alex will give you a slip to pay at the bar if you are using your bank or credit card.   They offer sauteed shrimp for $1 on Tuesdays only. I heard there food is good. On Mondays they have a buffet starting at 7pm  (I believe) for $7. I am going that day so I can try their items.  They have a pool table if you have to wait for food or you can always get a drink.

"I purchased a private Rocky Tour, my wife is a huge Rocky fan.  Trevor was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!    He picked us up on time from the AirBNB my family had rented, it was a nice Town and Country Minivan, and we felt like we had plenty of space.  Trevor had a very relaxed, easy going nature about him - to boot he was extremely knowledgeable on a wide variety of topics.  Everyone in our party of 6 learned something that day.   He was attentive to our needs and made adjustments as needed (food, bathroom).  It was the best way to experience the city.

The sauce was a little more runny than I'm used to, & the pieces of chicken were also smaller than usual. It was still SO good, & my picky son ate it.

"Will never come back here again. First thing, they never have a supply of toilet paper and paper towels stocked in the bathroom. The last few times I've gone there with friends, the bathrooms have been completely out. And second thing, the main reason for the one star (if I had an option it would be zero) is when a friend and I were waiting in line to use the restroom, a girl came out of the bathroom and told us that there wasn't any paper products left in there. Note, it was only 11pm and it was really dead in the bar. While she was telling us, and employee came up to us and said that we can't be going to the bathroom in groups cause there's people waiting, etc. There was no one else in line besides us and so we explained that we weren't going in a a group and that we needed toilet paper before we go in there. He REFUSED to listen to us and started to walk away, so my friend nudge his arm saying that we need paper products and that's when he turned around, had his hand on her throat, and dragged her out of the bar. He used unnecessary force on a female for NO reason. At that point, we were only on our second drink so we weren't even buzzed.   Like I said before, never coming back here again. I'll take my business somewhere else where they won't choke out customers.",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 1.0

My husband ordered the prime rib with creamed spinach, and I ordered the small fillet with sweet potato puffs ( think tater tots!!). Our food was delicious. The salads came with homemade dressing and fresh croutons. We were too full for dessert but I did have the blackberry sangria which was tasty. I'd definitely return to this restaurant.

Not much char on the steaks-almost seemed like the grill needs to be cranked up more.  Servers were attentive and the owner came out and introduced himself and checked on us throughout the meal.

"I would rather give this store 0 stars if possible. After a drawn out and confusing process getting our sofa purchased we finally did. My husband and I had recently closed on our house and like another previous reviewer had scoured over 7 stores to look for the exact sofa for our family room. After making our custom sectional purchase on 9/8 and being told that there would be a delayed in shipment "" due to covid"" my husband and I practiced patience and chose to go forward with 3k+. Well now we are 4 weeks past our initial delivery date of 11/13 and I just woke up to another automated email that our couch would not be complete until January 11!!!!! Over 4 months of production time to make a sectional- that is ridiculous! Absolutely no communication or updates from the store and when I call it is blamed on "" covid"" and no further explanation. They need to be more transparent with the customer and not give a last minute notice when they plan to delay it. I have a feeling this will not be the last delay in delivery so plan to cancel the order as soon as the store opens this morning and go with a more trustworthy company. Do not bother placing your furniture order at this store. I have had several other pieces in my home from Ballard design, Ashley furniture etc. that have had "" covid delays"" in production but still come in a normal delivery time not OVER 4 MONTHS!!! We are now officially through the holiday season without our main piece of furniture due to a team guided on closing the sale ($$$) but not actual customer service or product!!",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 1.0

If you're buying raspberries in November folks, they didn't come from anywhere around Philly. Some days, though, you just need a sushi snack after hitting the art museum. As far as Whole Foods locations go, this is one of the better ones because it's really large and spacious, unlike my tiny co-op. Also, the prepared items seem to be more extensive here. I like that Whole Foods carries Ceres juice, something I fell in love with while living in South Africa. As much as I loathe the prices, who else carries the flaxseed meal I need for my vegan cookies?

"I really liked this place immediately.  Perhaps it was because it was the first place we went to when we got to Nashville (other than the hotel, of course), but I'm pretty sure my immediate love was justified after we got settled in.    The huge patio outside is fantastic and when I realized it was pretty chilly inside, I knew there were more than enough reasons to request seating outside. While we were waiting, we hit up the bar and I learned that I was a mere 3 days away from the pumpkin ale debut and I would be heading out of town that morning. Sigh. I tried the standard wheat ale after the saddening news and really enjoyed it! It was delicious and not too plain, considering the type of beer it was.   When we got seated, the only thing I can complain about is the height of the chairs in relation to the table. I felt like I was falling...hard! It's like when toilets are surprisingly lower to the ground than standard ones. That aside, everything from there on out went wonderfully. Our service was great and though I was torn between a few menu items, the hazelnut chicken was probably the best decision I could have made. The hazelnut wasn't overpowering and the mashed potatoes were creamy and perfect. The roasted cherries were a perfect touch to the nutty, meaty and cheesy flavors in the dish. I couldn't have asked for a better first meal in Nashville!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"This Italian restaurant is my absolute favorite in Philadelphia. I made reservations here for my 22nd birthday because I just had to have their Rigatoni Alla Vodka to celebrate. Their food is excellent, drinks are amazing and service is on point. The dim lighting and candles make for a really romantic, cosy ambiance - I highly recommend this joint for a date spot.   As I mentioned, the Rigatoni Alla Vodka is a hot favorite of mine - the rich delicious vodka sauce topped with some spicy fennel sausage makes for a very hearty entr√©e. Their Wild Mushroom Arancini Crispy Risotto Balls are also UH-MAZING - the crispy outer layer and decadent truffle filling are sooo good. If you're a truffleholic like me, get it as an appetizer. Amongst the desserts, the only one I've tried is the hazelnut cannoli - the creamy hazelnut filling was delicious (might be a little too sweet for someone who doesn't have a huge sweet tooth).

"We've been owners of Worldmark for nearly 16 years, but this was our first trip to Avenue Plaza. We booked two studios -- one for my husband and I and one for our friends traveling with us.  The studios were furnished nicely, had kitchens, but no adequate mirror. The only mirror was the tiny mirror above the bathroom sink. To see myself fully dressed, I used the mirror out in the hallway by the elevator. Yeah, that was weird but it wouldn't prevent me from staying here again.  The staff were overwhelmingly friendly, genuine and appreciative of us. Each morning, we received a ""Good morning"" when passing the front desk. Upon return in the evening, we received a, ""Hello"" or, ""How was your day"" or, ""How are you?"" All four of us literally felt like we were royalty simply based on the consistent friendliness we encountered. It was noticeable and appreciated.  If what happened on our last morning could be erased from my mind, I'd give Avenue Plaza 5 stars. However, our last morning was not good. As Worldmark owners, our checkout time was Noon. For everyone else, checkout is at 10:00 a.m. Since it was our last morning, and our flights left in the late afternoon, we wanted to take this morning to sleep in and really relax in bed for the first time since we had been go-go-go for 4 days. At 9:45am we had a knock on our door from a housekeeping gentleman asking us when we planned to check out. My husband told him Noon. He thanked my husband and walked away. Around 10:30am, there was another knock. I answered this time. A housekeeping lady asked when we planned to check out. I asked her why she was the second person to knock on our door, and she just apologized. I told her we'd be out by Noon. Then, about 11am, we received a phone call asking when we planned to check out. My husband told the man that checkout time was Noon, so we'd be out by then. At that point, we both decided that they really wanted us out of there, so we packed everything up and left. It was hardly a relaxing morning with staff trying to get us to leave well before checkout time.  Even given this, I'd stay here again, but at the start of my stay I would impress upon the staff to NOT bother us and pester us to leave the room on our last morning well before checkout. There are no ""Do Not Disturb"" signs for the doors, so I see no way around this other than to inform them ahead of time to stay clear of our room. I may actually bring my own sign to hang on the door on the last night. Other than that, I recommend this hotel -- well located right on the St. Charles Streetcar line and next to several eating options -- Cheesecake Bistro, Trolley Stop cafe, Igor's (a laundromat and bar) and a few pubs (Avenue Pub is good!) down the way. It's only a few block walk to Magazine Street as well, which is a great spot for a low-key stroll past the mansions of the Garden District.  Stay here.

So being that embassy is the beginning of our adventure...check in service was less than adequate!! We booked a premium two queen suite months in advance!!

About an hr later we received all the complimentary goodies that we paid for. It was awesome, I'll give it that! But I just couldn't get over the check in experience.   I travel for business a lot and usually I would have an excellent experience. Although being that this is a leisure trip with my family, I expected absolute comfort and accommodation that it truly lacked here. I just wish they were a bit more professional than what I received.

"Came in on a Tuesday night around 6:45PM and made a last minute same day reservation for 3. We were accommodated rather quickly.  We ordered 2 apps: the cheeseboard and steak tartare, both of which were scrumptious. The cheeseboard was very dainty and fancy: 6-7 types of cheeses spread around an array of blueberries, sliced apples, sliced peaches, thyme, jam and crostinis (baked slices of small bread for you to spread the different cheeses and sample). There is also a legend for you to learn about the cheeses and its origins - you'll see a cute one in a mouse shape. The steak tartare was great: comes with housemade crisp potato chips and a mashed boiled egg, pickled onions. We cleaned both plates!  For the entree, I ordered the scallops which were so tender and nicely charred on a bed of arugula and butternut squash noodles and sliced peaches adding a nice sweet touch. I loved it! My coworkers ordered the sweet and sour halibut and the lovebird fried chicken - also finished up their plates.  Overall, the service was good and attentive. It'd be a nice place for a moderately priced meal since it has delicious food and great ambiance though I do think it can get a bit loud for an intimate date...if the weather wasn't as humid, eating outside might have been nice.

The baked beans were ok - nothing to rave about. The cheesy corn was good, but I think I would have preferred a good Mac and cheese instead :) the cornbread was awesome - very moist and I like that there were little pieces of corn within the bread. They have a set of 6 BBQ sauces at each table which is pretty cool. They all tasted pretty good but I think I ended up sticking with only 2 of them for my meal.

"2013/053  Finished a job earlier than expected downtown and my stomach cried for lunch, even though it was only 10:30. I remembered this from Yelp and hoped that they would be open. To my surprise, they had been open for several hours, since they also serve breakfast.  As soon as I got in, the guy behind the counter was already preparing to-go orders. Lots of them. And yet, no sooner than I sat down after I placed my order, it was ready. I had to chuckle when full-sized plastic squeeze bottles of both the red and green sauces were on my tray -- I was immediately transported to the Mission District back home.  The hot sauce was mild enough for me, and flavorful. I was in a gringa mood and requested the hard shell tacos, rather than their standard soft. I wasn't too enamored with the chicken on my tacos; nothing wrong with them -- in fact, I could see each individual chunk rather than the shredded versions I've always associated with cafeteria school lunches. I've been gradually not liking chicken over the years, and I think this was one of those days. The salsas helped with the flavor and I ended up eating everything on my plate.  The rice was different, to me. Not the standard ""Mexican rice"". This had corn kernels mixed in. And there was no heavy tomato paste component.  Small place. About 4 tables of 4 seats each, and 4 stools near the window.  Definitely a popular place with the local workers in the area. And when I was in, there were quite a few Latino customers, which again is a good indicator of authenticity.  A restaurant I'd come back to, especially for its diverse menu, affordable dishes, and friendy and efficient staff.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

The cheeseteak was pretty good but the loud mouthed racist employee was not. Two customers had a brief exchange in German and one employee took it upon himself to tell them they should only be speaking English here in 'murica.

"I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately I don't think I'm going back. I went to get a mani-pedi, at first the staff was super friendly and they took care of me right away, even though they were kinda busy. However, the lady who did my pedicure just rushed through it. There were two other ladies, who were also getting a pedicure, who were there before me, and still they finished mine before them.   As I was waiting to get up to a table to get my mani done, they asked me to stay where I was at, even though there were several empty tables. This lady just grabbed a magazine, used that as support for the uv lamp and started doing my nails right there. I didn't see them clean the tools or anything, everything felt very un-professional, I even felt some burning from the gel when I first had my hands under the uv light. And just to add to my discomfort, my choice of gel color was mislabeled. They agreed to change the gel color, but this lady just cleaned the 1st coat with her fingers!!! I honestly don't know why I didn't left by this point... After I decided on a different color, they only did 1 coat of gel, and when I asked them to do another one she said ""one's enough"". They didn't even let the gel cure for the entire 60 seconds.   My nails didn't look bad, so I left feeling that I should give them a chance... HOWEVER my gel mani started to peel off that same night. So I went back the next day and asked for a refund, they very politely offered to just re-do my nails for free. And again, same experience: wrong color, rushed, one coat of gel polish, un-clean tools. No cuticle oil, no lotion or hot towel after the mani.

I went in today and there was a new girl (not sure of her name, not one of the regular people I've seen there before).   I asked for my usual cleanup and she not only left my eyebrows incredibly uneven, but also VERY thin and highly shortened. I was not happy at all.

They cook the meat for their cheesesteaks when you order it, they don't leave it piled up on the grill top warming--always fresh. They steam the cheese after putting it on and it incorporates the cheese throughout the sandwich so you get some with every bite. The prices are affordable and the size of the sandwiches are huge.

"I've never sat at a proper table in the bottom restaurant, but I've had quite a few pints in the upstairs bar. Sportsman's was on a list of places I've always liked, but never seemed to think of when looking for a place to go... until recently when I started playing trivia there every week. Now it's on the rotation of regular spots.   The food is REALLY good for a bar, and the menu is large (not really varied though). I have never received a meal I didn't like, and some things are even noteworthy like the handcut fries, juicy burgers and perfectly fried chicken and/or catfish. The bartenders are always great upstairs, however the table service is awful, so just order at the bar. It's great for groups up there versus the restaurant downstairs. Downside is it can get REALLY smoky up there, and there are basically no windows to air it out. Sometimes I miss living in a state where is illegal to smoke in bars, but it is what it is.  TV's aren't the best for gamewatching, but they have the proper sports cable packages if you need to camp out in front of one to watch a particular game.

"Would be a 3.5/5 but I'll round up. I went here on a weekend with friends and the place was packed. I was finally sat after a half an hour wait, at 8:30 PM. Maybe they were short-staffed or exhausted after a long Friday but they were not clearing empty tables nearly as efficiently as they should have and a few parties that had waited with me ended up leaving because it was almost as if they forgot about them...  The environment was okay, but the BBQ on our table was a bootleg BBQ at best. Definitely a cheap afterthought, just plopped on the table. Underneath you could see it just plugs in, with inadequate support for the barbecue (no real grease drip tray for example. With the lack of a tray the grease was dripping on the floor and some even dripped on my pants. I'm hoping this was just MY table, maybe someone knocked the tray off? I mean my feet were hitting it, my knees at least.   Anyways onto the food, the cuts of meat were great but definitely a little expensive. I complained about the price, before seeing the amount of food they brought out! I really was impressed. We ordered a few side dishes that were lackluster but we came for the BBQ and Miga delivered. It was around 100 dollars for 2 of us with the BBQ combo for 2, beer, and side dishes included. I immediately regretted my decision to eat that amount of meat and proceeded to get the meat sweats.

But I've always loved it (my great uncle, as a bellhop there, used to give me rides on the luggage carts, and my mom's cousin got married there some 30 years ago), and it was the first place I thought of when we started planning the wedding. We figured it couldn't hurt to take a tour and have a chat.   First of all, I had loved that old world feeling of the lobby, etc., so I wasn't crazy about the renovations that they did. The new blue/brown/gold decor took a little adjusting to, but it eventually grew on me, and I got over it. And they brought back the player piano, which definitely adds a nice touch while you're lounging.   More importantly, when we sat down with the events manager, we were totally upfront about our budget, and instead of just saying they were out of our range, he went through their entire package and suggested things that could be adjusted to make it work with what we had. The customer service we received from them continued to be fantastic all the way through the actual wedding, down to the wait staff and banquet manager who were incredibly attentive to us and our guests.

"I'd been by this place a number of times over the last year, and finally went in today for lunch, while running errands with my mother. I had been to this location under a different iteration, and was impressed by the use of space and decor. Huge high-backed booths with wood tables and a spacious pation  Mom ordered the half BLT Club & Salad combo, and I went for the Cuban sandwich with sweet potato fries.  Our server was friendly and attentive, refilling my iced tea a few times and checking back often. My Cuban was great. Well-cooked roast pork with ham, cheese and the requisite pickle and yellow mustard on a pressed sturdy roll.  The sweet potato fries were piping hot. Crispy on the outside, and tender inside. Mom's half sandwich was much pigger than expected, with loads of bacon, and 3 slices of toasted white bread, slathered with mayo.  Our server let it be known that we were the sixth table she'd helped since she'd started working there that morning, but had been coming to this restaurant for a year, and loved it.   Nothing fancy, just good food in a good atmosphere with friendly service. I'll be back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"While Liv has a lovely location and the staff was friendly, my Cobb salad was surprisingly bad. The salad arrived with no dressing, though the server said the dressing was already on it. The turkey appeared to be straight out of a Healthy Choice supermarket packet. The lettuce was strictly iceberg and there were just a few crumbles of bacon on the top. My friend's breakfast burrito was better but was the smallest burrito I've ever seen. Hopefully Liv's food will improve with time.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Maybe we were not the target demographic! We arrived to our reservations at 9 stood around for 15 minutes while waiting for table to clear, sat down ordered a couple bottles of wine. Literally had to get up myself to pour the wine for our table of 6. We sat an hour before being able to flag down our waiter to place steak orders. Then sat around for another hour while our steaks sat inside the burner and were terribly over cooked. As I told our waiter Bill that we have been waiting an hour and did he know about our food, he barked back that he had to see how many tickets are ahead of us. Then when our food finally got to the table my side dish was completely forgotten about. (I ordered saut√©ed mushrooms, but that was unavailable, so I ordered spinach au gratin, which arrived 5-7 minutes after my over cooked steak.) I let a side waitress know about my over cooked steak because Bill (our head waiter) was no where to be found. And she returned with a second over cooked steak 5 minutes later. Then I found Bill asked if he thought the steak was medium rare or medium well he suggested I speak with a manger, the manager Aliya (or Alicia) heard my terrible experience and asked what do I suggest for her to do. I told her please make an effort to give me some sort of incentive to return. She disappeared said she will take care of it and returned and asked again what would I like her to do, I replied the service was terrible, the waiters were no where to be found, when we sat down the restaurant was packed, it is now 11:30 two and a half hours after our reservation, (not by choice) and every one is gone accept us, we had a terrible experience, and after everything, you are asking me what do I suggest you to do??

"Huge!!! 300 seats are very very far from the rink, or stage depending on what you are there for.  Tons of concessions and full liquor bars. I recommend getting a drink before you get there because they charge an arm and a leg. The food is what you would expect, reheated pizza, fried chicken, even the outback has precooked items.   If you are coming to see a show, I recommend getting the side seats closer to the stage. I went to see Radiohead and figured it would be viewable from the back 100's. There were no screens showing the show. All I saw was miniature figures playing instruments.   Easy to get in and out. Lines move quickly.

"First and foremost, the food was absolutely amazing! I gave such a low review because the waitress, Lexi, was horribly rude. She asked for our ID's then proceeded to tell my man he looked like he was 12, if the ID was his older brothers, then said she didn't even care if it happened to be fake, THEN threw out ID's on the table. When bringing out the French Onion dip, she handed it off to by my man by said, ""here you go brat."" She then was saying how he was ""picky"" even though he only asked for extra spice on the side when the steak comes out. She also slammed down the check when we were ready. We are both servers and understand the busy life, so we didn't mind if it took awhile. But the waitress was extremely rude and I was appalled she talked to her guest like that.

"Okay, we found this amazing spot on a whim looking for a place to eat with a patio as we had our pup with us. And my goodness was that a tasty lunch. I wish I lived near here!  The spicy wings were just the perfect kick and really just the tru definition of spicy wings. Be sure to ask for extra napkins.   I ordered the chicken salad club sandwich (no bacon) and minestrone soup. The chicken salad sandwich had 3 layers of crunchy flatbread and LOADED with the best chicken salad I've seriously every had with two nice chunks of tomato and lettuce. I would come back for that any day if I was close enough. The minestrone soup was super flavorful, but could have used a pinch more salt, but that's just me...I like it a little saltier haha.  Overall, so glad we decided to pop in. Thanks to Bring Fido!  Oh, The patio has nice big fans so it wasn't too hot to sit out there at 2pm.

We have never been to any restaurant that totally ignored us for 40 minutes! Needless to say, we will never go back there again; we had actually driven over 2 hours with our dog from our winter rental house in Cape Coral just to get there. We heard it was a great ""dog-friendly"" place to eat along the Tampa Riverwalk and were looking forward to our outing. Yes, there were many dogs there, but nobody even tried to bring over a water bowl for our little guy as advertised until after 30 minutes in the hot sun (luckily we always bring water with us for him) and no free dog biscuit was ever offered either.

"There's no better way to celebrate being 40% done with your work week than dollar beers. Period. That's why somebody invented Dirtbags, the dive-bar-masquerading-as-an-upstanding-college-bar. That being said, it's important to realize what you're in for.  Dirtbags does not have a pleasant odor, so it's probably not a great place to take a date if she/he has a sensitive nose. It's also not particularly clean or non-dank, but it certainly isn't going to stain your work clothes...if you wear them to a bar...like I sometimes do. Also, I can't speak to the women's room, but the men's bathroom is...communal, let's say. There's a trough and a toilet with a door that sometimes closes. Stage fright will be your worst enemy.  Lastly, if you happen to get Mark as your bartender, and you'll know quickly if you do, prepare to have your ear talked off about several endearing topics not limited to: misogyny, ultra-intense political beliefs, racism, and how great he is.  Now, with the pleasantries out of the way, on to the great things about Dirtbags! Dollar 10 oz drafts of Bud Light, Coors Light, and Miller Lite make this a must-see Tuesday destination in Tucson at least once. (You'd have to be a degenerate to go every Tuesday. Ahem.) The bartenders (Candace and Jazer especially) are attentive, friendly, and accurate. There are plenty of TVs to watch whatever cable has to offer, and they are more than happy to accommodate most requests. The Juke Box has a decent selection of bar-type music - I wouldn't want/expect anything more from a bar.  Beyond the cheap booze, my favorite thing is the pinball machine. The Austin Powers pinball game is the greatest ever created, and whoever the CFF guy is on the high score list, well, he must be a freak, because those score are amazing.  Dirtbags features a full bar and food that is actually quite good for the price. There is also a covered outdoor seating area for smoking and taking in the picturesque views of Speedway Blvd.  Certain nights when school is in session, this place can get PACKED. Be aware, there can be a line with a decent wait.  Overall, Dirtbags is exactly what it advertises itself to be, ""a part of growing up."" Some of it is great, some not so great.

"This place was actually pretty nice for a a Red Roof. The lady working at the check in office was so awesome and accommodating. She got us checked in early and made suggestions of what to do while we're in the area. She told us that unfortunately she had to put us in a handicapped room because that was all that was available, but it actually worked in our favor since it was bigger with a fridge and microwave. The outside isn't that fancy, but the rooms are clean and pretty updated. One of the complaints I have is the lack of TV channels. Motels brag about having HBO on their signs now, but there's only 40 other channels besides that, and most of them are news and sports. Thank goodness for Netflix and YouTube. Anyway, the biggest downfall to the room was the tub/shower. The drain was clogged in the tub and it filled up with two inches of water in a matter of five minutes. The shower head was old and broken, so it was spraying onto the ceiling and causing a huge mess. I hated that I had to be careful showering. Besides those downfalls, this is probably one of the nicer budget motels in the area.

So I've been living in this area for 4 years now and I've never noticed this place. I would normally go to this place called Wonder Wu but I never feel like driving there anymore. The food here is really good! I have been here three times now since December. I love the chicken with broccoli. My mom got the sweet and sour chicken before. She really liked it. The lady who answers the phones and works the register is really nice. She always makes a point to acknowledge people when they come in. This place is a bit small but there are a few tables where people can sit down and eat. I always call my food in and pick it up. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because I wish they had more vegetarian entrees. I also called and ordered spring rolls but they were eggs rolls. I'm assuming the lady didn't understand me or maybe they are considered the same thing. At other Chinese restaurants I've been to they are different. The eggs rolls were good just extremely crunchy maybe they were just over cooked. Above all the food is good and the prices are affordable. It is located in a plaza that isn't usually busy. There is plenty of parking!   Sorry I forgot to take pictures...oops,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"My wife and I had been wanting to try this place for a while now since we live in the neighborhood, and we finally made a date night to hit it up.  Let me tell you what...this place is AMAZING.  Parking/Location: There basically is none.  If you live in this area of Carrollton, you know what I am talking about.  Best bet would be to take the street car if possible, and if not, just understand that you are going to have to be patient unless you luck out and find something right away.  The place is a tiny old house set back on Carrollton between Juicy Luicy and the bank on the corner.  Ambiance: The place is small, but decorated beautifully.  Perfect for a date, or a dinner with friends.  There are a couple of tables out front on the sidewalk, so if it's nice out and you aren't trying to do the romance thing (traffic, sidewalk traffic), it could be fun to sit outside.  Again, this place is SMALL.  I would say if you are going on a Friday or Saturday night...call ahead or hit up OpenTable for reservations.  We made reservations on Sat night for 6:30pm and were seated immediately.  Service: Our server was very nice, prompt and chatted with us, I would say, just the right amount.  She was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed, and was very good about recommending dishes and explaining the nuances of the menu items.  Food: Good wine selection and the drink menu looked fantastic.  We opted for a couple of glasses of red (Pinot and Cab, can't honestly remember the names).  We started out with the oyster appetizer and it was great.  Cornmeal fried oysters with a chili aioli and apples.  The oysters were perfectly cooked and all the flavors complimented each other wonderfully.  My wife had the diver scallop entree and she loved it.  We are both huge fans of scallops and must say these are some of the best I have ever had.  They were cooked perfectly (pan seared) and melt in your mouth.  The mashed potatoes were tasty as well and the presentation was nice.  I had the double cut pork chop and HOLY WOW.  This was one of the best dishes I have ever had in my life.  The pork chop (cooked medium and pefectly) was thick, juicy and the flavor was throughout the meat.  I'm not sure what that marinade was, but it was outstanding.  Wonderful char on the outside with a roasted red pepper jus that will knock your socks off.  The crispy onion strings were a good compliment to the pork chop and the Jack Daniels and roasted corn coush coush was killer as well.  For desert we had the pecan pie tart with homemade bourbon ice cream.  The pecan pie was good, but the ice cream was the star here.  Very strong bourbon flavor which we both loved.  Perfect compliment to the sweetness of the pie/chocolate.  Price: Prices are more than fair for the quality of food, the ambiance, and the service.  It's no more expensive than any other restaurant of this caliber.  For a couple, expect to pay about $100 (before tip) if you have wine, one appetizer, two entrees, a dessert + coffee.  Conclusion: GO.  You will not be disappointed.  I really have NO idea how some of these folks gave this place 3 stars.  It must have been an off night is all I can say.  My wife and I will DEFINITELY be back.  If you go, and you are a meat eater...GET THE PORK CHOP!",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 5.0

"Service and food were both cold. The brisket tasted like it was made from a commercial electrical smoker and made without love. The meat was cut too thick, wasn't tender, needed seasoning, and barely had smoke flavor.  The sauces were amateur, slaw was one sided, mashed potatoes were dry, and biscuits were cold. When we ordered 3oz. draft pours the server didn't know which beer was which. We were rushed and had to go to another table to get ketchup we ask for but was never delivered. We asked for the kids sliders with just meat and cheese and just got meat no cheese. The check was dropped without asking if we wanted anything else (which we wouldn't ordered anything else anyway). It was just not good. I'm really shocked I was recommended to go there from a local. Never again.",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 1.0

"One of the best traditions in Indianapolis! Every year, I look forward to attending the strawberry festival. The church opens its doors and thousands flock to Monument Circle. It's really quite incredible how many people come to this festival, but the shortcake really is that good. It's $7 for strawberries, vanilla ice cream, shortcake and whipped cream. The ingredients are quality and you get a generous helping. Be aware: this isn't so much a festival as a large gathering of people who love strawberry shortcake. There is music throughout the day, but not a whole lot else. (Not a complaint by any means. I love the simplicity of the event) A few vendors have popped up to sell popcorn, hot dogs, etc. in recent years.

"My opinion is its very underwhelming.  I went with the spaghetti and chicken which is a dish that they are famous for.  The spaghetti had a sweet sauce, cut up wieners and some cheese on top.  Reminds me when I was a kid and Mom would make weiner and beans, but in this case with spaghetti and sweet sauce.  Lol The chicken comes orginal or spicy.  The orginal is flavorless.  The spicy is just flavorless chicken with a ton of cayenne pepper on the deep fried chicken skin.  If you are sensitive to having burning lips and mouth I would suggest to refrain from the spicy.  We couldn't figure out why they gave me a couple containers of gravy with my meal.  I found out from a seasoned Jollibee regular  you dip your chicken in the gravy.  Which makes sense since the orginal chicken has zero flavor.  Two thumbs up for they serve Pepsi products over Coke.  Other than that this is a place I will probably never eat at again, unless someone is buying and if that's the case its fries and gravy with a Pepsi.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

The inside is totally different - darker, and definitely the ambiance of a bar. The menu is extensive, with a variety of burgers, wraps, salads, and mains. I had the chicken shawarma, which was indicated as a house specialty. The chicken were perfectly seasoned, large pieces, in a crispy wrap with greens, tomatoes, pickles, and garlic mayo. It was delicious, but the way it was cooked caused the greens to be very wilted. I also prefer my pickles cold, not hot. It was obviously cooked in a press of some kind The fries were crispy and excellent. Service was fast and friendly.

"Words cannot describe how amazing the brunch at Lacroix was.  However, as this is a restaurant review, I'll try my best. The food was incredible. I went into the meal promising myself that if I was not wowed by a dish, I would not finish it. I ate everything - the only items I did not finish were at the end of the meal, when I physically was unable to consume another bite. The hors d'oeuvres were particularly impressive - every item, from the octopus in saffron hummus to the foie gras with shredded phyllo to the potato cakes topped with salmon rillettes and caviar, was delicious to the point that my whole party went back for seconds.  I love the setup of the brunch as well - the main courses are all served in the kitchen, so all dishes are fairly freshly made and patrons have a chance to see the action. After we gorged ourselves on hors d'oeuvres, we found ourselves faced with too many incredible options: the duck confit was decadent, the mushrooms were incredible. The duck and capone at the carving station were both perfectly cooked and served with delicious sauces, completely sidestepping the problem most other buffets face with dehydrated, overcooked meat.  The dessert station was not as plentiful as in past years; it seems that Lacroix has shifted its focus to the hors d'oeuvres (a decision we wholeheartedly support). The creme brulee was lovely and the bread pudding was just divine. We were too stuffed to fully enjoy the desserts, but the few bites we managed to take were all delicious.   Service was friendly, if a bit inattentive. We were in a semi-private room and sometimes felt a little forgotten - it took a while for us to flag down a waiter for coffee service. To be fair, servers were doing a fantastic job keeping all the stations replenished.   Lacroix was the perfect place to spend Mother's Day - it was the most perfect a brunch could be, and honestly, one of the best meals I have ever had.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Went here and ordered the fried chicken, Mac and cheese , greens and mashed potatoes. The chicken was good. The Mac and cheese was as if it had been cooked too long because it was as mushy. The greens tasted like they were straight out a can of Glory Greens not the real deal. The food that was sitting out in the pans for a customer to choose from did not look appetizing for example the New York steak looked nasty and teriyaki steak looked like vomit in my opinion. Oh and the cornbread was dry. I made it through because I paid my money and was starving but would never go back. And got the nerve to be open only on weekends.

"Came here for an early dinner before a Dan + Shay concert at the Bridgestone Arena (just across the street).  My friend and I had a few bar bites just an hour or two earlier so we decided to share an appetizer and an entree.  Before our food came out though, a staff member came by with a basket of different types of bread for you to choose from and some sort of eggplant spread that was pretty good.  For the bread, I chose the garlic bread which did have a little kick to it.  For our food we ordered the grilled octopus as our appetizer and it was very well cooked and larger than I expected which is a plus.  I really enjoyed this dish.  We also got the funghi pizza which was okay.  I wish the crust were even crispier but that's a personal preference.  The portion was pretty big and we barely made it through the pizza.  We were sad we couldn't get the rest to go since we can't bring outside food to the Arena.

I'm surprised to see that besides the ubiquitous bun vermicelli, they also offer banh hoi, which I like better.  I can't remember seeing this angel hair noodle offered in other Vietnamese restaurants!! I ordered it with grilled pork, and enjoyed each mouthful of it.     Why just four stars?

"SENIORS BEWARE! This company is completely without medical morals or ethics. ""First do no harm,"" means nothing to them. Only the bottom line and scamming elderly people out of their money, whether it's in their best interests or not.   My aunt was 87 years old and in early stages of dementia. She had a host of  health issues that made her visably unwell. Anyone looking at her, especially someone in the medical profession, would know she was not well.  Well, she wanted new teeth, wanted information on implant dentures and Aspen was more than happy to comply.As her medical surragate, she knew I did not think it was in her best interests,  In fact I thought it was dangerous.  She chose a well meaning friend to go with her.  Aspen didn't consider her health or her age to see if it was a good idea, ask about any other health issues... nothing. She paid her 7,000 deposit and that was it. They did the procedure (including bone grafts to hold the implant.  She did not have enough bone in her tiny jaw to hold anything).  From that point on she was in constant pain. She had multiple visits complaiing, stating she wasn't happy, begging for relief. The only calls she received from there were for her remaining balance of $7,000 ($14,000). No medical support and no human empathy. There was someone who was compassionate and kind, but he is no longer there to talk to.  They badgered her into paying her 7,000 + balance before they would fix anything.  She had been in constant pain since it all started in April/May, and we were approaching November. Employees had commented on her weight loss.   Well her weight dropped and dropped as she couldn't eat even the softest food without horrible pain. She started trying to see about getting her money back,as Aspen advertises ""100% satisfaction guarantee"" and she was not happy. Her health declined, she went into hospice and her weight was 79 when she died.. If she'd been able to eat properly we would have had six months or more with her. We would have had her for the holidays. We have contacted the company and the owner/dentist, who states that ""They can find no reason to think anything was unsatisfactory about the service she received."" The staff is perkey, and the dentists charismatic, but the owner seems with no compassion.  He, oddly enough, was the last person who examined her.  As she left that day, he said, we will make this right for you ... I promise. So just be clear if you choose this company they do not care about your medical history or if you are in proper health and SHOULD  or should not receive implants... just that you can pay for them. After you've paid they don't care if you can eat or the level of pain you are in.... as long as they have their money. And if you die, they certainly don't care that their poor product and lack of care may have contributed. They want you to finance this procedure.  They get their money up front that way.  They do not want you to make payments to them. If you become unhappy, you will not finish paying.  She made me promise to try to get her money back.   She  would have been satisfied with half.  She told me that she felt that was fair, because, "" they had done some work"".  So instead of trying to honor her wish....they refuse.  Let me repeat, SHE WAS NOT SATISFIED! Now, in memory of her, I will make sure that everyone I know ( and I have lived in this area over 50 years) will know of her experiene and to take great care before they walk into this office.  Are all Aspen offices this uncaring and money hungry?  I don't know, but this one is.  I am writing this review because there has not been a hint of compassion or responsibility shown by this company.  If you or a loved one are considering using them I would look elsewhere because even if you want to give them the benefit of the doubt about their care for her health they certainly didn't care that she was not 100% satisfied. Sher verbalized it repeatedly to them while she was alive. And they didn't care. And they certainly don't care now that she's gone. I feel that they are taking advantage of some of the elderly residents of the community because quite often they don't have a voice in stating what has happened. Please be warned and go elsewhere.   I would be happy to remove or adjust it if they showed an iota of compassion or anything to stand behind their 100% satisfaction guarantee. I can guarantee that neither my aunt, nor any of the rest of the family, were happy with her experience considering the fact it lead to hastening her death and making her last months with us full of pain.",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 1.0
"Worst New Years Eve Ever  This was one of my favorite places, however after a horrible experience that is no longer the case.  My family and I (3 adults, 1 child) went to mt fuji for new years eve dinner. We do not eat out very often and look forward to fun night out. This evening we all started with appetizers which were delicious. I had my usual steak and lobster entree. The steak was cooked perfect and I ate a few bites. The lobster however was bad and I could tell by the smell of it (after tasting and swallowing the first bite) that something was wrong. It smelled like ammonia or rotten fish. I immediately called the waitress over and after she smelled it she agreed it was rotten and took the dish away. In a panic of food poisoning I went to the bathroom and threw up. Of course my party lost their appetite because of the situation and we're done eating after only a few bites of food. I can overlook one bad lobster tail in the case but the response from management was horrible. First, others in my party did not want the food that they ordered after my bad dish and the waitstaff took their plates away. The server apologized perfusly then brought our check, which included us being charged for all of our food (even the bad lobster). I asked to see a manager and she immediately came over and told me to go see a doctor because she did not think the food was bad. I explained that I only ate a bite and vomited up the bad food. She agreed to take of the lobster dish but we had to pay for everything  else (even what we didn't eat) she also kept saying the chef said the lobster was fine and that I was making the whole thing up. That is not the response we should have received and after paying 80 dollars for food we did not eat, throwing up, and being called a lier, we left hungry and our big night out was ruined.   Mt.

The tools they used were not sanitary and one even had some kind of rust or discoloration on it - not very assuring.  The woman doing my nails nicked my finger when cutting my cuticles and didn't say anything - didn't even acknowledge the fact that I was bleeding! She also had absurdly long nails and kept digging them into my skin, which made for a very unpleasant hand massage (which lasted 30 seconds at most).

I did the same today, but the waitress informed me my dish (massaman curry) was already pretty mild. I told her I understood that, but I didn't want it spicy at all.  When it arrived, the level of heat was indistinguishable from my friend's ""medium"" curry and after a few bites my lips and tongue were stinging. It was close to the spiciest Thai I've ever tasted, as someone who usually settles on a 2 between a scale of 1 to 5. The taste was fine, but the heat was almost unbearable and it seemed like my order was completely disregarded. If I go back, I'll be ordering something like pad Thai, but I wasn't happy with my experience at all and will probably avoid it in the future.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"After noticing this place advertising on restaurant.com and randomly buying a discount certificate, we finally decided to give it a try last fall.  Overall, it was a fun experience with nice staff and good enough food, but  afterward (and still) we're not terribly compelled to make a repeat visit.    The issue I sometimes have with family style Italian restaurants like this is that they try to cram every last thing grandma ever cooked in the ""old country"" into the menu, which makes it all sort of blend together and removes any possibility for uniqueness.  I felt that Da Vinci struggled a bit with finding a balance between offering focused variety and every permutation of sauces, meats, and pasta types imaginable.    I don't want to knock the place too much, because, there was nothing offensive about the food.  It was just...ordinary, like something a decent home cook could put together with the right ingredients.  If I lived right there I'm sure I would go there every now and again.  But nothing to single out in the Philadelphia dining scene.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Very sub par bowling establishment. We use to bowl here for league and it was always clean, full, and a good time. We went out for a night of bowling this weekend and thought to come here. Was shocked it wasn't Camino Seco Bowl anymore. Gave it a shot anyways.   4 bowlers with shoes cost $49....Ouch!!!  Got to our lane and the tables on the floor had food and stickiness all over them. I looked up and down the floor and noticed everyone was eating and drinking down on the bowling floor area. There were signs everywhere saying ""watch out, slippery shoes cause injuries"" My first thought was, yeah that's why regular bowling allies make the customers keep the food and drinks up top.   Bathrooms were gross.   Got thirsty, ordered one 20 oz domestic draft of beer.....$5.61  Balls and shoes are old, warn out, and severely used.   Only gave it a second star because they had decent black light and galaxy bowl effects. And when the lights went out you could forget you were sitting in filth :-(   Will not be returning to this place",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 2.0
"The vegan scene is really taking off in Philadelphia. I was in town for a conference and was really excited to know that there were going to be cheap easy to find vegan eats around here. I had the Reuben sandwich and it was so good. It wasn't your typical vegan fast food that is usually focused on ""healthy/clean eating"" it was just as greasy and yummy as anything else in the market.

"After days of visiting Disney World theme parks, water parks, and Universal Studios in Orlando, it is quite a change visiting the Gulf of Mexico at Clearwater, Florida. Toucan's Bar & Grill provided even a better ending to a nice day at the beach: Good food, good price, good service & good ambience all combined into an EXCELLENT dining experience. Quality of food is comparable to McCormick & Schmick's & Yard House at the Fountains at Roseville, California. We had live whole lobsters ($16.99), scallops & shrimp ($19), grouper nuggets (kid's, $7). All tasted great and cooked just right. For desert, tuxedo bombe ($5.95) and cheese cake ($5.95) were also yummy. Service by hostess at the door and server Kimberly were marvelous, attentive yet not intruding.  It's a little walk (about one & half block) from the main beach, marina and traffic round circle so few customers who were on the beach ventured thus far to find it.

We never had Moe's up north where I use to live, but everyone said how this place was so good so maybe I was expecting more. I'm not sure if it's all their locations or if it's just this location since some of the reviews said this location isn't that great either. I usually get the burrito bowl and I just think it lacked a lot of flavor compared to Chipotle. Sure their salsa bar sets them a part from their competitors, but the salsas didn't stand out enough for me to think it's any better than Chipotle or Tijuana Flats. I think the one thing good they have going for them is their burrito special on Monday - you get a burrito (or bowl), drink and chips for $5.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I tried out beyond nails yesterday!  I Came in for a pedicure and a fill. I was brought back for a pedicure with no wait. I had one of the best pedicures with Kim!! She really took her time with me!   Then I was told to wait for someone to be able to do my nails. As i'm waiting 5 people come in and get helped. 30 minutes go by and I'm still waiting to get my nails done. I finally get seated in Vicky's chair ( The salon owner) she halfway greeted me. Then asked if it was OK if she continue to vacuum for a little bit. Lol As I was already waiting 30 minutes. After sitting in the chair Vicky finally starts to do my nails 15 minutes after. Now I've been waiting 45 minutes. She was constantly distracted with everything going on, the phone , people coming in. She got up from the chair to start someones pedicure water twice. The phone rang about 10 times which she proceeded to answer every time. After every call she would talk shit about the person trying to make an appointment. I understand running a business and having to answer the calls all the time but it was how she handled it. Then the color finally goes on my nails and it's not drying properly. She blames me for not having my hand fully under the heat. Then realize this color needs to be under the heat for longer than one minute. Doesn't apologize. Then leaves the chair again to go to somebody's eyebrows. Which this person did not have an appointment and I was already in her chair. She comes back and her coworker was trying to help finish my nails. I hear her mention to her coworker that I'm very picky make sure you're careful where you place that diamond. I should be picky I'm paying for this!!!!!! It was not a relaxing experience. I was there for 3 hours and it should've taken an hour and a half.   She was very unprofessional and rude. Knowing how she complained about the customers calling in just makes me wonder what she said about me!   Long story short I went in and had one of the best experiences with my pedicure then completely took a 180.  I would   NOT recommend Vicky at beyond nails if you're looking for a relaxing experience.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 1.0

"Me gusta!!  This place lacks any sort of ambiance whatsoever. There are about 6 or 7 tables and what looks like a cell phone store attached. But when you take a bite of your food none of that will matter. You'll be transported to another place. This was some of the best Mexican food I've ever had, hands down.   Odd that there are no prices on the menu (there is both an English and Spanish version btw), but a friend and I split an enchiladas (4) platter and tacos al pastor (2) for about $8 each. Excellent price for the amount and quality of food.  To add to the charm, on one of the tables is a large tv that is tuned to one of the wackiest and most entertaining news shows ever created.

"Small, but beautifully decorated with a whimsical atmosphere.  They have a small patio with outdoor seating and a really cute party room in the back that probably seats a dozen or so people.  The carrot cake was delicious as well as the charcuterie board.  They have a great variety of drinks (alcoholic, coffee and tea).  The white wedding tea was very good.  I would have given a much higher ranking, however, I was very unimpressed with the staff and how things were run...   It was busy when I arrived with my parents a little before 4.  We were asked by the hostesses (2 of them working together) if we wanted to be seated inside, outside or first available.  We said first available, gave them our information and we were informed they had a table outside for us that they were cleaning at that moment and we would be seated within the next minute or 2.  As we sat across from the hostess stand (4-5 feet away in plain sight) for 20 or more minutes, we observed and talked about what appeared to be a very chaotic and inefficiently run operation.  We continued to notice the large number of people waiting were not being seated even though there were 3 tables outside ready and clean since we arrived.  The 2 women who came in behind us finally asked what was going on and were seated.  I approached the hostess stand and also asked about the situation.  I received the reply of, ""Well, we were waiting to seat you inside and there has not been a table available..."".    Once we were seated and tried to order, we were informed the items that we wanted were not served after 4pm (it was 4:15pm).  This was a bit frustrating as we sat inside unnecessarily for so long.  Once we were seated and ordered, we had a good experience and enjoyed our food, tea and time there.  The waitress we had was attentive and nice.  Still debating if the food and cake is worth the experience they provided...",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Ming's kitchen is a pretty decent local American Chinese take out place.   The chicken with eggplant and garlic sauce has good flavor, but is very sweet.  A bunch of their sauces are sweeter than I would like, and I know that is a common issue at American Chinese places, but this place can be sweeter than most.   Sometimes they have Chinese broccoli, which is awesome. I like it worth the pork and garlic sauce.   Singapore noodles are pretty good. I could use a bit more spice and a little less salt in there. The wonton soup was okay, but my partner does not like their egg drop soup.  I think she misses the egg drop soup of Chinese places past. Steamed pork dumplings are tasty, but pretty standard, they don't really look made in house. The egg roll is not the best I've had, wrong texture on the wrapper.

"Moved from the Philly area to the collegeville area and one of my main fears in life at the time was finding a place that would have a staff that would be able to cut my hair. Without a proper haircut I could not go on with my daily activities, and hence go on with life.   After countless hours of using current technology by scouring what is now known as the World Wide Web, I was able to find a quaint hideaway known as ""Parker's"", which as stated by them is my barbers barber, even that at the time of search I did not have one.   I took the chance one early Saturday morning.  It seemed everyone else who was in need of a grooming was too at this quaint hideaway.   The place was packed.  I quietly inched my way in and placed my name onto the clipboard in a fancy script. An hour and a half later I was called by Mitch, who from what I hear is a true ladies man.   Joe, and I believe Brian(?) have also cut my hair who have done stellar jobs and deserve commendations on their efforts of male grooming.   Long review short, I'm on my 4th cut here. I love the staff and how they cut my hair.  Make sure you come early!  The place is usually packed.

"Wonderful stay here for Arch Madness.  The hotel is located near several great restaurants.  The rooms are nice.  We had a double double.  There is no dresser though, only a closet.  Valet parking worked great.  We really didn't have to wait long for the car.  Most impressive though, was the fitness center.  I usually stay in Hilton brands and I have never seen a more well appointed fitness center in a hotel.  There was a free weight/weight machine area with yoga mats, kettlebells, exercise balls and a bosu.  There was a Peleton bike along with traditional bikes, stair steppers, treadmills, and ellipticals.  There were scented cold towels on hand for your post workout cool down.    All of the staff was attentive and polite even with a large crowd of people.  (It must have been a Valpo team hotel based on the number of fans etc).

There have been several other times when I've called 30 minutes before closing and they wouldn't take my order.  It takes 10-15 minutes to make a pizza!  I contacted the owner and told him that they should put something on their website to the effect that ""our closing time is 10:00 pm but we stop taking orders at XXX"" but apparently they have enough business that they don't need to be considerate of their customers.  If they posted a notice on their website & Facebook,  I would have no problems with them not taking my order before closing.  No other carry out restaurant that we go to has done this and most restaurant employees understand that they may have to work 15 minutes or so past closing time! That's the nature of the business!

"We were too hungry to wait for a spot in Acme Oyster House so this was the other closet place on my hit list while visiting!   We weren't looking for ambience or a fancy dinner, just in the mood for some oily fried food and seafood, so this place fit the bill perfectly!   We started with BBQ shrimp which is basically shrimp in a bath of butter, oil, garlic, and spices! I loved it! Definitely avoid this dish if you are afraid of turning off your date with messy eating.   We also ordered the soft shell crab dinner. Wow, I wish we had access to these in San Diego! I've only had dinky ones before these, which were the size of my hands!  The prices for the quality of this seafood were great, although, I'm pretty sure you make up for that cost in another way!   That being said, I'm glad Deanie's is far enough away to keep me from a new possible soft shell crab addiction and a possible heart attack!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Amazing.  My friend that was visiting from out of town met me at another restaurant in the Grove that I go about once every three months. After having to wait to even order a drink for over 20 minutes while sitting at the bar, we decided to head to the CWE. On the way, we saw this amazing gem in the Cortex. We decided to turn right around and check it out.  This was the best decision I have made in a long time! The food and service was spectacular!  We started with the Turkey Wheat bread, Farm Egg, and New Potatoes.  The farm egg was so unexpected and delicious. We then moved on to the turnip tacos.  I am a pescatarian and my friend is a meat eater, so they let us do half mushroom and half pork.  I never would have expected to love turnip shell tacos.   The meal was inspiring, filling, and refreshing. Our server was great with suggestions and never rushed us while we caught up.  If you are anywhere near the Cortex, I highly recommend Vicia. The ambiance and atmosphere are both modern and comfortable.

"I generally opt for Honey's or Sabrina's for brunch, but not when I am positively famished and in the throes of planning the rest of my Sunday around NOT having to wait two hours for a table.   It only took about 30 minutes to score one of the four coveted outdoor spots (a welcome anomaly on a sunny weekend morning) and we were immediately given menus, beer openers (don't judge) and water for our dog.   The waitress was helpful and patient, helping my notoriously indecisive friend choose what she referred to as ""the best meal ever,"" a Southern chicken and waffles dish, which everyone at the table wanted to devour. I went for the breakfast burrito (with vegetarian sausage, which was amazing), my other friends an egg white omelette (sounded boring, but was pretty delicious) and an extremely oversized club sandwich that boasted a side of Boardwalk Fries level potato goodness.  Between the Man vs. Food portions and the unbelievably cheap prices, we left happy and probably a bit more sated than is healthy and/or socially acceptable.   I'll certainly return here, even if Honey's and Sabrina's are ever uncharacteristically under-attended.

He listens carefully to my questions and concerns, and doesn't hesitate to refer to a specialist if he thinks there's something that merits further attention. This is a welcome change over other primary care offices I've been to in the past, where providers have been very hesitant to refer to specialists.

"I am so sorry we didn't check these reviews before advising our son to buy custom couch and ottoman here!  When I lived in Indiana 15 years ago, Godby's had a good rep - this obviously no longer true. 3 months ago our son and daughter in law needed new living room furniture before their new baby was due to arrive in late July. My husband and I wanted to help purchase. They shopped around and found what they wanted at Godby's but needed to order it to get the fabric they wanted.  When they'd made the deal at the store, we sent the $$ to their bank account and they purchased using their debit card - so in effect they paid cash...three months ago. They were told the custom order would arrive in 6-8 weeks. To date, the baby has arrived but not the furniture!   At 8 weeks, the store manager told my son that the ottoman arrived but not the sofa - the sofa ""missed the truck."" They delivered the ottoman and a ""loaner couch"" which is about the size of a love seat.  The last promised delivery date for the sofa was last week - no show, no call with explanation. Now at 12 weeks since paying for ALL the furniture in advance, my son called the store manager today, and was told that he didn't know what the problem is, but would look into it. That was this morning. Still no call back.  I cannot say how disappointed we are with this store and their complete lack of customer service! UPDATE - So my son called back late this afternoon and asked for the store manager, since he hadn't heard back from him.  Manger went home without ever calling my son back with any follow up to their conversation this morning (described above)! I'm astounded that a so called ""family-owned, local business"" operates this way. Appalling lack of customer service.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 1.0
"The four-year-old Lacroix at the Rittenhouse restaurant, named for executive chef Jean Marie Lacroix, is nestled on the Rittenhouse Hotel's second floor. Lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch are offered with a distinctly French flavor.  A co-conspirator and I met on a Wednesday night in December. I picked her up around 7 and we killed time as our reservation wasn't until 8. (Reservations essential.) After checking our coats, we were seated quickly. A trickling fountain with stones could be seen as we walked to our seats. From our table, we had a pleasant view of the square's treetops, decorated with holiday lights.  The dining room and washrooms were clean, comfortable, and well-decorated. Green and yellow hues colored Lacroix. An array of silverware was laid on the tablecloth. Mercifully the place wasn't pitch-dark - lantern lights helped illuminate the mirrors on the walls.  The dress code is ""business casual"" though dinner felt more like a coat-and-tie affair.  It was none too noisy considering it was midweek. The other diners weren't rowdy: there was a small party near us having a grand old time and a few couples scattered about. Light, soft music played some of the time, creating lulls during dinner.  Reviewing the tasting menu, I asked if the meal could be arranged for us. For each course, we would both receive different dishes.  Tasting menus put emphasis on the food itself, not stuffing your gullet. Portions are typically small: in Lacroix's case, the first plates were the smallest, with later plates increasing in size. Each course is set by the chef and presented in a particular order. Since food choices are usually chosen with a theme in mind (showcasing the chef's talent), this gave us the opportunity to sample the chef's palate and psyche.  We received a l'amuse bouche before our dishes: - Mixed organic greens encrusted with peppercorns - Dish with mushrooms, small sweet apples and pears - House cold cured Casco Bay salt cod with ham, Italian parsley salpicon, sweet garlic, Osetra caviar - Crisped Atlantic skate wing with braised chanterelles, confit of shallot, creamed with almonds - Walleye pike gnocchi with crayfish bisque, Moroccan limes, and artichoke - A game bird - pigeon - served medium-rare on top of French toast - Aiguillette of Four Story Hill Farm avian poularde, sliced thinly, in a thick sauce - Roasted Canadian bison rib eye with a red cabbage marmalade, julienned honey crisp apples, and a sauce diablo - Roasted Niman Ranch lamb saddle noisette - braised chop with a sweet potato, coconut medic  We closed the meal with a chocolate mousse (with cocoa powder) and a sorbet (which was a riot of tart flavors). Since we were celebrating a birthday, Lacroix provided a tiffany box cake with a birthday greeting and my partner-in-crime's name on the plate.  Service was on-par with other French establishments - our table was cleared quickly, refreshments arrived when needed, and waiters weren't difficult to attract. Our server was helpful and knowledgeable. Before each course, he described our dishes. I was a little disappointed that he missed some - as much as my friend and I know about food, there were items that we couldn't identify!  Dinner was a serious exercise in gustation. Each dish was an unusual team of flavors - some were on the salty side. Comparatively speaking, Lacroix was a decent deal: per person, a five-plate menu and dessert is $75.  For a meal of this caliber, our meal took more than two-and-a-half hours. The hours we experienced pushed the envelope for a five-course meal. When we were ready to go, they offered to call my car over as I had taken advantage of the valet parking (not free).  Lacroix is effortlessly classy. Fine cuisine is an art; Lacroix, with his attention to detail, tries hard to satisfy. However, Lacroix is not for everyone. It is not appropriate for impatient folks or small children unless you are a sadist. Appropriate for a romantic repast or other special celebration, if you like French cuisine or are just an epicurean, consider Lacroix.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Note to myself. When you walk into a restaurant and the server says ""Oh my"" and seems surprised that people are showing up to eat there, walk the other way! Thought we were probably the only ones in there because we were getting dinner early to make it to the Butler game. Apparently it was just that we were the only people that didn't know this place is horrible.   I can't think of anything redeemable from this meal. Two of our group ordered fish and both were way over cooked and tasteless. The trout was stuffed with goat cheese, really fish and cheese? Who does that? I wish I would have realized that before my son ordered it. The lamb burger, steaks and chicken dishes were just as poor.   The service was curt and barely passable. They dumped off some small broken bread sticks in 1/2 pint bottles that had 1/2 of the sticks sitting down in the bottom of the jars. Nothing to go with them, no butter or bar cheese. The bathrooms were so overwhelmed with bleach that one could barely stay long enough to get the business done. The smell spilled over in to the restaurant enough that one of the group commented it was like eating in a swimming pool. And the bathrooms were downstairs! Guess they were clean though.    The beer and wine menu was quite good but you can find similar in most places in BR.   We tried this place because Brugge was closed secondary to broken pipes from the recent cold weather.

I had a vague idea that I wanted something a little non-traditional but besides that I had no clue what I was after.  Anthony was quick to make a great recommendation for a navy blue tux with a great cut for a slimmer guy, shawl collar, and black silk and satten accents.  He was also patient. I thought I wanted a vest and when it came in I didn't like it and went with a cumberbun. I thought I wanted a certain shirt and he got it for me, but it turns out it didn't work and he had a plan B ordered for me just in case that happened.  Everything was far more affordable than I anticipated, also.   Anyway, I looked great last night.

"Let me first start off by saying LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION.  This restaurant is situated walking distance from where I live and they have a great outdoor bar and patio eating area with a view of the Tampa Bay.  For that alone, I would give it 5 stars.  But, we must review even further.  Bahama Breeze is a chain restaurant, which I am normally not a fan of.  I tend to lean towards privately owned ""non-chain"" restaurants.  Not to say, that I avoid chain restaurants at all costs, nor am I saying that the food and quality are not good.  On the contrary, the food at Bahama Breeze - Tampa has proved to be of better quality than most chain restaurants.  The food is NOT the healthiest, but when I am looking for the occasional comfort food their Lobster & Shrimp Linguine entree and Rum Cake will not disappoint.  Both portions are pretty big, so you might want to share this unless you have a hefty appetite.    The service is inconsistent and average.  The hosts have seated us fairly promptly, but I usually go during the work week when the parking lot doesn't look so crowded.  The servers have been both prompt and helpful or slow and clueless... you never know what you will get.  But I must say that the service has always been friendly and that makes up for the inconsistent service.  THE BAD:  I was not impressed by their mixed drinks.  I felt they were too sweet and probably not enough quality liquor, which I find to be typical of many chain restaurants.  Locals beware because this restaurant is a tourist hot spot, but you probably already know that since there are several hotels in the area and it is located near the airport and a quick drive to Clearwater Beach.  On the other hand, as a Tampa transplant from NY, there's something to be said about still feeling like a tourist in your own home & it's great!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"This one of our favorite places to eat in Brandon! To say the food is delicious is an understatement. Their schnitzel and brats are great. I also enjoyed the pork stuffed with cabbage. The owners are the cool and one of the servers; a true family restaurant.   Their kids menu is also very good. Both of our kids (7 and 4) like coming here as much as we do. It is a small place and can get busy during peak times. So if you do have kids, coming early is a good idea. Whether you live here or are visiting, and enjoy true German food, this should definitely be on your list.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

She responded with ""Sir, you don't have to yell!"".    Honestly - I did not yell at her.  My tone of voice was normal and I am soft-spoken.  I guess that this was some sort of defensive tactic on her part, if I complained about the long wait to management.

"It has been way too many years since I've visited Gaslight! My husband has never been (and we've been together 14 years), so when we had the opportunity for a date night surprise us a few weeks ago I thought I'd take a shot at seeing if there were any seats left for the holiday show.  We got lucky! Called that day for the (early) show that night--two seats in a pretty good location (though I can't imagine many bad seats in that theater).   While the first act was a little slow, I just loved the kitsch of the whole thing. The actors were funny, the stage had clever little bits of interest (the house on the left, the stars in the ceiling). I loved that the actors were ""in on it"" and would regularly interact with the audience's boos and cheers--even mentioning by name some folks who I would assume are the regulars.   The best part was after the traditional musical show, they did a sing-a-long songs show at the very end. The performance of ""Santa Baby"" had me laughing till I was in tears, and the ""It's Christmas Don't Be A Jerk"" by Spongebob Squarepants was hilarious.   The actors were a blast, the music was great--I can't imagine a more fun date night! We even ordered dinner to the table from over at Grandma Tony's. Can't wait to come back again.",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 5.0
"Overall, kind of disappointing. The burger itself had good flavor, but the bun was way too big and the bacon very undercooked. The ambiance wasn't quite what we were looking for either, especially the constant blaring country music and the huge windows next to us that looked into the Circle Center lobby (which features harsh fluorescent lighting, cheap waiting room furniture, fake plants, and bare walls--not the most appealing view). The decor of the restaurant itself is nice--I just wish there weren't all those windows looking into the mall lobby because it REALLY detracts. Best part of dinner was the bourbon caramel milkshake. I wouldn't be in a hurry to go back. There are much better burger options (and values) in this city.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I've got to say I've been to many burger joints in my days but Big Juds takes the top spot easily. This is one of those small town joints that's been serving awesome burgers for many years. With this said, it's time for my play by play review.      Step 1: Burger              With this place being featured on Travel Channels Man v. Food and Chowdown Countdown you know your in for a treat. I happened to get the blue bacon burger which was amazing. It had a beautifully grilled patty, super crispy bacon, a nice slice of Swiss, and a gracious glob of grade A blue cheese. We also sampled the mushroom Swiss burger which was outstanding.       Step 2: the sides                At Big Juds, we really only had 3 sides to choose from which were Fries, Tater Tots, and onion rings. Naturally, we tried them all and fries were an easy winner. These super thick Idaho potato fries were just the right amount of crispy and soft. Not to mention the compliment to any side dish in the region, Fry Sauce. This regional condiment adds the perfect tang to any fry or side for that matter.        Step 3: Service                A bright young staff keeps this place going and the customers happy in the city of Boise. Very quick and efficient.   Overall, a great inexpensive stop that easily earns a five star rating",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Just finished a nice meal at CDB's and it was a good experience. The best part was the food, which is the best anyone can hope for at a restaurant. We ordered the Meat Lovers and the Bacon pizza along with a giant salad. Both pizzas were great and the salad was very unique. The downside was the darkness of the restaurant. I expected a bear to crawl out of a corner of the restaurant from hibernation at any point. So dark! Mix in a lamp or two. The wait staff was not overly friendly, but did get everything we asked for and took care of a bad soda mix for us.

Last time I was there I had the Alambre de filete and my husband had the Super Rica especial, so good! We each had a vegetable tamale. I absolutely adore the vegetable tamales! The only thing I can add is to avoid the long lines and crowds is to get here on a weekday between the lunch and dinner hours. It's usually very quiet and there's not much of a wait.

"I always forget that I really really really like this joint.  I was actually surprised that I had never penned a review.  We came here for a late lunch one day, which was great as there is usually a wait and we were hungry bordering on hangry.  I seriously should have eaten some crackers before I left the house because when we got here we practically ordered everything on the menu... although we had the intent of taking of food home so that is my excuse.  Ordered the Bollo Pasta, Boom Dip, Wings, Slice of Pizza and the El Diablo Shrimp Pasta.  My hubs polished off his El Diablo, lots of big shrimp with a kick so he was happy.  The wings were his too and he said they were pretty darn good.  I was munching on the homemade chips that came with it which were really good as well.  The pizza slice was very thin, and was actually two tasty slices.  I took two bites of the Bollo Pasta (and a bite of their delicious garlic bread) before it was going in a box.  The Boom Dip actually came late (they comped us, nice touch) and was divine.  They serve it with these thin garlicy bread things.  Obviously we took a bunch of food home.

"I currently travel to St. Louis for work and caught a bad cold so all I wanted was some noodle soup to warm me up and soothe my throat. Saw this place on yelp so I decided to try it. When I called in, I asked them what their best noodle soup is and he responded ""the tom yum!"" So tom yum is what I ordered in addition to a thai iced tea to meet the minimum delivery charge (long work days + down with a cold, I'm allowed to be lazy right?). Now I'll break it down.  Likes: - delivery was quick; they said 30 min, it came in 20. Pleasantly surprised - tom yum noodle soup portion was big. Couldn't finish it in one sitting  - i noticed that they actually provide you with a good amount of seafood. I'm used to getting gypped but this soup was overflowing with chicken, crab meat, shrimp, squid etc! To the extent of having too much - flavors were good, nothing was overpowering.    Dislikes: - I notice this with most noodle soup deliveries so it's not necessarily something I'll minus a star for but the noodles come all stuck together that you end up tearing chunks off and end up with short bits of noodles instead of long strands. Perhaps they can add a bit of sesame or olive oil to the noodle take out so that they don't all stick together? - thai iced tea could be renamed to ""ice and some tea."" Definitely more ice than thai tea. - slightly pricier than other thai places I've been to  Would def go back to try other items on their menu.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"WOW! Beer lovers rejoice! Wine lovers, fear not, they've got you covered too. It's evident that owners, Rebecca and Scott put a ton of thought into Tap & Bottle, which serves as a giant tasting room and retail shop. Given that it's a tasting room, there is no food for purchase, but the awesome thing, is that they encourage customers to bring in food and food trucks are making their rounds and setting up shop out front. Great solution for a place that only serves alcohol.  They've about 20 beers on tap and the selection rotates, meaning that if they run out of a certain beer, they'll quickly replace it with another and they even update their giant menu on the wall. The setup is incredibly smart and I was so pleased to see how quickly the menu board is updated. That's key in a place like this. Whether you're a beer novice or total connoisseur, there is a beer for you! I love the variety and the fact that they also feature local beer and wine. I especially like that they don't just carry local product for the sake of having something local. They pick carefully and their choices are top notch! Ever heard of a cask-conditioned beer? They have that too! Their attention to detail shows through and through. As each beer is served in its proper glassware.  If you'd rather enjoy your brew at home, head straight to the back for a diverse and global selection of beer and wine. Seriously, the options are endless.   Additionally, the interior rocks! It can get a little loud in there, but the atmosphere really lends itself for hanging out for a few hours. It feels like home. There's plenty of seating, but the place gets packed!  What makes this place extra awesome is their sense of community. Tap & Bottle will also serve as a place for special events as well as educational sessions.   Tap & Bottle is off to an excellent start. The staff is super friendly and with more product training (which is quite an undertaking with so much rotation), things will only run smoother. It would be a good idea to consider stocking napkins and basics for the food, even if they don't serve it.   Welcome to the scene Tap & Bottle!",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 5.0
I've never encounter such a horrific customer service while at a business. The hostess immediately allowed me to sit and even insisted red chairs were apart of the bar. In 15 minutes no one looked my directions nor stopped to offer a menu. I saved $25; thanks Dookey Chase.

"Well...this wax museum figures now feels like NashVegas! My first time in a wax museum. I was kinda freak out how real some of them looked, but really good art work. I had lots of fun taking pictures and acting on like they are real people. I guess this is the closes I will be to the stars if I can't see them in real life. It is Nashville! So expect to see country music stars. They have other souls and PoP singers, not just country music stars. Coming on a weekday we were the only ones inside and took our time. I think this place should be visited at least once if you haven't been in to see celebrities in wax figures.  Bought our tickets on Groupon for $12. Most definitely cheaper cost verse paying full price at the desk. Been to Vegas a few times but never wanted to pay full price for the entrance.  Things to do in Nashville this is the spot for me and my girlfriends on a rainy day. It was awesome and fun. Location inside Opry Mills mall made it convince.

"My 91 year old mother needed a new bed and because she liked JCPenney's I decided to go to their home store and get it. I tried out the mattress selected one and ordered a mattress a low profile box spring a mattress cover and a frame. Then the fun began. Several weeks later my mother called me and said the delivery men were there and they said where was the frame. They couldn't deliver the mattress or set it up without a frame so they had to take her new mattress and box spring and leave. I called the store and asked why no one had ordered a frame and they didn't know but it made a mistake. So I said I wanted to the frame and I didn't want to pay for it and I wanted the order delivered ASAP period weeks went by nothing happened except that one afternoon and someone drop something off in the lobby of her retirement home which is not supposed to be done without calling anyone. I called the store and they said that shouldn't have happened and they sent somebody over to pick up the item period several weeks went by and I heard nothing except that the delivery service called me and wanted to attempt to re deliver the mattress and box spring without the frame. I called the store and she said that I should call the delivery back and tell them not to do it until they had the frame. More time went by and Christmas was approaching and I wondered what was going on. So I went by the store because I couldn't get anybody on the phone. Lo and behold I found the mattress and box spring again we're going to be delivered without the frame the next day. I said why are we repeating what we've already tried twice and the salesman said he remember now the frame was in the store. I said why wasn't it delivered with the mattress and box spring and he actually had no good answer but promised to bring the frame by himself that day. The next day I went by my mother's retirement home and lo and behold the frame was not there no one knew anything about it. So as again the mattress and box spring we're going to be futilely delivered, I called the store got the supervisor and she said they delivered the frame to the wrong address. At that point I said cancel the whole order I want my money refunded and I want it refunded immediately. She said she would take care of it. Just before New Year's I called and asked where the refund was. The supervisor said she couldn't find out because the department was closed and she would call me back on Monday. I told her I wanted the refund immediately I didn't want to hear on Monday it would take 4 to 7 days. She called me Monday and after I pressed her she said it would take 4 to 7 days. I asked for the number of the general manager in Tucson left her a message and was soon called back by the supervisor promising the refund would be done the next day. I asked her why they hadn't done this originally a week and a half ago as I passed and she had no answer. In this entire transaction JCPenney was entirely unprofessional and incompetent. They simply don't listen to anything said to them they don't follow up and I was asked repeatedly to do their work for them. If I could give them minus five stars I would I can only say anyone who deals with JCPenney deserves what's coming to them.",Business Category: Home & Garden,Review Stars: 1.0

The place is small and dimly lit but the bartender was friendly and there were only a handful on people in the bar (locals mostly and they all knew each other).  The drinks were cheap (especially compared to CA prices) and we enjoyed chatting with the locals and having a few rounds before making our way to dinner.

"Would not recommend coming here. Hate to give businesses bad reviews but this one deserves it. Ordered chicken wings thinking how bad can they mess that up but they sure found a way. Order came out in 2-3 minutes which I thought was decent because I was starving. I ate one chicken wing and immediately knew they were not fully cooked. Chicken was hard and once I looked at it, the chicken was dripping blood.  I couldn't believe this. Servers all acted like they were blind to me needing attention till I had enough and got up to go to the front. I was told I had to speak with the manager before leaving. I spoke with the manager who wanted to see a visual of the wings before taking it off my bill. He said ""oh yeah these aren't cooked I can tell"" then took it to the chef. Came back out and said comp him for the wings which I still had to pay the measly coke I ordered which came to 3 dollars. Was not happy as I could get really sick from eating that crap they called food and they just want to act like it's okay. No apology no attempt to replace the meal.. Not that I wanted it but how they handled the situation was disappointing. I wouldn't recommend eating here as they didn't follow the proper food precautions and making sure the chicken thoroughly cooked..

I tried the special which was a buffalo pulled rib meat sandwich with a side of fries.  This was not only a unique sandwich (buffalo wing sauce cooked into the meat and topped with blue cheese coleslaw) but awesome at the same time.  The fries were good as well but the sandwich is something I recommend any BBQ lover try.

I love love love that they allow dogs, and my 4.5 month old pup had a grand old time exploring the ""wilderness.""  Just a warning-- When it is raining, or has been raining, some areas can get muddy and slick. We didn't explore every area and walk every trail, but it was fun nonetheless. The guides were really helpful, and told us which paths were muddier than others.  They allow us to bring outside food, and let us go in and out of the gates. After we walked around for a while, we went to the car and brought our ice chest in with our picnic goodies. There were several picnic areas, but only some of them have umbrellas to cover you if it is rainy.

Once moving into the concession area the same thing occurred with the lines being completely unsanctioned.  The parking out front is always full/reserved for handicapped parking which I like, but it'd be a good idea to make a note of that or put a larger sign up.  There is however free parking less than a block away under I-95 which is awesome and right next door is Warm Daddy's which has a solid happy hour!

This was our first visit (it won't be our last!) and I cannot recommend highly enough.  All this with an astoundingly reasonable prix fixe menu and BYO policy.  I would personally recommend the grilled avocado appetizer and the [jumbo] prawn entree.  Others at the table raved about the imported escargot, the vegetarian terrine, the pate de la maison.  Gorgeous desserts are made on the premises and somehow taste even better than they look.  My favorite was the creme br√ªl√©e, but our party of four sampled each one and cleaned the plates.

Checked into this hotel and after walking down a very long, poorly lit hallway we were given an adjoining join which had no lock on it, only an old fashion chain lock which was halfway pulled off already. Room very dated and sheets were stained. I was staying with my 2 daughters so immediately went to front desk to change rooms. Was switched to a first floor room, again at the end of a long dark hallway, right next to the exit door to a dark alley in which the lock was broken out of. ANYONE could walk in from outside.  Got in room and there were roaches on the floor.  Immediately checked out !  Front desk did not seem surprised.  Unfortunately booked with Hopper, so now have to fight it out with them for refund!  Hopper only had good reviews on their site which is very misleading. If you look on google reviews you will find many bad reviews!

"This used to be the most relaxing and fabulous spa around.  I went back today for the first time in over a year. The attention to detail and the focus on the experience has dropped significantly.   It used to be the moment you walked in the front door , you were immediately transported into a state of relaxation with spa like smells and sounds.  Now when you walk in you are immediately bombarded with a pop of retail shop in the lobby.  This is not the first impression I expected walking in and it did not set the tone for a relaxing experience.   The attention to detail in the locker room and transition room was seriously lacking.  The shower did not drain, so I was left standing in a pool of water.  The luxurious hand soaps have been swapped out for some bargain economy size soap.  The bathrobes are no longer soft and plush.   The shower curtains are sheer and falling apart ... Leaving one feeling exposed .   The transition room had 1 magazine .  That someone else was already reading.  The foot soak was warm when started but turned cold before anyone came back to check on us.  The seat cushions in the transition room were old and dilapidated , and so worn out there were actually holes in them.  The coffee and tea machine was out of order.    Everyone was polite but the staff was certainly not as helpful or focused as they used to be.  Everyone seemed very young and had a certain look about them  but lacked the ability to connect to the customers.   There were 2 positive points ....they did offer a mimosa and my massage therapist did a good job.  It was my first time with her and I was pleased with her work.   I feel strongly that the full experience is what used to make this place amazing.  You can get a good massage many places.  The experience is what used to set this place apart .  Not any more.

I wish I could give 3.5 stars because this is what I believe Taylor's Pub truly deserves, but alas... gotta go with the three.

We got both spicy mustard and nacho cheese - nacho cheese dip was so good. Pretzel breadsticks were meh. Not enough salt on them.. pretty much just tasted like fried dough, so it was a bit disappointing.   For my main meal, I got the California Veggie Burger with waffle fries. So, I like black bean burgers, but this pretty much tasted like they warmed up a Boca black bean burger and slapped it on a skinny bun with guacamole. I mean, it wasn't bad, but I could've done this in my own kitchen for about $2. The waffle fries were good.. I mean, how can you really mess up waffle fries?   There wasn't anything *bad* about the food, but also..nothing really great either.  I did really like the atmosphere. It was very much a neighborhood bar with little pretentiousness. And the trivia was super fun too! Also, a decent selection of local draft beers.   I would definitely go back to play trivia again, and keep trying food off the menu in the hopes of striking gold.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 3.0
"Booked a last-minute appointment on a Sunday to get my hair buzzed because I have cancer and am having chemo and my hair has started falling out. Alexandra was available.  I told her I wanted my (long) hair completely buzzed to about a quarter of an inch. She was dubious but agreed to it.  Long story short, she actually ended up giving me a very short cut but not buzzing it - leaving a little length on top. Of course I hate it (no offense, it's a great cut, I just didn't want short hair!), but everyone else says it looks terrific. I think she made the right call leaving some length, plus she was super sweet and supportive as I cried through half the cut.  In the end, we went up to check out and discovered that they comped me the cut. I burst into tears.  I love the east coast. Thank you, Alexandra, and thank you, Joseph Anthony. What a kind gesture. I'd go here again in a heartbeat.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 5.0

"In my opinion Thai Sweet Basil (TSB) is one of the best Thai restaurants in town, and worth the drive to sample their cuisine. You'll find TSB in the Northdale / northern Carrollwood area of Hillsborough County. This little gem is located in a strip mall across the street from Whole Foods on Northdale Blvd. From the outside, this is a tiny little store-front, and the inside of the restaurant is narrow, but it's deep with seating for about 30 - 40 people.  The interior decorations are simple, but the staff is super friendly, and the food is outstanding. Thai Sweet Basil opens for lunch at 11am with a special discounted lunch menu with everything under $10. Then they re-open at 4pm for dinner Monday - Saturday and close up by 10pm.  The menu starts with the usual selection of Asian Spring Roll appetizers, dumplings, vegetable tempura, and chicken satae. From there you'll find some tasty salads with papaya and mango, as well as hot & spicy Thai salads. I'm a big fan of Tom Yum soup, and TSB makes some of the very best with a delicious flavor profile in their broth, and a nice kick with the Thai chilis. They also have coconut milk soup, wonton, and a spicy beef soup that will bring tears to your eyes.  TSB's menu also has some delicious curries (red, green, Panang, yellow, and Massamum) cooked with chicken, beef, pork, tofu, vegetables, shrimp, or seafood. Stir-fried platters with a wide variety of sauces and seasonings; and finally some noodle and fried-rice dishes. Lots of creativity with their choices, and the servers will gladly help you pick something that will appeal to your taste buds. If you're looking for something a bit more special they have several dishes with duck, snapper, scallops, and soft shell crab.  The staff can help you to navigate the menu and try a few new treats, or just enjoy a familiar Thai dish. Be careful with the ""heat"" if you're not used to Thai Hot. You might want to order your dish a bit more mild, and then ask for the hot sauce on the side.  If you're a big fan of Thai food, or just trying something different for the first time, I highly recommend making the drive up Dale Mabry into Northdale and enjoying a meal at Thai Sweet Basil.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I can't understand the overall stars of this place!! We live right down the road and go here ALL the time. We have rarely ever had less than a 5* meal unless it was a crazy busy night and the server made a mistake which has maybe happened to us twice in the over 50 (at least!!) times we have dined here. The bartenders are amazing, George is so friendly and always remembers us and makes us feel welcome. The food is great. Love, love, love their black bean burger. French onion soup is a must. Salads are great and fresh. Bread and butter is awesome. They have a great drink selection, desserts, etc... you name it, we have probably tried it. I was recently put on bed rest and unable to cook/dine out so my husband picked us up takeout from the bar here a few times and it was great! Same great food, but at home. We love BPT. Don't listen to the negative reviews! Make a reservation on open table or go and sit at the bar and say hi to George!

"So excited about this new restaurant! Staff was friendly upon our walk-in and were very accommodating with our seating request (we have small children).  Waters were served right away and the drinks we received were awesome! Fresh squeezed grapefruit juice for my greyhound and the perfectly poured martinis with fresh and crisp onions. My second cocktail came twice the size as the first, which they may want to streamline with the bartenders, but both tasted fantastic.  Our kids ate the Mac and cheese and inhaled it! Ok, we helped, we couldn't help ourselves...  We wanted to check out so many items on the menu that we decided to order the BBQ sampler which comes with your choice of three of the meats. We chose pork ribs, brisket, and the pulled pork. We finished the plate! Their house made bbq sauces were awesome, I preferred the beer battered sauce.  We also ordered their Caesar Salad which had a BBQ flavored smoky twist with brisket on top. Delicious!!   The old school bluesy rock and roll music along with the hum of the busy diners made it a truly an amazing experience.  The restaurants design is warm and inviting with rustic raw wood and brick walls. You can see right into the kitchen and watch them prepare the food.  Restrooms were clean and tech forward. Back patio is adorable and inviting with a gorgeous view of the courtyard between them and The Mill.  Lastly, the manager, Adam, is walking around to the tables and checking in with the guests, refilling waters, and clearing where necessary. A true manager!

The Calamari Rings are light and slightly crispy...delicious. My wife also loves the seaweed salad.  The Bugs Bunny has a nice thick slice of salmon with avocado and crab topping; The Joint always adds a drop hot sauce to finish it off; this is my favorite at The Joint. They do a good job with the upside down shrimp as well.  The Escape has an honest portion of tuna on top, but the Highway, (their version of the mountain roll), seems a little skimpy and tired.

"Really? Grey line, the bus company offers tours?  Sure!  Bottom line, I was a tourist walking near Cafe Du Monde and stumbled upon their ticket booths.  I'm glad I did because I decided to randomly book a ticket to the Swamp/Plantation tour that day. It's approximately 5 hours and you have to play it by ear because some are cancelled due to rainy weather. The bus left from the Steamboat area and drove us to the plantation within an hour.  I'm lucky that it wasn't that crowded in December too because we were able to move quickly and learn so much from the docents.  Our group spent about 2 1/2 hours on the plantation including 1/2 hour of free time and then headed to the swamp for another 1 1/2 hours.

"I experienced my first air brush tan this past Sunday. I have been a pretty loyal tan towel user but was looking for something that wouldn't rely on my own mediocre (sometimes streaky and uneven) application skills. I pass by the Bronzed airbrush tanning salon daily on my way to work. I thought it might be a nice solution for summer events where I might wear some bright colored open back dresses etc. I decided to give it a test run last weekend. I knew going in that I needed to go with the express version - mostly because I don't trust myself to not get wet or sweaty for 10 whole hours.       The young lady who assisted me was very helpful and personable- I think she would make most people feel comfortable in this potentially awkward situation. The whole salon was very clean and comfortable. The air brush spray is COLD but it's pretty fast and most beauty routines require a bit of suffering...so no big deal. If you are an air brush tan virgin, be aware that you need to dedicate a few hrs (or several for the standard tan) to this skin dying experience. I wasn't aware that the darkening of the solution is time dependent. Luckily, I was able to schedule a shower in 2.5 hrs to achieve the suggested medium level tan- if I had tried to have my spray tan, say, before work, this might have been a disaster.      Now, the only reason I'm not giving the full 5 stars? Without peeking in the mirror, I foolishly decided to run a few errands after my tan despite feeling a little greasy and sticky.... I got home about an hour later and my husband couldn't stop laughing because the solution on my skin (especially my face) made me a funny exaggerated  ""snookie"" color until I rinsed it off at the prescribed time.  Note to self: go straight home after your spray tans.     To my relief, after the initial shower, the tan looked great. The color was even and looked very natural. It may have been slightly lighter on my face than my body but that just may have been my own oiliness inhibiting the tan from soaking in as well. I would definitely recommend Bronzed to my friends and have already made a second appointment!",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 4.0

The food was fantastic, as I have come to expect from Mark Estee.  The prix fixe menu ($80/couple) was creative, thoughtful and well presented.  It started with oysters with a mignonette sauce and shrimp cocktail - both were fresh and delicate yumminess.  For the first course we both chose the cauliflower bisque with salmon roe.  Holy cow - so creamy and the roe added the perfect pop of salt.  For the entree, my husband ordered the sirloin with crispy potato gratin and cabbage and I chose the porcini dusted scallops over a wild mushroom risotto with truffled potato chips (OH YES).  Fresh, tender, and perfectly seasoned.  For dessert, cream puffs with a decadent chocolate sauce and the lightest, melt-in-your-mouth meringue hearts.  We chased it all down with their delicious Hub coffee.  Indeed, we rubbed our bellies lovingly.    Service was also phenom - from accommodating our changing reservations to knowing the menu, the staff took great care of us.

"One of my favorite spots for brunch in the Tampa Bay area (if I said this about any other brunch spot in previous reviews, disregard). If the weather is nice, 70-80 degrees, low humidity, Catch 23 is ideal. Probably one of the better patio areas around, and the surrounding community is one of the nicest areas you can find. If you're nosey and into people watching, like myself, then this place is even better because its located in the heart of Westchase Village, which is a thriving community full of happy people walking their dogs...it's like something out of a bad sit-com. Really nice environment never-the-less.   But back to Catch 23, and what makes this place so great...$9 B O T T O M L E S S M I M O S A S! Pardon my enthusiasm, but it's a deal you cannot beat. Usually the service is pretty good, translation - attentive to whether my glass is empty or not. I've brought groups of 6-7 here before, and this is one of those brunch spots that's a pretty fun for group of people...considering the OJ and Champagne pouring.   As far as the food goes, it holds its own, and definitely keeps me coming back for more. I've ordered everything from the Breakfast Flatbread (Pizza), to the Seafood Omelet. However, most recently I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict and it was seriously delicious. Catch 23 specializes in their Seafood, so having a fresh Crab Cake served certainly made all of the difference here. The Hollandaise sauce wasn't overbearing, and it provided enough flavor throughout the serving. I would also recommend their Chicken and Waffle, which would be another great item here.

We also split a glass of the Zaca Mesa Grenache blend (Rhone style) as we had a bottle of wine open at the hotel. Again there was no issue as the waiter nicely served the wine in to glasses. No looks at us as if we were being cheap or anything.  The bread that is served with dinner is great as is the olive oil and balsamic that is the table.  For the main course my wife had the Tagliolini del Campo, which is a ribbon like pasta with leeks, spinach, green beans and Parmesan cheese. It was so good.  I had the duck ravioli. Best ravioli ever. Really. Go here and order this.  For dessert we ha the lemon torte with white chocolate. Tart and sweet beautiful to look at.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Oh my have the lines at this establishment gotten longer and longer over the years! And for good reason, one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten. Their bread is great, their meat is juicy and their provolone cheese is nice and sharp. In my personal opinion, though, its those toppings that sell it for me every time. The broccoli rabe, the spinach, even the roasted peppers are incredible, very heavy on the garlic and a little red pepper flake. The best greens served at any of the Philly sandwich shops. I also love the atmosphere, but unlike my wife, I am not adverse to crowds, if you are, the Reading Terminal Market will drive you crazy!  Still, however, I have to rank it below Tony Luke's and John's on the roast pork, even though the bread and toppings and atmosphere might be better here. Its just the meat is not better, its close and really good, but not. Tony Luke's meat is a tad bit juicer and John's is a tad bit more flavorful. All in all, however, you simply cannot go wrong with a roast pork sandwich here (or roast beef)..   What this place does have going for though is its the Italian-style pulled pork. Now this is some incredible stuff and I highly recommend it. Top it with greens and sharp provolone, just like a roast pork sandwich, and its probably one of the best sandwiches I have ever had and blows away any cheesesteak.  Before it closed, i used to laugh at the suckers lined up at Rick's for a cheesesteak, did they not know about DiNic's a few rows down?  Unlike the brisket sandwich here, the pulled pork lacks any and all BBQ/tomato/smoke flavor. Its pretty much very moist pulled pork with a hint of Italian seasonings. It is divine. I am not a huge fan of the brisket sandwich, although I know many who are. The sausage is also good, but not many order it here with so many other outstanding options. For me 9 times out of 10 its the Italian-style pulled pork... mmmm....  TIP: If your with three people or less why not sit and eat? You don't have to wait in that long line to order, just wait for someone to get up and sit down. Also they do run out of food sometimes later int he day, best to try and get here before 2:00 if you are making a trip.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Definitely glad to see a growing healthy food scene in Indianapolis. CoreLife has a huge menu with just about anything for anyone, with any dietary restriction, or any craving. The veggies and meat has always been super fresh during my visits, and they don't skimp on the portions. I'm still working my way through the menu and trying to figure out my favorites. I'd be lying if I said everything is amazing, but to each their own. I've had the Tuna Poke Grain Bowl and a Chicken Rice Noodle Bowl and both of those missed the mark for me. Good potential but just kind of bland, needed to be more seasoned or saucier. The Spicy Chicken Rice Bowl has been my absolute favorite.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Been coming to this location for a little over about a year now. There are Good and bads about stores, this store is nice but it does have some flaws dont get me wrong it is in a mall, and for the space that they are given they do what they can with what they have.   Now! 2 reasons why I enjoy this location is because of 2 members. Grant & Jen. Grant has been with GS for a while I remember meeting him up in Carson City. Jen ive known for a few months very friendly and they go out of their way to serve a customer to the fullest extent. Perfect Customer Service.  Now! 2 reasons I kinda not like this location is it is small, and some of the other staff kinda hover to much. I know they have a job to fulfill but once youve told a guest your specials and if they need anything you could give them time to browse but not hover over them.  But with the bads, the two staff who go beyond for customers make it a 5 star experience.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 5.0
"Being a new homeowner, I've been to this Home Depot more in the past 4 months than I have ever in my life.  Sure, it's a hit or miss on the customer service, but the hits are what make it a 4-star. When I'm standing in the trimmer section and quickly a worker walks up to me and we chat for about 15-20 minutes about the right one for me (I had an idea as I looked a bunch up online first) and showed me how to use this and that and all the in's and outs, I really appreciated that.  They have DIY workshops here (more of less a guy from HD standing out ready for questions), but was very helpful with talking about starter, grass seed, garden soil and all that fun jazz.   I've also picked up from here an extension ladder, toilet seats, nails/ screws, a cool kitchen mat, the outdoor mat 'wipe your paws' that I was searching hi and low for.. and all comparable pricing to other hardware stores.  Currently they have mulch for cheap and some lovely plants.

"Very accommodating! I came with a party of 8 people during graduation weekend. With no reservations to any restaurants, our party decided to call every restaurant on State street. With the help of a fellow yelper and friend Sonia H., we were able to get a table at State & Fig. The hostess warned us beforehand the only available table was outside and they had no heatlamp. Not phased, we decided to take this table. The food was pretty good. I ordered the braised beef short ribs, and it was definitely tender as I did not have to use my knife at all!!!! However, because it was so cold outside, my dish got cold really fast, and it became less appealing as it got colder. So my advice to State & Fig is to set up a canopy area (like the restaurant next door) for the outdoor seating and add heat lamp. Until then, I am keeping 1 stars from you!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I think the problem with this place is they don't have the technical skills and ability to cook well, nothing was NASTY, I didn't find hair in my food, they got the order correct, my issue is everything I ordered was cooked in a below avareage manner, what I mean by that is there was absolutely zero flavor, they lack the ability to put love into the dishes, it's like they are just mailing it in, because no cook or chef with any type of skill or integrity would cook in such a uninspired and tepid manner,which leads me to believe that the problem is that whoever cooked my food just doesn't have the skill level and knowledge to pull it off.  To say I was disappointed would be a understatement and the fact that this place has 4 stars is a travesty because either the yelpers have never tasted good Chinese food or they must have been training a new guy or something...sigh...I wanted to like this place sooooooo bad but at the end of the day you can not fake delicious, this place SUCKS and they can't cook and I will die on that hill.

"I came here with my family last year and my husband this year. It's so much fun to eat in here. The food is pretty good but it can be bland at times.   Last year, I got the Pastalaya and it was spicy but had no flavor. I've been told it may have been an off day and I should try it again but it's so expensive and we rarely come here so I probably won't unless I find myself here a lot.   We also got the Sparkling Volcano last year and it was delicious. Of course, the most entertaining part is screaming ""Volcaaaaaanoooooooo"" with everyone in the restaurant like they do every time they bring one out.  This year my husband and I shared the Lava Nachos and the Rasta Pasta (with added sausage). Both were excellent and filling. My husband also got the Iceblaster Cherry and enjoyed it. It's enjoyable to sit and watch the animals move whenever a ""thunderstorm"" comes through. Our waiter, Robert, was very good as well.   My family will be back eventually.

The zingers are great and putting them in a salad is a plus, giant mozzarella sticks, loaded fries being finished off in the oven, nicely done.   Sitting at the bar or one of the communal tables, the service has been a hit or miss. But when you do get a server who wants to be personable, interactive, and awesome at their job it certainly makes it more enjoyable.  Great mix of people, music is fun and at the right volume.

"My husband and I really enjoyed the Ghost Hunt. I was a little nervous at first, being the sort of person who reads every review before deciding what to do on our vacation, and there were a ton of bad reviews.  Some points were valid. The guide could have been a bit more knowledgeable about ghost hunting techniques (for example, she got a bit flustered when we asked if we should take pics with or without flash to get ghost phenomenon), but was entertaining overall, and had great anecdotes about spooky events in the city. She also coped really well with a young man on the tour who seemed to enjoy poking fun at her in general. If you're into the bloodier and less PG aspects of history, I recommend reading up on some of the stories before the tour, or chatting with the guide one-on-one between locations. I suspect that some of the stories were watered down a bid due to some kids in our group.   My favorite part was the Powell house, where the live-in care taker had great personal stories about some strange happenings in the house. We got a ton of great mists and orbs, and had a blast walking around the city at night.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 4.0

(Which makes the overall portion less.) pretty SNEAKY restaurant.

"Went to Stacky's this week for some hoagies. When I arrived, I saw a sign that said they were ""back."" A patron leaving said they had closed, but re-opened under new ownership. I asked if the stuff was still the same, he said (emphatically) better. He said the place is cleaner, and the pulled pork sandwiches are superb.  While I can't comment on the pork sandwiches (yet), I can tell you about the hoagies I got. I come there for the Italian Special, which has thinly sliced sharp provolone and prosciutto as well as other hoagie meats.  The hoagies were maybe the best I ever had from there, and that's saying something. Everyone who tried them raved except my girlfriend, who complained they had ""too much meat."" Don't put much stock in that, she's from Rochester NY, and wouldn't know a great hoagie if it mugged her in the street. :v)  Everyone from the region who tried a Stacky's Italian Special will attest it doesn't get better. Without a doubt, this is the best hoagie in the region that I know of. If there's better, I haven't tried it yet. Primo's and Co. don't compare. GF was right about one thing- the rolls are just OK. If it was on a Sarcone's roll, it might be too overwhelming, and leave the eater faint and disoriented.

"I went here with my father today and I liked what I got - the Roast Turkey Dinner. I wanted to get it with a baked potato and carrot + celery sticks but apparently they don't start making the baked potatoes until 3 PM or so. I found it a little weird, but not a huge deal, so I went with the mashed potatoes instead.  They put the gravy on the side instead of drowning the turkey in it, which I thought was kind of neat since I had gone to another diner (Four Seasons) and they pretty much drowned the turkey in gravy.  They gave me an extremely generous portion of ranch dressing for the carrots and celery. It seemed somewhat wasteful to me - I think they gave me the same amount of dressing as they did turkey gravy. Maybe it was a mistake.  Also they have mint chocolate chip milkshakes, which to me is a rarity since most places only seem to have vanilla, chocolate, and occasionally strawberry. I guess it's possible this flavor is more common in 40s/50s inspired diners. I don't go to enough of them to know for sure.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

The place is in a shopping center, so the parking lot is shared with multiple businesses. Easy to find a spot when I went. The restaurant itself makes me think of a taqueria with a salsa bar, except tamales are their main thing. They have quite a variety to choose from and they do them well.  I remember I got the blue corn and Santa Fe tamales. There was one more, but I don't recall which it was. Two were filling enough, so I had to take the last one for the road, but this is exactly what I was looking for when I think 'local favorite.' I even gushed to my mom how good it was since I was on a roadtrip across the US. If only they could ship these out!

June 3rd, on my husband's birthday, it was spectacular and my review reflected that.  6 months later on December 16th it was one of the WORST meals I have ever had and not just at a Ruth's Chris, but ANYWHERE.  Even the service was far below par as we waited on 6 occasions for more iced tea. To their credit, they did make sure my acorn squash soup was HOT, sadly it had literally no flavor. It tasted like pureed baby food garnished with crunchy undercooked squash dice and 4 pumpkin seeds.

The opposite was true of the mushroom couscous that was served so cold that I put it on my smoking hot steak plate to warm it up. It was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!  There was an ocean's worth of SALT and enough garlic to wipe out a platoon of vampires and it was swimming in a pool of grease that I couldn't discern the origin to be olive oil or butter due to the un-effing-believable amount of garlic and salt.  I did, however, use it to season the totally flavorless steak that had NO seasoning whatsoever--they just couldn't be bothered apparently so my husband and I used tiny bits of the chewy UNDERCOOKED fish-eye textured couscous to season the tasteless steaks.  As for the steaks, you need a new butcher fellas.  I've never had gristle in a filet ANYWHERE they were charging $59 for 11 oz of steak until last night.  At Ruth's Chris. On my birthday.  One more thing.  When I tell you I don't want the crappy birthday bread pudding and chocolate mousse, DO NOT BRING IT TO THE TABLE.  Every one of us had dessert that we either ordered or it came with the dinner--and two of the three of us are diabetics and I am not supposed to eat sugar but because it was my birthday I indulged in the creme brulee as a special treat.  It was a mistake.  The creme brulee was mushy and grainy--everything it is NOT SUPPOSED TO BE.  It was without a doubt the worst food and service I have EVER had at ANY Ruth Chris Steak house in the United States. But wait--there's MORE!! Luckily they seated us right NEXT to the waiter station so we were entertained by the shop talk all night because these guys couldn't stop yapping with each other at high volume 28 INCHES from our table.  It was the worst dining experience I've ever had and it's inexcusable in a restaurant at this price point.  The Ruth's Chris in Baton Rouge was just named one of the 100 best restaurants in America (deservedly so), and that's where we normally dine.  The Ruth's Chris in Clayton Missouri couldn't win a spot on America's 100 best truck stops!!  Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.  We stopped patronizing the downtown RC because of the same lack of professionalism and culinary competence.  We won't be going back to this one for the same reason--It's just not worth the drive, the time or the money--and it's a LOT of money for a substandard meal and a substandard dining experience.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

Our first visit to this location was at lunch during the Gateway Cup so I don't believe that the level of service is a good indicator of what is normal.  I ordered the house Chardonnay and it was very good.  I became very tipsy from two servings.  We ordered the toasted raviolis and those tasted fine but I did find a hair in the marinara sauce.  I ordered the carbonara and the taste was good but there was too much sun-dried tomato.  My husband ordered the Pasta con broccoli and was pleased.  Each plate was large and we both had leftovers.  I did wish that we had a bread or some breadsticks to go with the large amount of sauce on each dish.,Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0
"Really disappointed.  I was staying in a hotel close by and wanted good Thai or Vietnamese food.  Saw that this was relatively close so decided to try it out.  I ordered Crab Rangoon, based on other yelpers' recommendation, mussamun curry and mango sticky rice for dessert. My initial grossness was fighting off the gnats.  I found one in my curry, killed a second and kept swatting at a 3rd that was challenging my every bite.  The curry, I ordered medium to be on the safe side.  I should have ordered at least hot because it had no taste.  Normally I would be licking my dish, but could only manage to eat a third of it.  I had to wait at least 5 minutes for the rice to be delivered so it cooled off substantially during the wait and was only lukewarm.  I'll try this again, maybe on a busier night, but as some folks mentioned, there are way too many other great places to eat.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Depending on when you go, you can do all-you-can-eat sushi for only $19-$23/per person.  A great date night spot if you're looking for a low-key hang out spot.  After 5pm, this place is packed.  Get there early enough so that you don't have to wait.    You choose your selections from laminated menus that are brought to your table.  There's a sheet for appetizers, soups, etc. and a few for the sushi rolls (raw or cooked).  Tons of options to choose from!  My husband and I always order a few crab rangoon to get us started while we choose our sushi rolls.  We usually pick about 4 to start with since most of them are 8-piece sushi rolls.    Trust me, go hungry or it's not worth it.  If you choose all-you-can-eat, take advantage of it!  But, don't leave more than 5 pieces at the end, or you will be charged for it.

"I want to be very clear that this review is entirely based on my experience with Ellen, one of the managers at Herbology on Passyunk Avenue in South Philadelphia.   At my last visit to the dispensary, I was told upon arrival that they were helping patients place their orders via ipad in the waiting area & then calling them back to complete their purchase, to avoid wait & manage social distancing for COVID. The employee showed me their flower selection via tablet, I told them what I was looking for in strength & terp profile, & we selected a flower strain based on the information on the tablet re: the THC level & terpene profile -- despite it being a grower I'd not purchased from before, & it being one of the highest price-point flowers on the menu. I was then called to the back, paid for my purchase (& was told that customers are not permitted to touch anything prior to purchase), & left the dispensary.   Upon arriving home & examining the label on the flower, I saw that the information on the label did not match the information on the tablet. The THC level was off by nearly 4%, the terp levels were significantly lower than advertised.   I then called the dispensary & explained what had happened, & was transferred to Ellen, one of the managers. Ellen told me that the information on the website was controlled ""by corporate"" & they had no power to change it. I said that I understood this, but that no one told me that when they were using the website information to direct my purchase. Ellen then said it was my fault for not checking the label before I purchased the flower. I reminded Ellen that this wasn't possible, since I'd been told that customers are currently not allowed to touch products due to COVID precautions. I told Ellen that I rely on the information provided to select the strains to manage my chronic illness (& that medical marijuana is just that: medicine), & that I would not have made the purchase had the information been accurate, & asked how to prevent this from happening again.   Ellen then raised her voice & began yelling at me that she had done nothing wrong, & that she could tell I am a ""detail-oriented person"" but that there was ""nothing in it that's going to hurt you"" & ""no one forced you to buy it."" & then she hung up on me.   I was & am well aware that an exchange or return would not be possible, given that the purchase was medicine, & communicated this -- my question was: how did this happen, & how can I keep it from ever happening again. I expected something along the lines of: ""Hey, we're sorry that happened -- the website information isn't always updated, & we'll be careful to remind folks to double-check before completing their purchase so we can catch discrepancies. We're adding 5 loyalty points to your account for the inconvenience."" Instead, I was yelled at, told it was my fault, & then hung up on. By Ellen.  I have been a patient-client at Herbology on Passyunk since they opened their doors, & found this interaction stunning. No one else I've ever worked with there would suggest that I treat my medicine so cavalierly. No one else I've ever encountered there has been anything but helpful, conscientious, & responsible in their recommendations. Shout out to Ajay, Bill, Matt, & Mike especially for always being helpful & professional & friendly in my interactions with them there. Their customer service is impeccable.  I have not heard back from anyone at Herbology or Curaleaf HQ, so I have gone to the dispensary, cashed out the 37 loyalty points on my account, & will not be returning after my encounter with Ellen.   Ethos Dispensary has better product, a wider selection, longer hours, & a superior online ordering system that allows you to pre-order even when the dispensary is closed. The only reason I've been frequenting Herbology on Passyunk is because the team members mentioned above are such lovely humans.  The only reason I will not be returning is the way that I was treated by Ellen.",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 1.0

"So, came home to Tucson to visit and definitely had to stop by Mi Nidito. From what I remembered their food was really good and I couldn't wait to come and eat here again. So here goes...  There was a wait for our group of 6 (as expected), and was told it would be 30 minutes before we could get a table. Doesn't sound too bad. Well, 30 minutes turned into an hour and 10 minutes. NO BUENO...   The food was just okay, but nothing special, not how I really remembered it. Tucson has a ton of great Mexican food restaurants and food trucks littered throughout the city that offer more of an authentic dining experience. I guess it's safe to say, not always the most ""well known"" place in the city offers the best food. Save your money and try one of the food trucks that are also down Tucson's historic 4th avenue.

"My friend and I stopped by last Thursday, before the Roberta Flack concert, to grab a bite to eat. before eating here, we were unfamiliar with them as I rarely venture to Clearwater, with the exception of fishing /or the beach, and only occassionally, for concerts.  The exterior is warm and inviting, with some outdoor seating ala sidewalk cafe, and inviting signage. Inside...well, that's another story.  The inside is rather bare bones, with a couple of oddly placed prints, adorning the walls, and a bar in the back (with a few rather loud, inebruated individuals.  The greeter sat us rather quickly, handing us each a menu, and scooted away. Now, regarding this, let me elaborate. My dining partner is blind, and uses a standard white cane with a red tip, so it's faily obvious. Why is it that restaurants are not training their employees regarding disabled people? I can not tell you how many times people try to hand her a menu, etc and this was no exception. Even when explaining that we only needed a single menu, I was met with a confused look until I reitterated that she is blind, and can not see said menu. Of course, no mention/offer of a braile menu was made.  The menu offered a variety of dishes and pizza, but offered no reduced portions (lunch/or senior), which I found to be odd. I also found it odd that the meals were not accompanied by a salad, of some sort. This has to be the first Italian eaterie I have ever been to, in my 48 years, that did not offer a salad with their entrees.  While we waited for our meal, a small loaf of italian bread with a plate of olive oil was brought to our table. The bread was still warm (a plus) and the oil tasted pretty good.  The food arrived about 20 minutes later. My friend opted for the ravioli in meat sauce, while I chose the pepperoni calzone. My friend's ravioli looked fairly appetizing, served in medium sized shallow bowl, with chopped parsley along the bowl's rim. The filling was pretty tastey, and the sauce had a slight sweetness to it, but was a bit one dimensional. The calzone....well, it was pretty small; about the size of a pan pizza. Plenty of cheese and pepperoni, but definitely the smallest calzone I have ever eaten, and just didn't offer ""bang for the buck"", in my opinion.  The waiter was attentive, and kept our drinks refilled, etc and was a pleasant enough gentleman.  Now, the biggest complaint(s)... First, the layout was a nightmare to wade through, even for a sighted person. As I mentioned, my friend is blind, and I am a disabled vet, with a hip and knee injury, so it is difficult for us to fit through small, narrow, winding walkways, etc.  We had to weave between tables to navigate to the restrooms, as the tables are jammed directly in the walking area (in order to fit more people, is my guess). It was almost impossible to get her through that maze without her running into something/someone. Definitely NOT wheelchair friendly! If you are in a wheelchair, use a walker, are pretty much have any kind of physical limitation, you should avoid this place.  Secondly (and this ticked me off, greatly), our table was cleared, before we were finished. While I was escorting my friend through the aforementioned maze, and in spite of the fact we left personal property at the table, and in spite of the fact that she had only eaten a half of her dinner, someone saw fit to remove our plates, and silverware, yet, for some reason, left our drinks... When we returned, the greeter apologized and stated she was told by the waiter to clear the table. My friend was offered a dessert, which she refused as she wanted food, not sweets, and unfortunately, we did not have anymore time to wait for a replacement order. The best part (sarcasm) was that we were not even offered a percentage off of our ticket...nothing. So in essence, we paid about $26 (not including a tip) for a tiny calzone and half a plate of ravioli (and a glass of water and a glass of soda).  It is confusing as to what Tony's was going after: casual dining or upscale. Their prices are a bit high for a casual establishment, yet their aesthetics and service is too lacking for an upscale place, and definitely does not warrant the price.  All in all, rather disappointed in the entire experience, and do not see myself returning nor recommending this place to my friends.... and, seriously, if you have a disability, avoid this place, it will just be a frustrating nightmare for you.  You are better off going to Olive Garden...the food tastes about the same, the portions are bigger, and they are more disabled-friendly.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 2.0

"I was craving Asian cuisine yesterday at lunchtime and decided to check out this new restaurant. I'm totally on a rice noodle kick lately, so pho sounded like what I was needing.  I enjoyed the Oxtail Pho. It was amazing! I have had some pho before and really liked it, but this is totally on another level in my experience.  I have heard often about people really needing pho when they are not feeling well and I always just thought, true... it would be good for those times just like a good chicken noodle soup. BUT, after having pho there at 999 Pho... I totally get it! Yes, their pho would do wonders when you are not feeling good pho sure!   ;)    I did have a bit of trouble taking some bites of the oxtail, but I am sure that was mainly ""user error"". I have never had oxtail before and with only a fork, chopsticks, and one of their spoons....I wasn't very successful.  lol  I will likely get a different type of pho next time and YES there will most definitely be a next time. I'm a bit leary of the rare meat that is in most of their pho that has a combination of meats, but I might just get adventurous next time. They also have more common types of pho, too, but none with shrimp or any seafood (my only ""complaint"").  I asked my server Tom if all of the pho comes with the sliced white onion like the oxtail one does and he said yes and you can even ask for extra. I might just do that. It was part of what I think took it up several notches. That and their delicious broth. Oh my!   Tom did a wonderful job. He explained a couple of things to me from the menu, checked on me just the correct amount of times, and was personable.   I would love to give them 6 stars, because it obviously was a huge hit with me, but also for the fact that Tom and a couple of others had to deal with a group that were just terrible. Fortunately, they arrived only about 10 minutes before I left. They were really getting on my last nerve, but Tom and co-workers were handling it really well.   The woman with the group kept talking down to him, making extreme changes to all of their dishes, and then talking loudly about how incompetent he and the restaurant was including problems she saw in the semantics of what he said when confirming all of her changes.   The problem was her totally. Tom has a bit of an accent, but is extremely easy to understand and is obviously quite intelligent. No language barrier AT ALL. I think she was working on her excuse not to tip or to try to get something free. He remained calm and pleasant though. I was sure to tip well and tell two of his co-workers about how great of a job he did.  999 Pho is located in the Franktown Corners shopping center.

"Nothing more appetizing than eating after washing bird feces out of your hair.  This place has a horrible bird problem on the main level deck.  Not only were we defecated on, the birds are deafening loud.  All in all, doesn't make for a pleasant dining experience.  You can tell this place is a tourist magnet and doesn't have to rely on wonderful service, clean bathrooms or great food to survive.   If you must eat here for the amazing sunset, stick to the fried food.  Try: + Fried slipper lobster: Sweet tasty little nuggets.  Note: Slipper Lobster is not real lobster, but it tastes good.    + French Fries:  Drenched with tons of salty spices.  Just the way I like my fries.  Skip: - Crab Melt:  Nothing notable about this open-faced sandwich.  Would have rather gorged myself on french fries and saved $12.  - Oysters On The Half Shell:  Should have known better when I asked the waiter what type of oysters they had and he replied: ""Washington""  The oysters were very large and sweet.  Not the type of oysters you'd usually eat raw.  Leave these babies to grilling or frying.  Service:   The host was great, unfortunately his pleasant demeanor set us up for disappointment later on.  Our waiter was not Mr. Personality, nor Mr. Speedy by any means.  You'd think with the bird problem the staff would be on-top of clearing plates, au contraire!

While the rest of my party's food and the appetizers were phenomena (best pork chop I've ever tasted),they failed miserably at they ability to properly cook a steak.  As always, I ordered my filet medium-rare and you would think that was an easy task. Not so much here, I received a well steak. Things happen, but it's how you handle them when they occur. 20 minutes after taking my steak back and 5 minutes of me hovering the kitchen service area to find my steak, I received a rare steak which was good enough since everyone else had finished their meal.  When the bill was delivered and after observing the full cost of the steak on it, I inquired if any consideration would be given for the experience. Our waitress Sara said she didn't know, but would see if she could get us a desert. Sara returned delivered the split bill and left......no consideration made.  Wow.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 3.0
"I have been a big fan for awhile. Sat at the Chef's Table last night and had the September menu. Take-aways below.   -Service is excellent. Attentive, friendly, A+ hospitality  -Food is exciting and plentiful (I don't leave hungry and it's a great deal for $55/person). I noticed some concerning inconsistencies, though - and a few of the dishes seemed ""off"" in terms of flavor profiles.    1. Love the gruyere puffs, but ours were cold. Needed a little more time in the toaster.  2. 1st Plating portions were inconsistent depending on which of 2 chefs prepared it. My salad had 3 times the amount of pistachios, double the dressing, and much more salt than some of the others coming out. The Crudo was the worst I have ever had. Not refreshing, bland, warm... the only good part was the blood orange at the end to help erase the sweet potato puree taste.  3. Pasta courses I had: fettuccine and gnocchi. Rabbit in the fettuccine tasted like it was boiled in broth. Bland dish if it wasn't for the salty cheese and black pepper on top. As for the gnocchi - fantastic. Great flavors, savory, and fun twist with the blueberries. 4. Had the supplement for the Main dish - filet mignon. Mashed potato/oxtail side was solid. Filet mignon was good, didn't blow me away. The succotash had to have been made incorrectly. The amount of ginger in the dish made it inedible. Not acceptable to have a side dish come out like this at Sbraga.    5. Couldn't eat either of the desserts. Way too sweet. If you are a toddler or an adult with a HUGE sweet-tooth... than you'd have loved it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"From reviewing these reviews after the fact, I think they look a bit fluffy! Or perhaps because there really isn't any seafood or Mexican in the area accept for by Tampa Palms down the street with a seafood chain and another two Mexican places that are not good.  This place is a bit pricey as the first impression. The tuna ceviche that is served free with tostadas and tomatoes, cucumber, and salsa just tasted like amped up canned tuna. No biggie.  The horchata was quite watered down. The torta was quite small like really small and the chicken for the fajitas were a bit off and bland and a bit rubbery.

"Rachel truly is as good as it gets! Over the years, I've worked with a number of talented therapists and I'd say that Rachel takes the cake. Rachel is so present, observant and insightful. She is direct and uplifting and funny. She challenges with great care and explains larger concepts so that growth feels less personal and more an opportunity. Couples sessions with Rachel were the first sessions in which I didn't have to ""work."" Being in the field of holistic medicine and health, I've often had to feed or prompt or educate therapists along the way. Not so with Rachel. I could set down the emotional labor and be a true client. I felt seen, heard, cared for and supported. While my romantic relationship didn't work out, I am so much better for the investment we made in couples counseling with Rachel. I'm thriving again now, in part, to what she helped me to see in myself and in my former partner. I am so grateful to have learned and grown this past year with her help. I recommend Rachel to everyone and anyone. Rachel facilitates true transformation. If you are ready to do the ""work,"" you (and hopefully) your relationship will soar. It really is a tremendous opportunity to work with Rachel. Run, don't walk xo",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 5.0
"I have been a loyal customer of the barber for my monthly haircut for the last several years.  There recently has been a change in personnel. The new barber does not compare favorably to the one I have dealt with before.  She seemed nervous and inexperienced.  I can understand that.  But she was also sloppy and ignored important details.  The worst example is she never applied the shaving apron around my neck.  Instead she just placed it onto my chest.  After my haircut I had to go directly home to shower off the clippings.  Then, the new barber was less than meticulous in the cutting of my hair leaving noticeable differences from one side of my head to the other. She was nice enough, but needs to get much more experience.  She also must be more meticulous with the actual haircut.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 2.0

"This was our third dining experience at Brian's.  The appetizers were well prepared and were nicely seasoned. The monkfish entree with the tomato and ginger sauce was awful. The sauce was incompatible with the flavor of fish and the fish itself was dry. It seems that all of the entrees came with the same mashed potatoes and a pile of steamed veggies.  No presentation to speak of and definitely lacking flavor. worst part was, the waitress never got back to us to ask if everything was okay.  After dinner, she brought the bill with the coffee, but we hadn't had dessert yet. She blamed it on the number of couples dining that night ???  The pot de creme was delicious but the bananas foster wasn't as expected.  It had bits of French toast? chopped up and the entire dish was just too sweet.

All of us felt so unwelcome the moment we stepped foot in this place for lunch.  It didn't help that it reeked of pine-sol, which just reminds me of dirty bathrooms.   The waiter seemed tired or clueless or maybe he just didn't care.  My Dad even joked with him ""Are you awake yet?""  He wasn't familiar with the menu or the tequila drinks.  We are used to Tex Mex and unfamiliar with its differences with authentic Mexican cuisine.  He met each question with hostility -- no we don't have lettuce.  No we don't have chips and sauce, you have to pay for it.  Ok guy we get it, now can you tell us what vegetarian options you have?  No, I had to decipher the menu for him.

"We were there for a quick meal. We waited an hour after ordering to get our last appetizers. They served our chicken quesadilla without it properly prepared. No guacamole, sour cream, etc. 20 min. later the chicken strips arrived, they were good but imagine feeding everyone at different times. (Awkward.)  My steak taco literally made it an hour later, plus it was served completely plain. Was this a competition on how many ways you can mess up? WTH??? I had to go so I just bagged it.. After complaining they did not apologize, instead the manager only compensated for half the meal and looked like we were bothering HIM.  Look, I've been to 23 countries and I've never been served this badly EVER from a so called four star resort, not even from small village hotels. Heck, even a Street Vendor does better.

"In short: just don't. 2 stars is being generous. My family showed up at 10pm on a Saturday night and were surprised to see only three other tables there. [Side note: If a restaurant is dead on Saturday night- probably a red flag].   The beginning started off good. We were pleasantly surprised that they offered us a sling for our car seat carrier to be sat beside the table instead of having to struggle to put the car seat carrier on the booth or on a chair. We were promptly greeted by our server who offered us drinks and took away the touch screen ipad to order from. This was another plus in my book as maybe I'm ""old-school"" but I hate going to a restaurant and having the server tell me to just order from the screen. We ordered our food and waited. And waited. Annnnd waited.   Our server came back 15-20 minutes later and told us our food would be out shortly, another 10 minutes later the manager came and told us again it would be out soon and that they had a cook drop something so they needed to do a remake which is why it was taking so long. For the inconvenience she said she would take 25% off of our bill. At the time  I thought this was nice of her to offer that without us having to complain about the experience, but after the food we received I feel it should have been 50% at least. Whatever, accidents happen, but no ""bottomless"" fries in the meantime? We got our food- my sweet potato fries were cold and turning hard, and my son's ""4 cheese melt"" off of the adult menu literally had me appalled that they would serve something so bad. It was basically just a grilled cheese, was way too small for the price, was overly toasted to the point of not even being chewable by a child, nonetheless an adult.   After finishing one round of fries, I asked our server for more. He went to the kitchen to ask for more fries and the manager was back there and super loudly says ""it's going to take about 4 minutes, but this is the last round."" It was 10:50...10 minutes before closing, and 10 minutes after we had even gotten our food due to THEIR error. I've worked restaurants in the past- from fine dining to casual diners, and this was completely inappropriate in my opinion. To top off a horrendous experience, my son's plain fries refill came back with their spiced seasoning heavily on them- making them completely inedible for a 4-year old.

But I felt compelled to write a review about my experience at Midway tonight.  It was our first time here and it will be our last. The restaurant itself is nice, new, clean.  The staff was just fine.  However...to put it simply: the pizza is not very good. It's a poor attempt at deep dish and it misses the mark. When the main attraction is pizza, and the main attraction doesn't deliver (no pun intended, but made me smirk) , it means I won't be returning. I realize this place is favorably reviewed on the whole.  So to be fair, there must be people that enjoy their pizza to be very heavy (it's literally heavy) on the dough, and not so flavorful on the toppings.  When I first moved here last year, I did not expect to find good pizza (I'm from the northeast).  But, believe it or not, New Orleans has several options for VERY good pizza.

"Warning: My first experience was on Cinco de Mayo so the service may not have been normal. However, I am standing strong with 1 star because the food was the worst part of the whole experience, and I feel that should be consistent no matter the night.  We expected it be busy when we arrived, and the hostess informed us there was an hour wait for a table. Not in a rush to eat, we headed to the bar for margaritas. I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty and authentic they were (didn't taste like a mix although I believe they used one). My friend attempted to by the 2nd round, but gave up after waiting for 20 minutes. When we finally got our drinks, I was extremely disappointed that it tasted NOTHING like the first round. They re-made them for us but still it was still not that great.   After about 30 minutes the hostess called our name and sat us at a table. This may have been a mistake, since we waited forever for a waitress to arrive. Finally after a lot of frustration, we flagged someone down. She said she wasn't our waitress but would help us anyway. We ordered chips and roja, tacos, and a quesadillas. While the chips were great and tasted homemade, it was not enough to boost the review. At first glance the entrees looked tasty, but it was all a facade. The meat was so smokey it tasted like it had been marinated in cigarettes. And we ordered three different types of meat so it was obviously not a mistake. After a few bites, we lost our appetites and did not finish our food.  After waiving down the waitress a second time, we were finally able to order another round of drinks. She informed us she was really busy and had nine other tables to deal with.... not OK. The restaurant is pretty small with about 15 tables and 4 servers.... they should have been able to handle it.  I WILL NEVER, EVER COME BACK HERE",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"RUDE AND INCOMPETENT STAFF. They took our orders and our money, and completely lost our order. We sat for 30 minutes with no food on our table, with the staff looking at us sitting there with no food, whispering to each other, and no one came up to us to check on the fact that we were the only ones in the restaurant (there were only 18 people and we were a table of 3), that did not have food. It wasn't until I went up to the counter, that they bothered to check on our order and realized that THEY NEVER PUT IN OUR ORDER. They had to have us all walk up and reorder our food, they couldn't even bother to to walk to us at our table, and were ridiculously rude about this whole situation. No one apologized or took any responsibility for what happened. Eventually, even when we got our food, THEY STILL GOT OUR ORDER WRONG. Once again, they were rude and extremely patronizing throughout this whole interaction, while all we wanted was the food we paid for. The food was good, but not worth the disrespect to our money, our time, and our dignity. Will never ever return due to horrible service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I've gone to 1972 for my haircuts, and often leave looking (and feeling) like a dapper bad-ass.  Daniel's very friendly and approachable, a nice guy to make conversation with. He never does a rush-job; he'll be thorough and diligent, and has always made sure that I'm happy with my haircut. He also gives me good advice on how to comb and style my pompadour, what product I can use, etc.  The shop is relaxed and genuine, nothing snooty nor pretentious. I'd describe the atmosphere as ""your greaser friend's man-cave."" The place is clean and comfortable, with cool artwork/decor on the walls and a steady helping of punk/rockabilly music. Very welcoming.  So long as I'm in Tucson, no doubt I'll continue to go to 1972 for my haircuts.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 5.0
"While my stay here was brief it was memorable. It definitely has southern charm flair here. The aesthetics and ambiance of this place is unreal! Like straight out of some magazine.  I really need to sightsee next time I visit this hotel.   The concierge was superb. I had an early flight and I was tired. My bell guy was kind and helped me with luggage and gave me a quick 411 of the place.   Like it wasnt noon yet and all I wanted to was plop on the bed and nap. I have a major phobia of staying at hotels because of germs and cleaniness. Well rest assure here, they dont play!! No shortcuts in cleaning! The hotel smells like heaven. Like smelling BBW wallflowers to the 10th power. My mini bar was a dream come true! Man the things add up!!!   Ok before,  I ventured out I soaked in the tub and used the bath salts and bath soaps!! Im ready to ditch my Body Shop collection for this! Just when Im ready to grab my own towel from home my friend comments on how plush and soft the hotel towels were! Omg so soft and definitely of high quality.  Like this hotel really offers great amenities! Now, I had a lot to do in 3 days. I really wanted to chill in my room the entire time.  However they have freshly baked cookies in the lobby. Does it get any better?  The concierge checked on us to make sure we were good or needed anything. I love their turn down service.  Talk about living in the lap of luxury.   As a treat every night, my friend got me their banana pudding cheesecake.  It was delish. Words cannot describe. Im already missing Nashville.

"Let me explain something here before I get into the review of CiCi's on EastBay and 19.   I was here once before and had a bad experience. So the managers contacted me and offered to make it up by giving me vouchers to return. So I did with my girlfriend and our 2 kids. I went there yesterday.   The manager told me they are new management and have made renovations and really changed the place. So I decided to check it out and try it.   Everything was okay at first. When trying to find a table, I could not find a booth without huge gashes and holes in the seats. So not sure where the ""renovations"" were made since everything looked the same. The pizza itself was not bad, It actually tasted better than last time.   BUT now the day after my girlfriend and I are throwing up and have massive diarrhea. I mean liquid coming out of my butthole, just pouring out.   If you love clinging to the toilet, having uncontrollable bowel movements, bubbling in your stomach and puking your brains out then this CiCi's is for you!

Before I took my first bite, I noticed a hair on the nachos, which made me hesitant to eat the rest of the food. The refried beans on the nachos were so dry and the bulgogi meat was rubbery and hard to chew. The elote had flaming hot Cheetos seasoning, which ended up being very soggy and the corn was tasteless. After eating the food, I had a stomach pain that lasted for a few hours. The only reason why I gave this place 2 stars is because they were accommodating to others.

Instead, we got dinner entrees and it was a proportion well worth the price (personally I had trouble finishing my salmon because it was so big). The atmosphere of the restaurant was also quite lovely, something between the cross of modern and traditional. I love how the hostess, upon seeing that my younger siblings were with us, changed the soundtrack playing to Disney songs.

"I had been wanting to visit this place for years and finally was able to on a short trip this weekend. We went on Friday in the late morning in the hopes that it wouldn't be too crowded and it wasn't. I thoroughly enjoyed walking through the exhibits and viewing the various miniatures on display. And there is so much more than just miniature houses. The museum takes you through the history of miniatures and how they came about. You get to learn about the role they played throughout history and about the wonderful people who brought us them. There are other collections as well such as Kewpie dolls, Military figurines, Christmas houses, miniature dolls with heads made of a single grain of wheat, carvings made from the tip of a pencil, and so much more! There is a nice gift shop afterwards and if you become a member of the museum (which we did) you get 10% off your purchases. It really is a great deal! Unfortunately we didn't think to bring our own headphones so that we could listen to the self-guided tour and they do not have any to loan out anymore (I assume due to Covid) so we had to read everything ourselves. There is a lot to absorb and the next time we come I will be sure to pack our headphones and make sure our phone is fully charged. The entire visit took us 3 hours to go through and I took just over 500 photos while we were there. I can't wait to bring our granddaughter one day so she can see the treehouse with the faeries!

The rolls were not overly elaborate. The preparation added some texture and some spice without distracting me from the fish inside. The rice was not too cold or too warm and perfectly sticky.  The nigiri was amazing. The white tuna and salmon were, quite simply, the freshest I've ever eaten.

"I am so delighted to give my highest recommendation to A-1. They are in fact A M A Z I N G! I bought a lovely mobile home in San Vicente but it has needed renovations. One of the things I thought I might need to replace was the obviously original double wall electric oven by O'Keefe & Merritt in the kitchen. The door in the top oven was slightly askew, and three different people I asked (two contractors and one handyman) all said to just use the latch when I wanted to bake. I've been cooking for decades and I know the latch is used for self cleaning,, not baking. At this point frustration set in. I didn't know what to do because I wasn't sure if the oven was safe to use and I wasn't going to trust a non-expert's word on something that had to do with safety. After a couple of days of intense googling, I found A-1 here in Santa Barbara. I called. The vintage appliance repair's owner was courteous, knowledgeable, and came out this afternoon to look at it. He looked it over carefully, tweaked a few things, checked the various dials and temperatures, and said it was actually in perfect condition. The oven is from 1978, same as the home, and it has almost never been used. It is in fact close to brand new, the best he has ever seen. The door that wouldn't close was likely due to it being open and someone bumping or falling lightly against it. But that has been fixed, and I have essentially a new oven for $85! And I promised him I wouldn't get rid of it. Uncommunicative and/or unresponsive handymen (or, worse, those who tell you things they really don't know about) can be very discouraging. But then you come across someone like this who restores years' worth of faith in experience. Thank you!",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 5.0

"The tour guide is really nice, but gives too much detail about unnecessary things, he talks about things he points to, which 85% of the tour cannot see from where they're sitting, and rolls quickly past interesting things but stops at places where nothing happened.   Here's an example of a tour tidbit: ""If you went to De LaSalle, we know who you are. They made a lot of movies there."" Wait a minute, what does it mean about you if you go there? Which movies were shot there? Then we got to a neighborhood and he spat out Sandra Bullock, Lafayette Cemetery, and the Manning Brothers which all sounded interesting, but he drove past quickly and we couldn't tell what was what. I'd rather see a lot less and get to know more about those things than see hundreds of things and not know which building you're talking about or learn nothing about the place.  After we stopped for beignets, he kinda stopped hosting the tour so he could listen to the Jazz hour on the radio for 10 minutes. It was definitely a NOLA thing, but I paid to learn stuff, not to deal with quirky nothingness.   He points out lots of places to eat, but I don't know why. Is the food good there? Does something interesting happen there? Is it historical? Do they make a certain type of dish well there? Where in the world are we?  And even though it's not his fault, there's nothing like a little coach cough from a fellow passenger to strike terror in one's heart.

Ordered the pulled pork since I was a first timer. It was very tender and had good flavor. I liked that it wasn't shredded too much like some places do. I really appreciated the cherry chipotle BBQ sauce. It was pretty sweet but something different.  It also went well with the brussel sprouts.  As far as the sides go. I knew I was going to a BBQ joint and wasn't going to be eating super healthy, but I think the sprouts would have been better if they were roasted with just a little oil. They were instead deep fried meaning they were just covered in oil. I even had a few tablespoons of oil at the bottom of the box they were in. The fries were on the salty side. I did see someone next to me order a side salad and it looked pretty fantastic. It actually had dark leafy greens and veggies in it.  I like that they serve the meat with tortillas.

Its the exact same sandwich you'll get at the Little Nugget, same yummy bun, same excellent burger, same tasty and fresh veggies. Just excellent.   Like the original, it comes on a giant mountain of french fries. My only quibble (and why I gave 4 stars instead of 5) is that the fries, while piping hot, were a bit on the limp side. I like my fries to be somewhat crispy. But, I did get this as a takeout option, so the fries rode home with me (about 7 minutes) before being eaten, and like all awful awfuls, the burger is stacked on the fries, so I'm guessing that had something to do with it. Don't get me wrong, they were extremely tasty, just not crispy. Still, this is the best take out burger I think I've ever had. Excellent.   I really liked the little bar too. Its homey and cute.

I also got a Cyber Monday e-gift for making a purchase that day.   Being a Nordstrom customer has benefits and of course the more you spend the better they get. The Level 4 customers got treated to a private shopping party complete with wine and champagne. (Not me, I'm still working on Level 2 lol) But as someone who has been on both sides of this company I can honestly say customer service is priority number one and no one does it better.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 5.0
"Great selection of plants. The reduction in stars is for the abrasive customer service. We went in asking for cat-safe houseplants. The first employee who assisted us told us that if our cat died that we could just get another one! She then stated that we could not control if the cat died and that death was a natural part of the circle of life. This self-proclaimed nihilist stated that she is not a ""cat person"" and therefore has no knowledge of pet safe plants. Not sure that the logic flies. Thank goodness another employee jumped in as I would never return to this nursery had it been for the ""nihilist."" I like my plants but the customer service leaves much to be desired.",Business Category: Home & Garden,Review Stars: 3.0
"You are responsible for asking the server for what you want to drink. Be wary if you have a food allergy. Do not trust the servers to tell you which foods contain allergens. My waitress kept insisting my meal was free of eggs but when I got it, there was mayo on it. I was not refunded.  I recommend the miso salmon ($12 last I went). I do not recommend the black cod ($14) which had a measly sized piece of fish. It tasted almost as if it had been frozen because the texture of it was spongy. (Fish frozen for longer than supposed to often ends up with a slightly spongy texture when cooked.) I was very disappointed with this dish.

"Long time Starbucks customer. I easily spend $50 a week at various stores and I'm a coffee addict. As they rapidly expand their brand on to every corner in Florida though there's been a noticeable downgrade in customer service. This experience at the Fowler Starbucks was really the nail in the coffin for me and the brand.  I showed up to the location at 4:45 AM on my way out of town traveling for business. all the lights were on including the drive light. After sitting in the drive thru area for over 5 minutes with no response I drive up. Inside I can see two employees who see me but don't acknowledge me at all. I'm clearly there assuming they're open and they just go about their business ignoring me entirely, not even offering a wave or hand motion that they're closed.  And I certainly wasn't discreet lol. I honked, shouted, even tapped on the window. They probably didn't open till 5, but they could at least give me some indication of that. or make any effort at all to acknowledge me as a human standing there clearly wanting coffee and thinking they're open... So it's Wawa from here on out for me. it's been real Starbucks",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"You can't beat the location here.  You're in the heart of Rittenhouse Square with quick access to more bars and restaurants than you can possibly imagine.  You can tell that this is an older hotel yet the chipping paint and scuff marks actually do not detract from the experience.  If anything, the old feel increases the ""classiness."" It's a very charming hotel, clean and well-maintained with very friendly staff.  The exercise room is one of the better ones I've seen in a hotel although the equipment is slightly dated and the room is kept at an unbearably high temperature for working out.  The bathrooms/locker rooms here are nice with a cute little sauna.  The room was spacious and clean, but again had the older feel.  The bed was not uncomfortable but was not the most comfortable either - the sheets were a little stiff/over-starched.  No vent in the bathroom which I always find annoying in hotels because I hate toweling off in a steamed room.  What induces me to drop my rating to 3 stars is the overpriced parking.  $50/night for valet.  Don't bother - just park yourself in one of the numerous surrounding ramps for anywhere from $20-$30/night.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 3.0

I was very excited to order the new Dr Pepper style sauce, however, upon ordering ribs today, was told that they don't have ribs at this location. Major bummer. Someone in management seriously dropped the ball on this one. Couldn't they buy ribs from a store or borrow from another nearby Chili's? I know that there is one in Land O Lakes and also one the other direction in Zephyrhills.  Also, they have the little entertainment kiosks set up on all the tables. My 3 yr old daughter wanted to play it so I went through the menus and selected the $1 play option so that she could do some games while the rest of my family ate. However, the kiosk shut off after about 15 minutes of our 1 hr stay. Still was charged for it.   Several other food related issues as well. Worst Chili's experience ever.

The space is teeny and I can imagine it being great for dinner/drinks, but was a little dark for me for a weekend brunch. We sat at a great cushy bar table...I ordered coffee and my boy had a bloody mary. He loved his drink, but sadly my coffee came luke warm.   I ordered the 2 egg breakfast and he had the burger. Because the prices are so high even for my 2 eggs plus potatoes and toast, I was expecting great things. I was definitely let down though...my eggs were under cooked (edible, but not super enjoyable). He loved his burger, and the tater tots we shared were delicious. The dipping sauce was smoky and bacon-y and paired perfectly.

When the lady started soaking my fingers in acetone and using the nail sander to remove my existing nail color, I knew they were rushing to get customers out and not using proper techniques. When she started doing the actual manicure and pushing down my cuticle, she didn't use a cuticle softener (white gel thing) she proceeded to tell me ""they didn't use that here"". What?!?! This an essential part of the manicure. The final straw came when I asked her to cut the edge of my thumb that had dead skin.

"Wow what a hip spot for the Ballwin/Manchester area! Joey B's draws the crowds for its extensive menu, fun atmosphere, and trendy outdoor seating and bar area with bright folliage and tropical plants all around. Sort of made me feel like I was back home in LA!   We went on a Monday night around 7pm and the place was packed! We had to circle a few times around the parking lot to find a spot and eventually nabbed one after waiting for another car to leave.  The food is pretty standard with options ranging from salads, sandwiches and wraps, burgers, steak, and pizzas. The portions are very large! The salads are massive!! I got the Voo Doo Chicken Wrap, which was pretty tasty and came with a huge heap of fries. Meal prices range from around $10-$20. I noticed many families, and it seems like a fun place to bring kids.   Some of other reviews I saw criticize the service, which was the only part of our dining experience that left a little something to be desired. The staff members were frantically rushing about in all directions, which was a bit distracting in the beginning. We learned to get used to it as time went by. Glasses of water went without being refilled for several minutes. We were served an appetizer without any plates, which I had to ask for after some of us were eating off our napkins. This was not a big deal, but at least 5 staff members walked by without anyone noticing. These examples are very small and subtle, and also I think very forgivable at a bustling place with a jiving atmosphere. Many of the staff seem young and a bit inexperienced. Our waiter was super nice and personable, and continuously apologizing because it was only his third day.  Overall, this is a fun place to bring your family or some friends. The service isn't the best, but the food is good and will leave you feeling satisfied and likely wanting to come back again some time, if not just for the tropical vibes.

Tonight we went and it was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had, not only at Gianino's but throughout my dining existence. Being Father's day it was busy when we got there and we were prepared for the hour wait.   What we not prepared for was having to get our own menus after being seated with missing silverware and then waiting 20 min before my sister got up to ask the bartender if we could get some service.  The waiters were cleaning off table of people who left but would not give us the time of day.  The rest of the night, the nice bartender who took care of us did the best she could while tending to her customers.  Needless to say most of the time when we needed something we had to get up to ask her or get the attention of another waiter....  When we needed bread, butter, drinks, etc, they were EXTREMELY rude.  Rolling their eyes right in front of us and giving us attitude.  All we were wanting was service and in a service industry it seemed hard to come by.   Most of the food was cold when served and the steaks were cooked incorrectly.  Hard to get refills or drinks unless you got up yourself to get them.  I had to go to the bar and pay.

"Worst place ever to send your 3 years old, unless she is a super star. If your child is the kind of shy one (like mine) and because of that it is hard for her to participate, they will take her out of the room (even if your child is just ONLY sitting and watching the class, without being disruptive at all). Believe me, I have been a teacher myself for 25 years and I would be the first on taking my child out of the room is she were disruptive. They do not have any knowledge at all about child development. They expect 3 years old to behave like 6 years old, and that its too much pressure for a child. When I called to comp[lain about this issue, I was treated in a very bad way, and the man on the phone even told me that if I did not like it, I can open my own dance academy and create my own rules. At the end, they called me back to return the money for the days that were paid and that are not going to be used (telling me that was a courtesy and exception, that they never do that.

"The Casino:   The casino and all its public areas are kept clean.  The staff, in customary Harrah's fashion, is very friendly. The payouts seem fair.  The problem is the patrons and clientele in which the casino attracts.  During the week and day hours, it seems ok but in the evening and on the weekends, forget it.  The patrons, in large numbers are downright dirty and rude.  Women half dressed and guys and some gals with their pants hanging off them.  After 8 pm the thumping music from the C bar can be heard over the regular overhead music and I am not quite sure what purpose that serves other than being annoying.  You also have the C-Bar which boasts half naked women dancing on the bar...one step from away from being a stripper club.   The other big negative is the smoke that lingers throughout.  The non-smoking area is  up front and when it is not real busy, it seems fine. However, during peak hours it gets pretty bad.  A lot of the patrons do not even pay attention to the non- smoking areas and smoke any where they want and no one says anything to them or enforces the policy.    The Buffet:   Overpriced for what you get.  The food is mediocre.  The Chinese section usually has some good options and the rest is hit or miss.  The fried chicken is good if you catch it fresh and not dried out and the hand-carved stations fair pretty well also. In their attempt to go ""fresh"" they use fresh vegetables but on more than one occasion, we have found them nearly raw. (Manager actually went down the line and pulled them all one night).  The dessert options are pretty bad.  The biggest negative is that you have to go through the smoking section to get there and the stench is horrific.  Just the trip to and from will have you wreaking of cigarette smoke. In summary, I would NEVER pay actual money for this buffet and am reluctant to waste my TR Points either.  We only go with a free voucher.  The Cove: Pretty good meal, good staff, no negatives to report.  Caffe Napoli: This new Italian Eatery can best be described as INCONSISTENT.  Quality control is a definite issue here BUT when it is right, the food is good.  We have been there three times now and the order has yet to be totally right.  I paid $8 for a Caesar salad and the container was half empty.  The pizza was half cooked once but fine the next.  They consider 8 slices of pepperoni a topping.  The system by which orders are placed is HORRIBLE.  The whole dining process could EASILY exceed an hour during dinner.  You may stand in line for 30 minutes just waiting to order and then another 30 for them to bring it to you.  They really need to reevaluate their setup here.  Perhaps a take-out line might help or even a touch screen ordering system for people using comps.     Overall: I am a Diamond Member and patronize Harrah's properties all over and this, by far is the worst.  I only live a few minutes away and still patronize Atlantic City more frequently because of the riff-raff here.

If you want to charge $10 for a burger with no extras or sides, then it better be an amazing burger. This was not. No one in my group was impressed. The root beer tasted like water with root beer flavoring added. The total bill for three sandwiches, a side of mac and cheese to share, a root beer, soft drink and water was well over $50. I've had better food from a grocery store freezer section. We won't be returning.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I am going 'All In' on Eldorado as my favorite place to stay and play in Reno!  While we weren't able to get a room there on this trip, due to some unruly Boise State Fans who booked before us, we always stay here in one of the suites.  The rooms are large, clean, and smoke free!  As far as gambling, playing Craps at Eldorado is fun, whether winning or losing.  The dealers at these tables are friendly, funny, and quite entertaining and at the same time remember who is who, by name, and passing out those pretty green chips.  On this trip Doug was working our table and we had a great time.  They remember what you are playing, what your usual bets are and remind you to pick up your winnings so you don't lose it if that dreaded seven appears.    Sad to say they never handed me a Barney or Pumpkin Chip on this trip!  Maybe next time.....",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 5.0
"The best Italian food that we have enjoyed in the city.  The service was great and the space is very inviting.  Drinks were excellent, the negroni was refreshing.  We started off with the grilled octopus appetizer, the octopus was cooked to perfection, so tender and tasty.  The pasta dishes were al dente and delightful.  The gramigna was solid, didn't blow me away.  But the sauce on the agnolotti was to die for, I could have licked the plate, it was so savory and delicious.  The secondi were decent sized portions.  The baked halibut was moist and satisfying.  And the braised beef short ribs were amazing.  We look forward to our next visit!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"This location needs more training in customer service. After trying to call and voicemails going unreturned, I went to the location in person to try to work out delivery times around my work schedule. The first thing I was told was that I was not allowed to come in person due to the type of meds necessary; everything needed to be done by phone. I have used the Scottsdale location for almost 2 years with no issues and there were no silly rules like that there, so why would I know that at a different location? Apparently they do not count the day you start taking your medication as a day of the supply, so it is calculated however they decide it should be. The first lady who rudely greeted me ended up handing me over to someone else, while loudly stating that ""maybe they could explain it again since I wasn't understanding her explanation."" Well perhaps if everyone could count to 26 out of 28 PROPERLY without skipping day 1. This caused everyone in the room to turn and stare at me. A kind young lady named Lisa is the only one who treated me with respect. I asked her if we could speak privately so I could explain the situation; there is no private consultation area, so she offered to step right outside the door. Until the manager told her she wasn't allowed to. So I was forced to have everyone in the room hearing everything, while the manager continued to look at me like I was a problem. Lisa tried to help me, but the manager wanted to play ""God."" I have never been treated so poorly in my life over my medications. Wow.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 1.0
"The hotel boasts a newly completed renovation. I think it should be called a face lift. The hotel is very centrally located to all the places someone visiting Philadelphia would want to go. The lobby is very nice. The rooms are large. The decor and electronics were new. However the paint on the balcony was peeling. The shower handle came off in my husband's hand. Room service would miss things like replacing  liners in the trash cans throughout the room. The Public Address system was scary to listen to. And the ventilation system that ran by our room rattled all night long. There was a lot of food for breakfast, but the Best Western we had stayed in the night before had basically the same menu with higher quality product.

Terrible Motel!!! Also known as Budget Host Inn. My wife and I stayed there one night and I have never had a worse hotel experience. The front desk agent was horrible and couldn't correct a simple booking date problem. As a result of his incompetence I was double charged for our one night stay. The hotel room smelled awful. The floor was dirty. The mattress was uncomfortable. The towels were dingy. We will never stay in that roach infested pigsty of a motel ever again. I can't warn you enough... book somewhere else!

"Artistic Nails has a number of locations. I've been to the Mesa and the Paseo Nuevo locations.  I've been a long time consumer of manicures, pedicures, and acrylics, so I think that I can give a fair comparison.  Artistic Nails is slightly more upscale than the typical Vietnamese discount nail place, in my opinion. All locations have nice spa chairs, are pretty clean, and the employees have decent English. I've been to Artistic Nails dozens of times.  Paseo Nuevo: I think that this is where the chain puts its better people, as I'd consider the workers at this location among the better people (for this level of place). Being located in a busy mall, there are almost always 5-8 people working, which means that you're going to wait for less time. They are fast, which is a perk if you're trying to get out in time. If it isn't very busy, they'll put a second person on you to do your manicure.  Mesa: The chain puts crappier/newer people at this location. Time and time again I've been dissatisfied here. The people working there are always different (which makes me think that the new employees are put here to ""train"".) There are usually only 3 people working, even on weekends. This is fine when there is no one else around, as you can usually pop in without a wait. But it is really tough if there is a backup. As far as the quality of the service, I often get cut here. They are also slower than other locations (which can be good or bad). English language skills are noticeably worse at this location. I keep going back though because it is close to my house and I don't have to pay for parking (or drive).   One big perk of Artistic Nails, though - a student ID gets 10%.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 3.0

"This bakery was a cute place I discovered thanks to a friend's recommendation. I tried the green tea crepe cake (There was also a green tea pandan version) and it was amazinggg, with the perfect amount of fluffiness, and exquisitely thin layers. Will definitely be coming back to try other flavors! To my delight, they have so much more than just baked goods though!  The two food orders I got were the Sichuan hot and spicy dumpling soup and the pork soup dumplings. The Sichuan hot and spicy dumpling soup had a great Sichuan mala flavor, with a numbing spiciness. However, instead of naming it a soup (as the spicy sauce the wonton-style dumplings were in was not quite drinkable), maybe just spicy dumplings would be more accurate. The pork soup dumplings were delicious, although one or two of them had thicker skins than I'm used to. All in all, a very delicious and filling meal. I'll definitely be back!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

They redid my order, but it too awhile and ..well, i really wanted my food ASAP.  The coffee creamer (half and half) was already on the table with 1/2 veg oil butter and some jams.  I needed non-dairy alternative that was also gluten-free... no luck.  my friend wanted alternative sweeteners, but they didn't seem to have much.  The orders for toast went to the wrong people.. and everything was just kind of like.. a carefree environment more than.. business.

There was such great flavor, and the cheese, and soggy crouton were delicious.  Second course was a pike filled dumpling type dish.  I don't recall the french name.  It was light and airy, and topped with a tasty crawfish brown butter sauce.  Next was a veal stew.  It was great.  Finally, a walnut tart.

Both the almond & the raspberry croissants were calling to me, but I eventually chose the former as it looked larger. They offer some traditional freshly cooked breakfast items as well, in case you're not in the mood for sweets; I got two scrambled eggs for protein, and since almond milk was an option, an iced latte.  The croissant was everything a croissant should be--flaky and tender which a delightfully moist almond filling.

I went back a few days later, and am so glad I did. Though she still could not see well, (I found out she had had eye surgery), she escorted me around the store to the things I was asking about.

It is a great location, close to airport and just off the interstate for easy access. Also in great proximity to many restaurants and shops.  We arrived around 3:45 and were able to immediately check in. Unfortunately, our request to split the payment must not happen often. It took forever to process and when we checked out the following day, it had not been done properly. I was little put off by the guest services supervisor when I requested a receipt to see what exactly had been charged and was flatly told ""it will be placed underneath your door"".  I had to confirm the rate (which should have been done prior to him taking the card in my opinion). So of course, the following morning - the receipt was not underneath my door. When checking out the next morning, it was evident to the new front desk worker that payment wasn't done properly. He was nice and figured everything out.  There is a $6 parking fee, which I suppose isn't too bad, but a little annoying as it is on the outskirts of New Orleans and not the dead center. It would be nice if that was waived for Hilton Honors members.  I was happy to receive the complimentary bottle of water in my room and access to free fruit at the front desk.

And they were SUPER nice about accepting the sandy car--told us just to leave all the trash and not bother even putting it in the nearby bin!",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 5.0
"Looking to satiate a carving for carrot cake, I entered the night kitchen cafe and bakery. It's a very small and cosy space with a row of glass cases which contain adorable cakes and desserts.  I got a slice of carrot cake with a cappuccino and took a seat near the register. The cappuccino was milky and perfect. Its the best I've had in Philadelphia. The cake wasn't mind blowing but a great version of traditional carrot cake.  The super stars here are the ingredients. You can taste the quality and freshness of them! They use local milk in their cappuccinos! I left feeling warm and bubbly, the feeling you get when you eat good natural food.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 5.0

"I don't know what to say, this was my first time ever going to a Dave & Busters anywhere, and I have to say that is was pretty nice. I have a large family and we decided to take the girls there because they have had good grades in school. YAY!!! Anyway, arrived around 4:30 pm and we were seated right away. Our server was Imani and he was very helpful and sweet. We ordered Adult drinks for my husband and myself and drinks for the kids. After that we took time to look over our menu, I am sad to say that the kids menu is limited and not really that impressive but we made due with what we ordered in appetizers. The mountain of nachos was a little disappointing because it was mostly a mountain of chips with meat, beans and cheese put on the very top. I thought it was going to be more like an even thing all around the chips so that most of them would have something on it, but alas it was not. My pasta dish wasn't as thick as I believed it would be but the salmon was great. We did not play pool or go bowling but we did spend the last two hours playing games in the game room. The kids loved it. Their father and I even played a few games and the prizes were better then those at Chucky cheese's. We left before the night crowd came it. D&B's was differently something to experience. We did not have a trouble time like I have read in some of the reviews maybe it depends on the time you come in and how long you stay.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

For some reason during my wife's session, Isabella kept ranting about progressive liberals like AOC destroying air travel and how the Me Too movement was overblown. She literally told my wife that women need to just kick men in the shins to avoid harassment. She also tried to sell her friends book to her and her three friends.

"Here with a couple of girlfriends, a place I would never have chosen but glad they did, I just liked it the minute I walked in, an upscale saloon with a stage at one end.  The food surprised me, we shared plates and it was all good - hot livers and gizzards on white bread, sprout hash and a shrimp dish, enough.  The cocktails were tasty.  The mood relaxed.  I felt the waitress was a little over friendly, honestly I am just not that interested in listening to them witter on about themselves especially when there is food to be eaten but that's just intolerant ole me.  I really enjoyed my experience here.  We hit the bar downstairs afterwards for another cocktail.  It is large with sofas and more of a loungy feel.   They think it is speakeasy but seriously the music is so loud that is is anything but that.  There were very few people down there and after asking for it to be turned down we were finally driven out - just the totally wrong style of music for 8.00pm .  Price point was very affordable for upstairs and downstairs.  All in all a really nice surprise.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0

Like I mentioned above the food was mostly excellent, but it was expensive. I wouldn't recommend it for dinner, unless it's just 2 people who like to yell at each other and spend lots of money.

"Stayed here for two nights. Had a king room with a suite that they upgraded us to for free when we checked in that was nice.  The only complaint is the pull out couches were new and so it was tough to pull out into the bed. We couldn't get one fully open so gave up and then couldn't get it back in. We tried to tell cleaning staff but they didn't understand what we said so the next morning they just left us sheets for it and didn't put back when they came to clean the next day. I played with it and finally was able to get it pushed back in. Since they upgraded us to the suite, the extra room had a pull out couch so my son slept on that one instead. So it ended up working out. Just  a little bit of a mess until I was able to get the other one put back and we couldn't put the other one back either, so that ended up staying out the whole weekend. Staff was super friendly. Hotel was clean and I think our room had just been remodeled, so it was nice.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 4.0

"Over Hyped and over priced  Solely based on a recommendation from our hotel front desk, we decided to try this place for a New Orleans local cuisine. Evidently, all the surrounding hotels have the same recommendation because this place was packed with visitors. After being reassured by people exiting the restaurant that ""it is worth the wait"", I put my name on the list and was told it was going to be about 1 hour.   Well, being only one block from Bourbon street, figured I could keep myself entertained while I wait. Returned an hour later and was told that it would be about 10-15 minutes. So, 1 & 1/2 hour later....finally got a table. But, it's worth the wait, right?   WRONG  Started with the crab remoulade and shrimp/okra jumbalaya. No complaints here. The jumbalaya had a little spicy kick to it and really felt like a true traditional cuisine. Also, our server was very polite and prompt.   The major downfall was the main dish. For an indecisive couple on a budget, the 27$ half sampler dish seemed like a good idea. Portion size was big enough to share with 3-4 people, but I wouldn't recommend it being shared between 2 people for a dinner. Shrimp, fish, crab meat, and oysters...all deep fried and similar flavor. If it wasn't for the cocktail sauce, tartar, ketchup, hot sauce, and left over remoulade; this pile of flavorless deep fried seafood would have remained a pile. Trust me, I have had better less expensive  fried sea food in a boardwalk shack.   Keep in mind, this is based on one meal. But first impressions are everything.   In my opinion, the better way to enjoy the traditional food is with a beer in one hand and beads around your neck walking down Bourbon, stopping into the local food shops. No waiting, more drinking! Now that's worth it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Mai Lee is good. Over the top delicious? Meh, that might be pushing it. However, I am a fan, and when I stop in, I can appreciate the food.  It states that it is a mix of Chinese and Vietnamese. I typically go Vietnamese when ordering from here. I'm all about their vermicelli bowls, and Mai Lee does for sure have some of the best vermicelli I've ever tasted outside of the South Grand district.  The varying price range can honestly reach out to anyone one a budget. You can get items for as little as $6.95 for an entree up to over $10 or $11. With so many items on the menu, even the pickiest eater can find something to their liking. I like this aspect, especially since I'm not huge on venturing out of my comfort zone with some Asian food dishes. Some things I can do, some things I can't.  This most recent visit, the place was pretty packed. We nabbed 2 bar spots and immediately sat down. Our bartender got our orders, and the food was out pretty immediately. The only downfall of sitting at the bar is you don't get really the more personal touch versus having a typical server. You can noticeably tell the bartenders feel a bit overwhelmed with having to create drinks for the rest of the house on top of dealing with the bar patrons, and their food orders. They've also have to tend to to-go orders. I know I could not juggle all of that responsibility, but they do it with grace. Kudos to them!  Mai Lee is fun. I enjoy coming here when I'm in the Brentwood area, and I think it has a good, lasting reputation that remains consistent with their service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"First off, I've been to the old location on Calle Real last year with a friend, and I ordered the same exact thing that I did today - the tonkotsu ramen. At the old location, the ramen was way too salty for a person having lived in the 626 for most of their life, and so I thought the place was just okay. I tried their beef curry at the old location as well and it was just OK. At the time, I didn't think I would come back because the food was just average. However, when my friend mentioned she wanted ramen/udon today, I went along with it.  As we arrived at the new location, the place was nicely decorated and it was a lot bigger. We walked in at around 1pm and there weren't a lot of people. The service was good - we ordered within a few minutes of sitting down and were served with water promptly. When my tonkotsu ramen came and my friend's miso udon, I noticed the portions seemed bigger. My ramen came with a lot of condiments and there were a lot of noodles. As I started eating, the soup was not as salty as the old location and the taste was definitely a whole lot better.   So, I really think the new location has improved. I'm definitely coming back here again to try their beef curry and sushi! :)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I stayed here last night, got in late and left early this morning. Check in was quick and easy even without a reservation. The room was clean and large. You get an entire seperate living room. Bathroom was very nice and looked newly remodeled with a shower that had glass seperation instead of shower curtains which just makes the bathroom feel larger and cleaner. The flooring they use in the showers is also a nice touch because it has this texture that keeps you from slipping but is also attractive looking.  Dislikes:  - slow elevator - walls are thin- At 1am, I could hear the person in the room next door coughing and running the water- it sounded like it was in our hotel room. - they charge $7/ day for parking- I know that this is near the airport and the airport charges for parking but I don't think they should be charging hotel guests every time they pull in and out of a regular old hotel parking lot- it isn't in center city and it is just a small lot with no garage and we are already paying $20/ night.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 3.0

"I feel badly for all of the people who tried a hoagie from here and enjoyed it. Life is better out there and so are hoagies from pretty much anywhere else. We were very excited when this shop opened and more so when we finally got hoagies and got home to eat. The hoagies were nearly inedible.  To start with, the rolls, despite what others are saying, are nothing special. They might be Amorosos, which are Rolls 101, a sign that someone doesn't know what he's doing. Bland, low-grade, and invisible. No chew, no seeds, no flavor. Not Sarcone's for sure.  The veggies such as the lettuce, peppers, onions, and tomatoes were sliced paper-thin, to the point where there was no remaining texture, and were so sparse they looked like accidental leftovers from another hoagie.  The cheese was vastly too thin as well and inconsequential as a result. May as well not have been there at all. Maybe it wasn't.  So...on to the bad part of this review. We had turkey, Italian, and turkey/roast beef hoagies. The meats, like the veggies, were also cut paper-thin. The result was meat-mush, without texture and wholly disgusting. I finished my turkey hoagie because I was hungry. I did not enjoy it at all. My dining partners were unable to eat much of theirs, they were so grossed out. If you're missing a lot of teeth, these hoagies are for you.  I can see that these attributes were decided on intentionally in an effort to make something right. But when all of the decisions are wrong, there's no way the result will be right.  I am not happy writing this review. I wanted to have a premium place to get awesome hoagies. Mister Rick's, sadly, is not that place. Wawa hoagies are far better, and that's not saying much.  Update: I just saw the photos of hoagies at the top of the page. I wonder where they got those?

"My husband and I were looking to purchase a new Tempur-Pedic mattress directly from the manufacturer. However we always like to support local businesses, so we were excited to visit Relax The Back to make our purchase.   Our only firm buying criteria was that we needed the bed to be delivered within a certain timeframe. We were moving to a new home and needed the new bed delivered by the time we moved in. My husband was also having surgery the following week, so we expressed how important it was to have the bed delivered by a certain date for his recovery. Our salesperson was confident the bed would be delivered within the timeframe we needed, so we proceeded to make the purchase. Relax The Back also had a promotion going on that gave us a $200 gift card to their store with our purchase. We were told that the gift card would be mailed to us and would arrive before our mattress was delivered. We walked out of the store as happy customers anxiously awaiting our new mattress to be delivered.   Fast forward to the day of anticipated delivery. We are informed by our salesperson via phone that the mattress hasn't arrived yet, and that it won't be delivered by our move-in date. At this point we had already gotten rid of our old bed (since we were promised our new one would be delivered), so without the delivery of our new bed we were left without a bed to sleep in.   We were told by Relax The Back that the bed would deliver to their store the following day but since it was a Saturday they couldn't deliver the bed to us until Monday. After explaining we have no bed to sleep on and insisting the bed be delivered sooner, they finally agree to do a ""special delivery"" and deliver the bed over the weekend. At that point the person we spoke to over the phone also committed to speaking with the owners of the store about compensating us in addition to the $200 gift card due to the large inconvenience that this transaction has been to us.   The bed was delivered the following day. When inquiring with the delivery crew about the $200 gift card, we are told that it was put in the mail and we should receive it ""soon"". 7 days pass, no gift card arrives. We call Relax The Back to inquire with the salesperson who sold us the bed. Come to find out he doesn't work there anymore. How convenient. The person who answered the phone tells us he will ask the owners about the gift card and call us back. We never receive a call back. We call back two days later to inquire again about the gift card and we are then told again that the gift card is in the mail and we should receive it ""soon"". When also inquiring about the additional compensation we are told ""oh I thought the owners already spoke to you about that"". Um, no. We haven't spoken to anyone because no one calls us back!! We have yet to receive the gift card.   The service at this location has been TERRIBLE. Empty promises and lack of communication has made this experience horrific. We were very clear about what our purchasing criteria was before making our purchase. If the criteria couldn't be met, we would have rather had the salesperson be honest with us instead of over promising on what they couldn't deliver on. Typical sleazy sales situation, over promised to get the sale and commission and then when things go wrong no one is there to help. I recommend you go elsewhere for your mattress needs. This business obviously only cares about the sale and not the customer.",Business Category: Home & Garden,Review Stars: 1.0

"I would have giving a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the terrible service. If your not a regular there don't expect to be treated well. We had to go to the bar to get our first drinks, never given any side plates for our appetizer of wings we ended up eating  over our napkins! Also no handy wipes! Had to ask 2 times then no silverware! Husband went in to get some when the bar tender was too busy on his cell and the manager looking man just watched him talk he decided to just grab some off a near by table! If that wasn't enough I had  to ask for our check 3 times all the while my husband urging me to just get up and leave.  As far as the food goes it was very good,even though it was a very small & I mean small menu due to it was Mother's Day. Also I know what you may be thinking it was packed! Nope! Not!at! All!!

"Terrible service brother (in voice of Hulk Hogan). We waited for our server all night! I have worked in restaurants for a long time and I'm extremely understanding when it appears that a server is in the weeds and can't get to my table, but this guy was checked out and almost bitter (like he wanted to tear his shirt right down the middle in an act of pure rage...second Hulk Hogan reference, thank you).  When our mojitos arrived they were pretty much nonalcoholic, which might meet the dietary restrictions of a very popular pro wrestler but do not meet the ""drunk""etary requirements of MY diet.   As for the food, the coconut shrimp are actually pretty tasty as are the conch fritters. The volcano roll was ""meh"" but the fianc√© seemed to enjoy the mussels.  A friend's burger was ordered medium and arrived charred beyond sulfuric hell fire (sans the drama, it was extremely overcooked).   In summation - Crappy service, lame drinks (unless you're trying to adequately hydrate in preparation for the forced consumption of a dry, burned burger), and somewhat edible food.   In a last-minute, half-assed attempt not to sound like a total bitch, the view was very nice.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

The pool/Jacuzzi is nice and the grounds are attractive and well kept.  The free wi-fi worked everywhere I went on the property.  The only minor complaint is noise from the freeway that can be heard in the rooms near the front of the hotel.  Again, this is a minor issue and some may not even notice it.

I'm not usually a talker, so it was nice that he didn't pressure me into having a conversation. The owner came over and told me about the products as well, that they are different from other salons because of the quality of their products. I appreciate knowing what I'm actually paying for!

"So not impressed.  A friend and I stayed here the night before the Indianapolis Monumental Marathon. She sprung for a suite, which was quite large, but obviously needed work.  The carpet was peeling up in the main room thanks to water damage, and there was green mildew or mold growing in the bathroom. It was also freezing in our room, despite turning up the thermostat.  The vents also might as well have been intercoms to the room above us.  We heard the rowdy bunch word for word, and eventually smelled their cigarettes, too.  I called down to the front desk and they took care of it, until the behavior picked back up at 3 a.m.  Perfect for a pre-marathon slumber party.  It does get more than one star simply because the breakfast in the morning hit the spot for a solid meal before running for several hours. Also, the manager took pity on us and let us use the gym facilities to get ready before we left town after the marathon.

I wanted to try something new, and we just happened to stumble upon a 'Brunch 10-2' sidewalk sign in Broad Ripple.   We made our way upstairs and asked to be seated outside to enjoy what may be the last beautiful day in November. Our server quickly wiped our tables down, stating she didn't think anyone would sit outside, and mentioned their mimosa and bloody mary specials. They also have a nice beer selection to choose from with $5 pints.   We made our drink choices and bee lined to the buffet, where a chef was preparing an omelet to order. The variety of options is quite nice, with fresh fruit, yogurt and a variety of toppings including granola. Beside that was a choice of two salads before you got to the hot trays filled with bacon, sausage and cheese scrambled eggs. There was a carving station with roast beef and meatloaf next to another warmer full of biscuits & gravy, mac & cheese and green beans. There were also two choices of salads, and, as if that weren't enough, there was an entire table of sweet breads, cookies, chocolate drizzeled funnel cakes and bread pudding. Can you say food coma??  As we made it back to our seats, our drinks and water were waiting. I dug in, but noticed that there was no salt/pepper/ketchup around and my brunch needed some seasoning.

They close the lobby at 10 and the drive thru at 11pm. We ordered an 8 piece all white of mild chicken. They, as usual, were all out of mild chicken. We agreed to wait 15 minutes for new chicken and went to sit.  I watched as most of the employees screwed around talking while some were treating down/cleaning like they were getting ready to close. After waiting nearly 10 minutes,  I went up the the counter to check on our order,  only to over hear that they had not dropped the chicken we were waiting for. Now livid, I demanded my money back and the names of the employees since most if not all were doing little to no work.  One of the employees supposedly named ""Dennis"" came from the back and started getting belligerent with me and very animated like he wanted to jump the counter and hit me.

I did peruse the rest of the store and most normal product prices were inflated above Kroger's.  So I guess if you know what you're shopping for they may or may not have a better price.

"What a great addition to the NoLib/Fishtown food scene. For all you pho and beefy goodness lovers out there, this is where it's at. I literally just ate the pho here for the first time and I thought it was delicious!  The beef soup ($9) was flavorful, hearty, and simply yummy. I was slurping every last bit towards the end. I have no shame when it comes to good food. And unlike many pho places, the meats are extremely tender and wonderfully seasoned. For my fellow vegetarians, even the tofu in the mushroom pho melt in your mouth. Don't expect gigantic bowls because the mantra here is quality trumps quantity. I can see myself ordering two bowls one day though...just saying. But do order a glass of delicious authentic Vietnamese iced coffee ($3) along with your pho and you'll be in love.  For being only opened less than a week, service was excellent. Everyone were friendly and accommodating. First time in my life I've eaten pho as I sat on a counter watching it being cooked right in front of my eyes. The passion, love, and care I saw in making the bowl of pho was just amazing. As If I was sitting on a small stool in the streets of Saigon but only in lot nicer setting (you know what I'm talking about if you've been to Vietnam). And for a small business (20 seats), they do accept cards. It's also BYOB so bring your beverages of choice.   I genuinely recommend trying out Stock if you're a fan of pho. However, If you've been eating pho probably before you could even speak like me, try to come here with an open mind. For there are slight modern interpretations of the common pho recipe. Everyone can agree Vietnamese food is awesome and because of that reason, talented chefs are taking notice. So it makes sense how Stock came about.

"Wound up here at the height of March Madness madness, unfortunately. Sports bars so aren't my scene and idgaf about basketball beyond the NBA. My mom won a couple of gift cards and passed them on to me. This was a couple of years ago but that's okay. Gift cards don't expire.  We plugged our ears and put in our initial order: mac 'n cheese and chicken fingers to start, plus my friend chose a drink that I can't recall. The supposedly legendary mac didn't live up to the hype and didn't match the pics posted here. It was like Stouffer's put on a rented tux and threw itself into a ramekin dish. I grew up on Stouffer's, so I wasn't mad about it, but I did expect more. The chicken fingers were decent but the honey mustard dipping sauce assaulted my sinuses. I found when used judiciously that it was a great decongestant though, so again, not mad.  The empanadas and sliders were a bit more problematic. The cheesesteak inside the empanadas was downright nasty in taste and texture, with a flavor like old shoe leather. The sliders were literally raw inside and arrived to the table mooing. They remerged ten minutes later as hockey pucks on buns. We ultimately avoided eating them. The accompanying fries were delicious. We ate them all.  Angela, our waitress, was fabulous and delightful all around. She did her best, considering the circumstances of the situation, and I applaud anyone who has what it takes to thrive at a place like this, really I do.

"I've been going to Layla's for years because they're affordable and had great customer service. Every year I take advantage of their free birthday threading. It's a really great deal and all they ask is for identification ( ID or passport).   When I walked inside there was about four ladies one was already attending a customer and the other three were huddled up talking. I was greeted and the woman that attended me had red acrylics, rings on her fingers, full face of makeup pretty woman but gave me horrible customer service. When I sat on her chair I didn't expect for my head to go way back.. it was uncomfortable for my neck and back. When she was doing my eyebrows I was taken back on how hard she was moving my face also re adjusting my fingers. It's part of their job to move your face so they can get a better view also re adjust your fingers so they can get the bottom hairs of your eyebrows, but instead of being gentle she was rough towards me. When she finished she gave me a napkin and a mirror to check my eyebrows, Layla's employee's always ask if they can apply aloe Vera or water to help heel the redness around the eyebrows. I have sensitive skin so I always say no to the aloe and water. Once I put the mirror down to let her know the eyebrows were fine she put a cotton ball with I don't know what and ran it across my eyebrows. I was shocked because I did not ask her to do that. She walked away and was heading to the register. I went to the seating area where my boyfriend had my backpack so I can show her my ID and get my free birthday threading. Unfortunately I could not find it and I asked her if there was any way I can confirm it was my birthday that day. She asked if I had a Facebook and I said no. I told her I have an email from Sephora about my birthday gifts. She said no if I don't have a Facebook there no other way to confirm it. She didn't give me a chance to show her my birthday emails.

First time trying this place and we will definitely be back. I ordered the sweet and spicy dog which aptly lives up to its name with a good blend of sweet from the raspberry and bbq sauces with spicy from the jalapenos muted a bit by the cheese sauce. The fries are fresh hand cut with a bit of seasoning on them and were very tasty as well. With 17 different dogs and 8 different dressed up frys to order off the menu I am going to guess you really can't go wrong here.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

This is Christmas done right. The lights are beautiful and spread around the whole park. Christmas music classics playing all around to. You can not help but bounce around with Christmas joy. They do a light show every 15 minutes on the colony house and it is awesome.  They only complaint I would have is that the colony house restaurant should be open on a Friday evening and they should stay open a little longer than 8. But now that you don't have to pay extra for it you can't complain to much because it is an amazing display of lights.,Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 5.0
"Stopped by for a bite while in the area. It's been awhile since my other half have been to Red Robin . This location seems new-ish and is brightly lit and clean. We were seated quickly and checked out the menu. I went with the Tavern burger with veg patty and my guy went Clam Chowder. He loves the chowder here. The food came quickly and we were happy because of hunger. I enjoyed my burger but him? Nope. He didn't find any clams in the Clam Chowder and was disappointed . He ate it  though due to his empty belly. Our server was friendly and made sure our drinks were filled without asking. Overall, we might return.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Thanks to many others, the hype in my head I had for Mimi Blue was at an all time high. Thinking I might be let down, I trekked here for lunch with a coworker. It's safe to say, Mimi Blue lived up to the hype.  The inside was cute and cozy and not really how I had pictured it, but that's not bad in this case.  Our server was friendly and great at explaining the menu. We were a little confused at how ordering worked - but once we figured out that you mark your choices on the menu with the markers on the table, we were in business.  I went with the 4 Baller, as I wanted to try as many meatballs and sauces as possible in my short time here. I don't remember all of the combinations I got, but I can recommend the Turkey meatball with garlic cream sauce. Fantastic! Also really liked the spicy cilantro sauce. I actually could have done without the veggie meatball and probably wouldn't order that again.   I thought 4 meatballs might be too much, and maybe I was hungry, but it was actually the perfect amount. I left satisfied and full, but not stuffed.   All of the sides sounded fantastic as well and I'll definitely be back to the mac & queso and fried brussel sprouts.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

We had heard from friends that recently the food quality was spotty but we decided to give it a try.  Our friends were right.  The restaurant setting is as handsome and quaint as it gets, hidden in a garden away from tne hustle-bustle of town.  We were promptly seated at a table where the fresh air wafted through an open window.  Our server soon arrived to chill our wine and fill our glasses to our liking.  She was friendly yet professional throughout the evening.  To be kind , the food was most ordinary. The oysters were fresh and briny, but the tiniest we have ever experienced. The Delmonico steak was chewey and too saucy  to enjoy any meat flavor it might have had.  The rack of lamb ordered medium rare came out medium.  While it was handsomely presented it lacked any flavor.

The server at the counter didn't attempt to make any conversation throughout the tasting though and didn't tell us which wine we were sampling which seemed quite off to me.

I know PT is not where people want to be, but the PT/PTA's there are passionate about what they do and are there to help and provide guidance in anyway they can.

"3.5 stars for the price. Rounding up to 4 since we did have a lovely three night family stay overall. A few details:  1br suite worked great for our family of 5; nice big master br and kids had room for pullout couch plus trundle.  Beach is pretty, but a step down from the ones in Santa Barbara proper due to the offshore oil platforms and smaller shoreline. It's billed as a beach resort, but most of the action is at the pool and spa. They don't have chair or towel service at the beach.  The mission style buildings throughout the property, along with the coastline views everywhere, are pretty spectacular and the main draw.  We found service to be friendly but a little indifferent compared to what you'd find at others in this price range. For example: room service dishes sometimes left outside our neighbor's room for 12-24 hours, room took two hours after we were told ""within 20 minutes.""  If going back to SB, would definitely investigate my other options closer to downtown... but would be happy to stay here again if they had a good room option or if staying with others who wanted to be here. .",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"We've been here three times now, and each time brings us back. Last night, the bartender (sorry but can't recall his name) was meticulous in making sure that my traditional gin martini was to my liking. He asked if I wanted it shaken or stirred, for example, and he wanted to clarify that I did not want it ""dirty"" (with olive juice). I asked him why he was letting me be so participative and he said that people who order classic cocktails are usually very particular with the details because they make them at home and are used to things being a certain way. I found this refreshing in this era of arrogant mixology. Kudos. ... Our server, Drew, was a hit from the start, when my friend dropped her phone in the crack of the unmovable booth. No problem, Drew said, and he brought out a long spoon from the kitchen to fetch it out. Though he'd only worked there for one week it was obvious he'd received good training. He had an opinion on the food items and was professional and fast but friendly as well. The food....we like the queso at Nada....it's probably what they do best: melted cheese (not processed cheese) mixed with a sofrito of black beans and garlic and onion. Our favorite entree was the chicken enchiladas. Flavors could be stronger, I like some more garlic and onion in my Mexican food, but for a chain this is very good.

The place is large and spacious also very clean. Arcade games are played with a reloadable card and are reasonably priced, $0.75 to $1.25 per game. There were a few issues with some of the games which I understood being the first weekend open. We had a pit stop to the bathroom and they were clean and they also offered a family restroom. We went upstairs and dined at The Bistro. They had a sushi bar and an adult bar on the second level as well.  We received good service and the food was delicious. The kids enjoyed the decor. We saw signs for the Side Splitters comedy club that will be opening up as well as the cycling classes. There were two party rooms one on each side. We are planning a trip back to the theater next weekend to enjoy a dinner theater movie. I did notice when checking out the website there aren't many movies available at this time and the seats were available in alternating sets of two to offer social distancing but I'm not sure how that works with a family of five. I guess we will find out. Overall, it was a great experience and fun evening. My dissatisfactions were the issues with the arcade games which I understand, but when brought to the managers attention he said he would take care of me on the next visit. One side of the theater had a family restroom that had pieces of pipe detached on the floor. They also offered water fountains which I felt should of had a sign or something saying off limits during this time.

"The staff is friendly but not accommodating when we asked if we could have a late check out since they were so fully booked. We asked them for a spot on the end of an aisle; we didn't get it although we saw another customer, maybe a regular make a site change. The hook ups are decent for the most part. Cable was iffy but we used broadcast signal since they are so close to downtown; electric boxes lacked breakers; wi-fi was typical for any RV park i.e., useless; the real problem is that the park is small and it is packed in so close with so many sites that your slide-out nearly touches your neighbors awning. Sometimes you don't want to know your neighbors especially when they antagonize your dogs into barking and then drunkenly complain threateningly about it like a Walmart customer in a YouTube video. We were only there for one night and they were cheaper than Yogi or KOA by over thirty dollars but sometimes cheaper is not better.",Business Category: Hotels & Travel,Review Stars: 1.0
"Yasa Yoga was perfect.   My fianc√© and I were moving from San Diego to Northern California and we decided to take the scenic Highway 1 route. We planned overnight stays in Santa Barbara, Pismo Beach, & Big Sur. The plan was to stay active, so we tried to schedule activities at each stop. We decided that we wanted to try an outdoor yoga session while in Santa Barbara. After a little online searching, we found Yasa Yoga and booked a Saturday morning session. Online booking was easy and they even supplied yoga mats since ours were buried in our storage truck.   The outdoor location was great (Alameda Park), the instructor was great, and the group was very welcoming. I don't do a lot of yoga, but I didn't feel out of place. We had our little Chihuahua with us since we couldn't leave her in the hotel, but the group and instructor were welcoming to our dog as well, which was awesome.   The Yasa Yoga experience was exactly what we were looking for and ended up as a nice de-stressor during our move.   I would recommend to anyone.",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 5.0

"Their displays and the size of the store are truly impressive. What is NOT impressive is how anything you want is always out of stock and even worse, unable to order! We have had this happen on at least 6 occasions on everything from lighting fixtures to dressers to an easel for my son's room. It's unfortunate that they create beautiful displays that no one can recreate because they are never adequately stocked. P.s. just today went there to buy a dozen or so plush dinosaurs for my son's 3rd birthday. Would you know that there were at least 40 on display but they wouldn't sell me a single one that was ziptied to the shelf? ""These are for display"" Fantastic but if you have none of the item in which you are displaying, excessively might I add, then that defeats the purpose, don't you think?",Business Category: Home & Garden,Review Stars: 2.0
"Staff was really nice. I sat at the bar since I was alone. The only off putting things was my server was on the phone on speaker with her daughter. Just go in the back if you have to. And there was another woman coughing for 10 minutes straight on one side of the place. And an elderly woman coughing two booths away. With everything going on right now it caused my anxiety to peak. I got the all star special which is my normal go to. And the chef cooked my bacon to almost burnt perfection. That way there's no bubbles or extra grease. Coffee was good, but as I was finishing the cup, I noticed some kind of dried on food particle in the cup and stopped drinking it.

"I have begun a new love affair with Livingsocial. I never use to buy any of these Internet type coupons.  Now I watch them closely and purchase myself new experiences at local restaurants. That is how I discovered Arcelia's in Soulard.   We arrived for an early lunch and were cheerfully greeted by one of the young men serving lunch. As we were being escorted to our table, the other gentleman greeted us as well. What a great start to our experience, it was warm and hospitable.   I immediately ordered myself a regular Margarita with no salt on the rim. When experiencing a new Mexican restaurant, it is one of the unwritten rules that you have to have a Margarita. For a inexpensive restaurant, their regular Margarita was above average in flavor. It was not a boozy Mountain Dew like so many restaurants try to sell you.   We also enjoyed an order of Guacamole with our chips and salsa. The Guacamole was fresh, creamy and light on the salt which is a bonus for me. The creamy avocado, was accented by diced tomato and white onion. Their salsa had a nice bite to it, but was heavy on the garlic. Which made me a little self conscious of my breath while shopping after lunch. The fresh, warm and thick cut tortilla chips were a perfect accent to both the guacamole and salsa.   Our server asked if it was our first time and I confessed that I was a Arcelia's virgin.  He understood and showed me kindness as he guided me to the most popular entrees. He even ranked them in order of the top three. I went with Chile Verde, which he claimed was their most popular entree. I understood why as I broke out into a light sweat from the spicy green tomatillo sauce, that accented tender chunks of pork. It was served with Spanish rice, re-fried beans and two tortillas. The SO went with the servers  #2 recommendation Fish Tacos. Which got Big, I mean HUGE bonus points by being saut√©ed and not fried.  However, I think the little ole lady at the next table had the best lunch. It was the Super Burrito and it was gigantic. It was the size of a small baby. I swear I'm getting next time and sharing it with my lunch partner.   Thanks Livingsocial for introducing me to another great restaurant.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I'm not sure what I just experienced but my friends and I were charged 75% more than everyone else on the tractor this evening, 10/26/19. Although we had reservations and paid over $20 a person and signed safety wavers, random people showed up, paid $5 each and got on before us. Then they proceeded to complain when we were at the coolers getting drinks saying that they were on the tractor before us. Honestly, this situation left a bitter taste in our mouths and made my first Nashville experience crappy. Tip: DO NOT PURCHASE ONLINE. Just show up and see if they have spots.

I love the openness of the restaurant and with two floors and even two bars (on 1st and 2nd levels) there is plenty of space.  I liked it so much, I'm planning an event there this Spring.    As far as the food, it was absolutely delicious.  I had the Ceviche and Crab quesadillas and they were both excellent.  The Ceviche tasted very fresh and not overly seasoned.  Just the right amount of lemon and seasoning.  The crab quesadilla was very tasty.  It had the crab, guacamole and onions, all of which I love.  The quesedilla was served nice and warm.  It was sumptuous.    The staff was very friendly and welcoming.  I plan to return as soon as I can and try out some of the main entrees.

"Here in Wilmington since 1956, this is as much of a local landmark as you can get. This is a classic eating establishment. And when I asked for Wilmington foods in the talk thread, this was one of the places that was suggested.  The menu gets into salads and chicken and all sorts of stuff, but you'll want to skip all of that and just focus on what they're good at. ""The Pit Special"" is available in 4 ounce and 8 ounce patties. It's a burger and if you're doing it right, it becomes a cheeseburger and fries.  And let me tell you, it was great. Nice and juicy. And best of all, inexpensive. This is probably the cheapest meal I've had in Wilmington.  I'm only disappointed that the drink options are limited to sodas and milkshakes.

A very large portion arrived with roasted potato chunks and two eggs on top of Canadian bacon on grilled English muffins. Her only complaint was that the yolks in the poached eggs were fully cooked.

"First and foremost, I am thoroughly convinced that anyone who has qualms with the service here must be severely delusional.  Having frequented this place (often multiple times per day) for the last 2 years, I have been consistently greeted pleasantly and enthusiastically by ALL baristas. I cannot think of even one time where I was displeased with the service.  The baristas here are top notch and keep their cool at all times despite oftentimes encountering chaotic lines that go out the door onto 19th street.  As for the coffee, it's the best I've ever tasted in all my years on this planet.  Perfect all the time.  I don't drink anything but coffee, so cannot comment on anything outside of this realm.    Ambiance here is great -- no frills, ""here's your coffee/ croissant - eat it up and enjoy it.""  Excellent high ceilings, plenty of tables, and nice, diverse customer-base.

"I'll join in the praise train, and say this place may be my new favorite.  The fact that it's also the closest to where I live probably doesn't hurt.  Th GF and I stopped in this morning, just a little before 11.  They were still prepping, and they're not officially open till tomorrow, but they had the doors open, so we popped in.  A gentleman (probably the manager), greeted us warmly, and I asked when they were opening.  They were still pulling chairs and stools off the tables and counters, but he said we were more than welcome to sit if we didn't mind.    We did the AYCE lunch, which includes most of the appetizers, nigiri, dessert, and maybe half the rolls.  The sushi was excellent - as usual, I had mainly nigiri, and it all tasted great.  The mussels were a little surprising in that they were cut in half - makes sense as I've seen people struggle to eat mussels sometimes, though it does mean the mayo-based sauce on top tends to fall off on one or the other.    They've got a bar on one side, maybe 8 seats or so - and I mean a drinking bar, not a sushi bar, which is an interesting touch.  Seems to line up well with what Kara mentioned in her review about long hours, and a pretty extensive sake list.  They've got tasting flights of sake, which is something I want to try sometime.  All the mentions of real crab had me excited, but I was a little let down.  Kokopelli's in Circus Circus used real crab last time I was there (though that was a few years ago, not sure if they still do?), and they were using jumbo lump, so they could make rolls with it and the like.  Reef's using imitation crab for that (e.g. California rolls still use krab), but they've also got either special or back fin flakes that they use, primarily as a garnish.  Jumbo lump is the kind of stuff you'd pull out of a crab leg, while special or back fin is a lower grade, mainly flakes and the like (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_meat#Grades).  Still, even if it is just special grade crab meat, it's a nice touch; just not something I'd write home about . . .   Tempura shrimp (appetizer) was good - actual flaky tempura, and not just battered shrimp.  Panko flakes they used were small, but the shrimp was perfect.    We tried the pot stickers as well.  I saw they were green, and was hoping they were wasabi-infused wrappers, but they ended up being seaweed-infused. We were also a little surprised they were steamed - plus for me, negative for the GF.  The GF loved her dessert of strawberry parfait, and my green tea ice cream was good.  So, while the food was excellent and had great presentation, here were the misses:  1) Soft opening service - generally good service, and considering there were only 5 other customers in there, very attentive.  In fact, I'd say too attentive.    2) soft opening menu - I ordered some panko crusted hamachi salad appetizer they had, and apparently it's not on their menu any more.  That's fine, the staff is still getting trained and learning, but the server didn't tell me that till I asked about it later.  I would have expected him to let me know as soon as he found out.  3) service seemed a little slow - considering that the GF and I basically had two sushi chefs, it was a little surprising how long some items took.  I really liked the Spicy Bomb (inari pouch with rice and spicy tuna, with cucumbers in a fan leaf garnish), but I'm not sure how they'll be able to keep those coming when they're busy.  4) server didn't talk to my GF - I'm not sure what was up with our server, but everything he asked us was directed at me, nothing at the GF, even for water refills.  The GF thought this was cute at first, assuming he was trying to be old-school, upscale, but by the end of the meal she mentioned being a little miffed.  Reminded me of when I was in Tokyo with my brother (who had learned a limited amount of Japanese) and his white SO, who had a conversational level of Japanese, and the servers there would completely ignore her; even though she was answering all the questions, they'd still direct all the questions to my brother in a blatant display of  of racism and sexism.  I don't think this was quite as extreme, and I don't think our server was being sexist, but still a bit awkward.  In any case, excellent product, and some soft-opening kinks.  Price is a little higher ($18 for lunch, $26 for dinner), but considering the GF and I could walk here in 20 minutes or so, definitely likely that we'll be returning again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

Tucked away close to Washington square is this jewel of a sushi place. We went there for lunch during our most recent trip as it was highly recommended by a guy we met at a bar - that sounds awful but actually after talking to him for some time he talked about some of our most favorite restaurant so I figured we had similar taste.   We had the shrimp / veggie tempura & spicy edamame (I would skip the edamame next time). Then we got 6-7 rolls and I could begin to tell you what their names were but they were fresh and very well prepared.   The have a full bar.   I would recommend Fat Salmon but rec making reservations since it's a fairly small place.   Go enjoy some nice sushi!,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Three Kings in the Loop is one of my favorite joints in town. Their Happy Hour is fantastic - half priced drafts and $5.99 appetizers! Their dinner menu is good and they always have specials of the day. Service here has been always good with a few exceptions of slower service. Three Kings has many vegetarian choices and they will substitute most dishes to make them vegetarian. The large selection of local and imported beer is a huge plus. When in doubt, they always give you small pours to taste which I appreciate before committing to a pint.   I really like their veggie burger and the sweet potato waffle fries. The portabella wrap and sandwich are both delicious.  Outside seating is limited but if it's open grab a table when it's nice out. It is nice to just sit in the hustle and bustle of the loop.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0

"After passing by the ZK numerous times and having heard great things he about it, I finally had an opportunity to have lunch at the Collegeville, PA location.   I had the lamb pita sandwich with a side of rice and I'm afraid to say, it was edible, but forgettable.  The service was first rate. Store was clean and atmosphere -all quite agreeable. However, I didn't go there to socialize or inspect the place.  I went there to eat a hot meal, people.  The ground lamb was luke warm, the rice was luke warm, portions were frugal. The pita wasn't warm or fresh and I was, sorry to say... unimpressed.   Will I give it a second chance? Probably not. I really like the mom and pop type Gyro places where they carve the meat like shawarma from a hot spit and serve it on warm, fresh pita bread with a heaping side of rice side and veggies.   This was definitely not that.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I rarely review chain restaurants but after eating at this Red Lobster three times for business trips in the last year, I felt it time.  Since I was a solo diner I asked to be seated in the bar booths.  Each time the bartender was waiting tables.  Tonight was Courtney.  Wish I could remember the others names but they've all been great.   I was surprised to see so many poor reviews as Ive had nothing but 5 star service and the food is always consistently good.   Since I know each chain restaurant has no control over the decor, I can look past that and rate it 5 stars for the food I've been  served and the attentive bartenders/servers.   Courtney made a greatttt old fashioned.  She timed the food perfectly so the main course did not arrive until I was done with my salad and app.   Tonight I tried the stuffed mushrooms, had a garden salad which was so fresh it seemed like the lettuce was picked tonight.  Then my favorite fried shrimp with loaded baked potato.  Perfection!!!!  I do not understand reviews saying the portions are too small?????  I would love to order dessert but am stuffed.   What made it even more special tonight was watching the newly transferred(from Jersey) manager, Jeff wait tables, make drinks, greet guests, deliver food......    if every chain restaurant had a manager like that there would be many more 4 and 5 star ratings.

They were quite dry and zero garlic could be found. The top was coated in butter, but it didn't make up for the rest of the knot.

I did a trial beforehand and Veronica spent a lot of time listening to my likes and dislikes (and soothing my fears) and came up with something that was perfectly blended, completely natural looking, and made me look like the prettiest version of myself. It was absolutely not a problem that I was the only person getting makeup done (no bridal party).  On the big day it was even better. Veronica arrived early (actually she beat me to the venue), was very patient with some inevitable interruptions, and most importantly the makeup looked fantastic both in photos and in real life - even better than the trial.

"Friday's is my favorite chain restaurant, I order the same thing, cooked the same way every time and those are my expectations when I go there. Pretty low expectations I would think; but apparently not for the bartender shay* (?). I feel bad that I can't remember her name Bc there are two other female bartenders who are lovely. Either way, the last few times my boyfriend and I have went it's left such a bad taste in our mouth (literally) that we'll never be returning again to this location. To begin we were told it was self seating at the bar and we could pick a high top. Well we ended up waiting for a server for about 10 minutes despite the bartender shay who was our server looking at us multiples times and rolling her eyes. When she finally came over it was unbelievable how bad her attitude was, she might as well have said ""what the fuck y'all want"" with her hands on her hip. When we ordered the food she never acknowledged or even said mhm as she was writing or when we were done ordering she simple let us talk then walked away, wth? Then to top it off it was a long wait for our food but I understand that's out of the servers control for the most part. Until we got the Jack sliders and the bun was hArd like it was warmed in a microwave after being left out for a little and the slider it's self was room temp...but ok still whatever I ordered the sizzling chicken and cheese with two side ramekins of Jack Daniels sauce as I ALWAYS do. The server never came back after the appetizer to do her two bite check back or see if we needed refills. We also were ready to order all together but Bc of her awkward nasty attitude we only ordered the apps the first time and since she never made it around until 15 mins after sliders were done we had to wait another 15 mins for entrees.  When they finally came out my sizzling chicken and cheese was anything but, the cheese was so cold I could see where the two separate slices of cheese were placed and the chicken was raw I couldn't believe it. Ms. Bartender was at the bar chatting with regulars for ten minutes before I could get her attention and once again she never did a check back on our food. Once I was able to flag her down she came over I explained and showed her my clearly cold food and she had the audacity to roll her eyes and take it away without a word. No apology, not even to say give me one moment let me get you a new one. To make matters worst it came out the second time with the cheese sizzling and the chicken raw. At this point we gave up thankfully another nice lady cleaned up and got us our check. As for that bartender, she received the first $0 tip I've ever given. This has not been the first time encountering her and this attitude.

"Stop!  Hammer time.  Okay, so I'm not the first guy you'll see getting in line at the hardware store.  Frankly, I don't have any business building things or doing manly stuff in general.  However, sometimes these situations are unavoidable, so I might have to make a trip to Edele & Mertz.  I've only been inside this store on two occasions.  First, my closet broke.  The landlord must have put a cheap pole in my closet because the damn thing collapsed within a matter of weeks.  We went over the Edele & Mertz, and the clerk was very helpful in our search for something more sturdy to mount in the closet.  We haven't had any problems with it since.  Today I had to make second appearance here.  We wanted to hang up some decorations for Mardi Gras, and I must have used the last of the staple for the staple gun.  Therefore, back to the hardware store!  I was greeted right away, and the clerk told me where to find the staples.  He even did a follow up on me, even though I already knew what I was looking for.  It's nice to have something in the neighborhood instead of driving ten miles to a Home Depot or Lowes.  Altogether, a good experience!

Great place to go for breakfast.  They have an amazing Buffett & staff are very friendly and accommodating.  I've been coming here every weekend for 12 years.   The only thing I'd mention is that all flat screen TV's in the common areas carry CNN only.   Perhaps they could be fair & balanced and play Fox News on at least one set.

"Vegan? Vegetarian? You will find a wide variety of yummy food. Still just as reliable as ever. If you want some authentic tasting Indian food this is the place for you. I have all the guidelines in place for Covid, but more than that... They have all the flavor you're looking for.   They have a wide variety of lentil dishes and plenty of delicious options. I had a curry bowl called korma. It was a cashew tomato-based curry where you can add any options like paneer, vegetables, chicken, and other options. Absolutely delicious! I'll probably be coming back in another couple of weeks. That will make it five times for me.   Take a look at the menu and see what speaks to you.

"Been here twice now. It's good. It kinda wants to be great and it tries to be yet just doesn't get there. The space is awesome and service is good enough. The generation X music sort of takes away from the true class of the place. I like casual and all that but if I'm spending 250 for dinner for 2 not sure the 80s Bruce fits the vibe. Nothing wrong with Bruce but that's the same with the food. The expectation is high based on what you see and read and then there is just something that falls short. That little detail like the playlist that doesn't fit the scene.  So what about the food? First it's consistently creative with Garces other Philly establishments. The dishes are super interesting and ingredients are important as they should be. Execution is a bit off. Cold dishes are too cold, hot dishes are slightly too dry and not hot enough. I had a really sounding nice duck agnolotti course and it came out as a shriveled piece of stuffed pasta begging for a broth. It was ok - homemade and all that - on top of one of many types of cremes of the night. I'll not be a snob and make fun of the tuna tartare (FYI it's 2021). Was good but super cold and the anticipated star was the wasabi caviar (or something) and it was non existent. Then they pull out this bizarre fried potato chunk with smoke trout. Gotta say it was amazing and nothing to complain there.   Service is great...drinks are really great...prices are appropriate to food and setting. This is no new hope tourist trap.

"I haven't been to this restaurant in about 5 years, but I used to frequent it whenever I found myself in Reno (which is quite often). Their food and service was spectacular and the ambience was just as amazing. They had a beautiful underwater theme going on. The filet mignon was to die for, as was the king crab legs and caprese salad.   Fast forward 5 years and the place is completely different. Gone is the underwater theme. It's now garish and hideous in an attempt to be modern and, I presume, more classy. To me it looks almost futuristic with the lighting and the weird wall decor. The food I used to get all the time has changed and what I did get wasn't worth what I paid. The little extras they provided have disappeared too. The service, however, is still extraordinary. They are as friendly and accommodating as they've always been.  This is one restaurant whose upgrade seems more like a downgrade to me. I won't go back and I wish I hadn't gone this last time.

"Thought this was cool concept for a bar... unfortunately it was not. Get there and greet the bartender... he doesn't even say hello and just says "" let me see your Ids"" very rudely. We ask if there's any happy hour specials and he says you get a jello shot with every drink. Not much of a happy hr but still optimistic. He also did not let us pick flavors (some people are allergic to food coloring) but it was still cool. The drinks were meh, not much alcohol and you could tell the bartender was half assing it. My fianc√© then ordered another set of drinks and we had to ask for jello shots this time because the bartender forgot... forgot the VERY BASIC ""happy hr special"" When it was time to close he refused to print me a receipt before sliding my card. Normally restaurants/bars print you a receipt to let you know what everything costs. I was only curious because this was one of the obnoxious places that doesn't show you the prices on the menu. I just told him to forget it since he was getting an attitude.

"I stayed here with three friends last week for Mardi Gras.   It's conveniently located steps away from Canal Street in the heart of all the parades and festivities. This was perfect for our much needed ""disco naps"" throughout the time that we were there.  The ""Who Dat"" folks know how to party.    They had a wrist band system because of the volume of tourists, which worked out fine, especially because they hardly checked them.  The room itself was a great size with extremely comfortable beds and robes.  (These things matter people).  Oh- and they had huge towels which is definitely a plus.  They offer room service and a few of my friends were able to seamlessly receive toiletries from the front desk.  We also had turn down service each evening.  Two of us stayed longer than the others and they transferred the name of the rooms without any trouble. Heading back to the airport, we were able to get a taxi just outside the hotel within seconds.  The only complaint I had was the hot water.  I like piping, scalding, melt your skin hot water in the shower and each day I was disappointed that the water never reached its maximum potential.  They have a small caf√© and restaurant in the hotel.  I would advise that if you want snacks and/or drinks that you just walk around the corner to the Duane Reade and save yourself a few bucks.

"FANTASTIC. I went with a group of 5 ladies and waited about 25 minutes for a table. We took a 4-seater and added one chair, which turned out to be a little too cramped. The waiter asked if we minded and we said no, but only after being squeezed together did we realize it wasn't really enough room. Regardless, we were happy with the service, food selection and drinks. I got the smoked salmon and was very pleased. Also, the cinnamon toast is not to be missed.

"It's been a minute since I've been in college (!) but the Trident Grill delivers on that sports bar near campus type of feeling. I had the buffalo chicken sliders and was there during happy hour so the price point was really good (another plus in the great cost of living column for living in Tucson). Each beer/app was only $4. The bar has an interesting military motif, especially in the back--not necessarily my thing. But the staff was super friendly and accommodating and for a sports bar in central Tucson, it is a good option.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0
"I have visited this Tory Burch location in the King of Prussia Mall a few times - and I have never been disappointed with my interactions with the employees there. Everyone has always been very welcoming, pleasant to speak with, clearly loved TB designs, and quite helpful in assisting me when I have questions or am ready to make a purchase.   The most recent time I came in with a somewhat bizarre request because I was looking for a bag that I had seen weeks ago, but did not take down the name. I couldn't find it on the website so I thought maybe I dreamt it up. I told them where it had been on display and what it looked like (PS I totally remembered it being maroon, it was black) and the salespeople on shift kicked into gear brainstorming which bag it could've been. They were able to locate it in their system and someone went into the back and pulled it for me! I flip flopped on whether to get it because of the price, but didn't feel pressured by anyone when they were trying to help me weigh the pros and cons.   It was a really pleasant interaction, and I appreciated it after a long day.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 5.0
"They're doing a great job of moving people through the dispensary. They should probably provide hand sanitizer outside, as they're handing a clipboard and pen to people while they're waiting in line. They're not doing a great job of enforcing social distancing, although they do have signs and suggested spots for people to stand. Unfortunately, the neighborhood is feeling the strain of too many people turning up and parking irresponsibly. That's not the fault of the dispensary, and I wager it'll settle down as more dispensaries start selling recreational.  I was extremely disappointed to find that they only had two medible options in stock (there were at least 15 listed on their website as available). They were both yuzu flavored. Prices are reasonable, taxes are... well, they're high, but they're high everywhere. But compared to dispensaries in CA and WA, prices, including taxes, are still pretty reasonable.  Budtenders seem friendly and knowledgeable.   If they really want to speed up the lines and increase their sales, they should allow recreational consumers to order online.",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 3.0

Very flavorful and a little chewy made for a fresh protein to eat.   The fried fish and oysters were LIFE! Cooked perfectly, seasoned to perfection, I am still dreaming about those oysters!

"The Mexican food here really does not hold a candle to some other places out of state. But that is the problem...they all are in the Pilsen area of Chicago!!!  So thankfully I can get an Al Pastor taco from Loco Pez. And for better or worse, they have a surprise dollar taco night. Which you can find out from twitter, or facebook, or their website, or whatever nauseating social media network you subscribe to. Great in theory, tough in execution, it is always jam packed.  Some how, some way the bartenders there keep it straight and cool. I applaud them for their amazing skill and patience! The margarita's are decent, but all around I would not suggest going to Loco Pez outside of happy hour and dollar taco nights.  It is a bit over priced and always crowded. The type of people who would rather shove you out of the way to sit at a bar seat, then be decent, make eye contact, and have a humanly confrontation.

The entire time she was making my return, she was huffing and puffing and sighing. Then didn't tell me what my return amount was and yelled and snapped at me that my credit card wasn't stuck into the machine to get my refund. She never told me to insert my card or the return amount so how would I know I'm suppose to do that. She treated me like scum for having returns. I shop very often.

"I used to HATE The Rack. It is known be flirt with being as douchey as the Hyde Park Cafe. I'd honestly avoid the AUCD on Fridays. It's super crowded and you might get puked on by a UT Student. However, the all you can drink for ladies on Saturday is a great place to hit before you go out at night!   I go to the Rack primarily as a restaurant. I like that they have a wide variety of food. I've got a picky eater as a roomie and best friend so it's great because I can get sushi and she can get a burger. I've been pleasantly surprised by the sushi's quality. All the rolls that I've tried have been solid, some even great. The yummy dip is a great appetizer. It's essentially spinach artichoke dip with crab baked on top. I'm not sure how that couldn't be good! The reason that the Rack isn't getting 4 (or even 5) stars is the service. I've been to the rack 3 or 4 times over the last couple of months. The first time, the service was good even though it was crowded. The next times we had the same waitress and it was awful. Last time I was there, I refilled my tables' waters twice after she would run past our table without looking up (even though it wasn't particularly busy). I also went to the bar to get another drink after waiting for 15-20 without being able to track her down. I wish I had her name because I don't think the service of the restaurant is necessarily bad. I got my drink at the bar really fast.   The rack has a fun, young atmosphere and great specials almost every day of the week. It's also conveniently located if you plan on hitting up Howard for a night out afterwards! I recommend it for a change of pace or if you've got someone who wants Mexican, someone else who wants American and yet another who wants Sushi.

"What a total disappointment!!  WTF happened to this New Orleans institution???? Ok, I'll tell you why; Ordered: ~Cup of Gumbo-It arrived 1/2 full!  We said something to our server but apparently that is their served portion! It WAS tasty but the portion size for the price WAS A RIP OFF! ~Charbroiled Oysters-Both the oysters and the garlic bread they came with had the taste of fresh charcoal.  They both had that nasty taste like you were licking a charcoal briquette.  The charcoals we're definitely NOT ready to be cooked on.  NASTY! ~BBQ Shrimp Po-Boy-  This was highly recommended by our server.  New Orleans BBQ Shrimp are my FAVORITE local dish (Mr. B's serves THE BEST, and yes, I have tried them at MANY local restaurants).  So seeing a BBQ Po-Boy, my mouth watered and I had high expectations for local LARGE shrimp in a delicious sauce.  I was served a Po-Boy that this restaurant should have been embarrassed to serve!!!!  They used tiny bay shrimp that were definitely frozen, probably from Thailand in a weak watery sauce!!!  Complete and TOTAL let down!!!  For $19 a sandwich, I should have been served large local fresh shrimp.  The little frozen bay shrimp were obviously cheaper.   Guess Felix's traded quality for profit. There are too many great restaurants that offer great food, this restaurant concept has run its course and should close to let a new restaurant offer excellent New Orleans cuisine.

"What a shame, really thought this place was going to impress me. Fell short in a few ways. Started with butternut shrimp bisque, good but no shrimp. Rabbit tenderloin next, it was also decent. Main entree was the seafood platter, best thing on it was the cornbread which shouldn't be the stand out. Not to mention one of my scallops was rancid, tried to figure out what exactly it was but couldn't. It was soo bad hoping I don't end up sick as it only took me one bite to know. The smell was horrible. I wish they would have tasted it to see I was not exaggerating. Now that is unfortunate and probably not typical of their establishment I would hope. Not too apologetic and their apology was in the form of let me feed you ramalade even though I expressed I was full. That was ok. Would have preferred a freee drink or dessert. Ended with cafe br√ªl√©e. Nope. Had two bites and was done. Only thing noteworthy was the sidecar drink which was delicious. Service sub par as never once brought out new utensils when others were obviously dirty. Just here grab your dirty fork you'll need it. Also they serve bread in a napkin which was good bread but they don't scrape the crumbs until after you finished your entire meal. So I ate amongst crumbs which in fine dining is unacceptable. I do like the fact it's locally sourced and seasonal so menu changes often. Guess I chose the wrong season.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Well, I was a Philly Brew Tour guinea pig, and I would never have known it was their first run.   I was lucky enough to attend the original Burlington Brew Tour in Vermont with a friend, and I had an absolute blast. Needless to say, I had high expectations for my home city. I'm happy to say I was not disappointed!!  Our tour guides were hilarious and knowledgeable, providing entertainment along with local history to break up the van rides between breweries. We visited Flying Fish (open space, great beer flight, just awesome--will be back!) and Lunacy (smaller, with unique flavors) before stopping at 2nd Story Brewing Company for lunch. Each tour member received a beer flight and sampler plate of 2nd Story's most popular menu items, including warm pretzel bites, buffalo wings, bacon grilled cheese, fries and a fabulous arugula, bleu cheese, & prosciutto salad. If you're not a fan of fried food, you may want to indicate this when signing up. I, however, thought it was the perfect array of snacks during a day of drinking. After lunch we headed to Dock Street Brewing (not my favorite; most of their beers tasted like sours to me but many tour members seemed to like that).  The tour ended around 4, but since it was such a nice day my companions and I decided to stop by Spruce Street Harbor. For those who have never been, it's an urban garden of sorts with hammocks, lights, giant games, beer, and food trucks. It was the perfect ending to our day.  For those wondering exactly how much beer you actually get to taste, the answer is a lot. This is coming from a 108 pound female, but I can assure you that everyone on the tour was more than satisfied. After each brewery's tour & tasting, we were also given the opportunity to purchase another beer of our choice. I felt like our guides did a good job with planning the itinerary, and I never felt rushed.  I honestly don't even have any constructive criticism to offer.  Call some friends, book a tour, and head to Spruce Street afterwards, because if you've been drinking since 11:30am, why stop at 4 in the afternoon?",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 5.0

"What a great spot! A beautiful restaurant, great service. Ordered some red wine that was delish, the we split 6 oysters and the ceviche.   The six oysters were split in to two types- I can't remember the names but the server took the time to explain the different taste profiles.  It was really great- wish they served a bit more horseradish with them though.   The shrimp ceviche was great- served with fresh tortilla chips. Very punchy with the lime.   Then main courses... hubs and my friend both got the squid ink bucatini. It was in a peppery lemon cream sauce. Some chili and parm too. Fish was very good- not over cooked. Again the sauce was great- I loved the spice!!!   I got the parm crusted cod. (Tried to snag the last rainbow trout, but took to long to decide). The cod was a thick cut- very flaky and fresh. The capers and black olive sauce was so different and good! It was tangy and savory - very addicting. Underneath was a bed of green beans- so a great low carb meal if you were looking for that. I wish I had some pasta for that sauce but didn't think to ask.   They also have daily specials - so look out for those.

I have been here numerous times now and have debated on how to write this review. It seems that if you eat inside or sit at the beach bar service is average and the same can be said about the food. If you are sitting at a table at the beach service will be slow sometimes very slow. With that being said if you are on vacation it can still be a cool place to go if it is your last day in town as it is close to the airport.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

My husband drinks quite a bit of water and his glass was filled often, without having to ask. We had 2 small kids with us and even though there isn't an offical kids menu, our server was able to give us a verbal list of items appropriate for our kiddos.

"I really wanted to have some bar-b-que while I was in Nashville; and everyone  told us that this was THE PLACE for bar-b-que and we knew that it would be good when we saw that the line was down the street.  First of all they try to speed the process up by having buckets of menus available to look at before you get to order, and on the night we visited they had an employee shouting directions to the people in line; and also answering questions about the menu.  When you finally get inside the main part of the building; there are multiple cashiers to take your order and give  you a number to set on your table so that the food runners can find you.  (There are no waiters/waitresses.) You also sit wherever you find space, so we were told we might not find seating together for our group of 10.)  I finally ordered my food, and found my friends.  (We were able to secure an entire picnic style table for our group with no  problem.). And I was amazed  to see that my food was being delivered to me less than a minute after I was seated!  I ordered a pork shoulder sandwich with one side, mac & cheese, because the  staff told me that it was out of this world.  My pulled pork sandwich was really good, not the best I've ever had,  but for the price it was very good. You add your own barbecue sauce, which tasted good, but it was very runny. I was not super impressed with the mac & cheese. I like mine with big chunks of cheese baked on top not all mixed in together the way this was.  Plus I wasn't crazy about the seasoning they put on the top..  A few friends got the ribs and they said they were delicious. Other friends got the ""redneck taco"" which was meat and coleslaw piled on top of a ""hoe cake.""  It didn't look that great to me, but the two friends who got it absolutely loved it.    Over all it was a very good experience. Food came out super fast, and the portions were big and flavorful. There is a full bar and you can't beat beers for $4 in a tourist town; where everything else was overpriced.  I liked the fact  that they say they do not have freezers or microwaves on the premises. When they run out of something they are out of it for the day. The lines may be long, but if you're with friends it moves pretty fast. This is definitely a place everyone should try at least once when they're  in Nashville!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"A few weekends ago, I was able to take advantage of their $50 hour long aromatherapy massage. I called as soon as I saw the special and had a date set within a matter of minutes.   I arrived, as requested, 15 minutes before my scheduled appointment. I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door by the woman behind the counter. She took my coat, offered me something to drink and walked me to the back waiting area. The light was dim and the music was soothing. On the counter were bite size snacks and a large pitcher of lemon water. I sat back and relaxed until my massage therapist called my name.  For the life of me, I can't remember his name. Maybe it was Steve? He greeted me and showed me downstairs to the massage rooms. He asked if I had any problem areas and when I told him that my shoulders and upper back were always sore, he asked if I worked at a desk all day. I do! Good job, 'Steve'! He left and gave me time to get situated on the table.  The massage was professional, comfortable and above all else RELAXING! He left me to get dressed and I met him upstairs. He told me to enjoy the snacks, stay as long as I'd like and that he hoped to see me again soon.  I love this spa so much. I have yet to have or hear about any bad experiences.

"As most people have mentioned the hotel is in a great location if you wish to be near the action in the French Quarter. The building is undergoing extensive renovat ion and it looks great if somewhat minimalist in its decor. The rooms are generally comfortable if a little stark. The biggest problems are 1) lack of service and 2)the nickel and diming for every amenity. As an example of lack of service we arrived on December 25 and had our car valet parked. The attendent stared at us as we hefted our bags out of the car. We schlepped our bags over to the front doors (not automatic opening and very heavy) and yanked them open and held them to get our bags through. When later we placed an order at the cafe (Powdered Sugar cafe) I noticed that the cashier essentially disappeared for 10-15 minutes while we were waiting for our 3 beignets. During that time another couple came in and paced around, hollered into the back hoping to get someone's attention as they had just arrived and were also hungry. No luck. They eventually left and went elsewhere. As to the nickel and diming, they charged $36/day to just park your car, the internet in the Business Center costs 45 cents/minute and in the bar it costs $6 for just a bowl of nuts. We ordered an appetizer at the bar, the Charcuterie plate and it was basically Boar's Head Mortadella, Salami and Ham. We asked for a couple of pieces of bread to go with it and they charged us an additional $2.

Our bungalow was on the second floor, and the amenities in the room were unlike any other place I've ever stayed. Attention to detail is evident throughout the resort. What I could not get over is how quiet and peaceful El Encanto is. Although there were several guests, we really didn't hear any noise whatsoever. I highly recommend this hotel as a great way to get away from it all.  All the staff we encountered went above and beyond to make our stay special. We were even offered an upgraded room which we greatly appreciated. We visited the gym and had a nice relaxing time enjoying a drink on the terrace. I highly recommend ordering ""The Charmer.""

Very rude staff. Drinks very watered down. Bartender rude. I asked for lime in my margarita and he throws it in the drink without even squeezing it had to dig it out with fingers. That's what you get with dumb jock as bartender. Waitress would not come to table I had to walk into service area to ask for drink. First round of drinks was 16.25. Second round was 19.25. For the same drink. Do not like having security guard acting like he is looking for trouble. Band is more of a karaoke type with most of the music being played on computer. If I go back I will sit on beach and make my on Drinks. Would never stay here better hotels in immediate area with much friendlier staff.

"NEVER GO HERE !!  I'd like to start by saying that this place was our go-to pizza. We are from Chicago and have not found any place we really like except for Pizza Squared, ordering it multiple times since we moved to Tampa in August, spending a good amount of money. And then we were ever so politely told, ""please don't ever call here again"".   One night we placed an order, we had relatives from out of town and we were super excited to let them taste this pizza. We called around 8 45pm and they said it would be about 45 minutes to pick up. I get there about 40 minutes later , and one person was working. That one person had NO IDEA what was going on. They did not have a order for our food, no name for our order, he has no idea what I was talking about. Finally, he found the order and proceeded to say that 'he just started the shift and the order was misplaced' so none of the food had even been started.  Okay, it was a mistake no problem.   More than an hour had passed and the person offered to make it and deliver it. Holding my credit card out from in my hand I asked, what about the charge? I felt we should get at least some type of compensation for the mistake. He tells me ' don't worry about the charge' .  Great! I was surprised that a restaurant was so proactive and willing to go above and beyond the for the customers.  I leave and about 40 more minutes later the pizza is delivered by the same person who had no idea about our order and subsequently made it. He was very polite, apologized again and that was that.   About 30 minutes later I realize I had a missed call from two minutes ago and I recognized the number as PSquared. I call back and a woman is on the phone saying she did not receive payment for the order - well obviously , I was told it was free. She then says ' I am standing with the man who delivered your pizza and he never said he told you it was free' WHAT?! I worked in the food service industry all throughout college so I never would internationally try to rip off a place of business . I explained to her what happened , she became VERY VERY rude and disrespectful, saying she was sorry for the misunderstanding but it was never meant for the whole meal to be free, only the  3$ or however much it is delivery charge. Taken by surprise by her tone and rudeness I replied I was sorry there was a misunderstanding that our whole order was not even made and then took almost 3 hours to get fixed! Icing on the cake? She told me unbelievably rudely,  ' I understand, please don't EVER call here again' and then she hung up.  In my ENTIRE life , I have never , ever , felt so disrespected and hurt by a restaurant . Especially one that I actually enjoyed.   I never made a big deal about the colossal mistake they made, they preemptively told me not to worry about the charge. Had the woman been much nicer, less accusatory, and reasonable I would have had no problem paying. As I said , I had my credit card out and ready to pay before I left the store.   Bottom line- if that's the way the employees are trained to handle customer issues , this place does not deserve any business at all, and I will make sure to never recommend this place. Pizza Squared lost two loyal customers and a new, large potential customer base. What a shame.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

This place delivers a delicious sampling of island food to the hardy denizens of Tucson. I ordered the chicken katsu with curry because it reminds me of my childhood days (yes, I grew up on Spam musubi) and although the wait was a bit long (lunch hour), the staff, owner were very nice and circulated around, checking on everyone and chatting. I was not disappointed--the chicken katsu was tender and fresh with panko crumbs. I normally don't like macaroni salad but their salad was so good. Two baseball sized scoops of sticky white rice.

"We were regulars at the family owned Japanese restaurant at this location and were sad to see them close, apparently due to a family emergency some months ago.  So, when Yah Mon opened up earlier this month we thought we would give it a try.  It was great to see that Ya Mon is another family owned and operated restaurant.  Andre and Janise, the husband and wife owners/operators, are incredibly welcoming. My daughter and I originally stopped in just to have a quick look and grab a menu but were so taken by Andre and Janise, the menu, and what they had done to the place that we decided to stay for dinner.  We ordered the Blackened Salmon with mango salsa and the Tilapia sauteed with vegetables, both dishes were served with a rice and beans and plantains. Both dishes were truly excellent in flavor, presentation and quality.  We also tried the coco bread (excellent) and the Johnny Cakes (also excellent).  We ended the dinner with an order of the homemade Bread Pudding and slice of Chocolate Cake, again excellent. With a hungry teenager waiting at home we added a to go order of the Jerk Chicken and a slice of the Coconut Cake - the chicken was very tasty (somewhat spicy but not too spicy) and the Coconut Cake, according to my son was so good that he didn't offer me a taste.  So, it is without hesitation that I can recommend Yah Mon to anyone who likes great Caribbean food served well in a great little restaurant with a chic design by wonderful people.  Make sure and visit Andre and Janise - Janise cooks everything herself and is originally from the island of St. Thomas!

"This place is amazing! I have yet to try something terrible. Typically, we go for the tenderloin, which is big enough for two. However, during a recent visit we challenged ourselves to try something new. I chose the smoked pulled pork and my boyfriend ordered the ""Which"" Came First. Both were great! We also love the pork belly appetizer option. We've tried several of the salads. Seriously, it's all good!   The beer is pretty tasty too. We are not big beer drinkers, but we can find at least one we like to have with our dinner.   I've heard the desserts are good, but we are always too full to get one. Hopefully, one day we'll save some room.  The atmosphere is great and I love the design of the restaurant. We've never had to wait for seating. During my first visit I was a little worried about parking, but we've always had an easy time with that as well.   Service is great.

"We've visited this restaurant several times over the years and it's OK. I feel like I had a much better impression when the Corner Bakery was new and they had this unique and fresh spin to their menu. They were pricey, but it didn't matter because of what they offered. These days, the menu has really evolved and my go to sandwich is no longer offered, which stinks because I try to order options that are all veggie/no meat. So I ordered their BBLT and it was REALLY good! They have their own spin on this traditional sandwich and I'm a fan. The bread was fresh and the bacon didn't taste like it had been prepared beforehand and there was plenty of it. It's a must try.  There does seem to be some upkeep/image issues going on with this particular restaurant. When you walk in, the front door alone makes it obvious appearances do not matter. Then I stood in line for a solid ten minutes because their registers weren't functioning. They also usually have their special fountain drinks, but those weren't available. Their baked goods were also few and far between, which was depressing.  But they do have take out ordering and pleasant outdoor seating. So they have a chance at serving the community and making it through the current economic challenges. We shall see what happens.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Three strikes aaaand you're out.   We were seated at the far end of the bar. As in far end where there was no chef, and no fish in the cooler. When the chef saw this, he ""had words"" with the server/hostess ( so at least SOMEBODY sees a problem here...)   Again, he was the only chef working, and it took fifteen minutes to get the first two rolls. I was exasperated at the deja-vu-y-ness of the entire sitch, and asked(told) the server to seat us at a table. She agreed that it might be better since we could fill out the order paper and keep the order organized. Then she wandered off. A few minutes later, I gave her the ""WTF?"" look, as we were still waiting patiently at the bar to be reseated. She ambled back over casually and told us ""anywhere is -fine"". Oh. Today must be ""Guess-what-the-server-is-thinking day"".   So we went ahead and moved all our stuff over to an actual table, I filled out the order form, and submitted it. And by ""submitted it"", I of course mean, ""I tracked down the server and thrust the paper at her"". The order consisted of 6 long rolls, 3 hand rolls, and four different orders of nigiri.   About ten minutes later, we got (what I thought to be) the first part of the order. I dig when a place will break a table order down and send it out in parts. It just seems like a more reasonable way to send it out, rather than making the table wait 25-30 minutes and then bringing the whole thing at once.   The plate had 3 (out of 6) long rolls, 1 (out of 3) hand rolls, and 1 (out of 4) of the nigiri orders.   But apparently that was ""all we can eat"" because that was it, nothing else ever came out. After we were finishing up with the first plate, I pinged the server to find out how long we had on the rest. ""Rest of what?"" is NOT an acceptable answer in this scenario. Again, I gave the ""WTF?"" look, and she sauntered over to the (new) chef who had taken over for the initial one.   I understand communication breakdowns can happen from time to time, but DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE throw us dirty looks when the server asks you about the rest of the order!!! You guys fucked up, not us.   Apparently we'd become an inconvenience at that point, but more than that, we'd had it with the repeated shitty service. So we told the chef just to cancel the order, as we didn't have time for them to un-fuck themselves and feed us in a timely manner.   I will NEVER come back here--gift certificates or not. I haven't the time nor the patience to repeatedly venture on in here, hoping that they've finally hired some new people and figured their shit out. It isn't even like it's convenient for me to get up there--I live in South Reno and this place is up by the Galleria/Costco in Sparks.   There are WAY too many decent sushi places in town (for approximately the same price) to expend the energy it takes to NOT throw a shoe at the chef when she shoots you dirty looks, because she's held accountable to do her job.   Sweetie--if this is that difficult for you, maybe you should go work the McFryer instead.   I understand that ANYBODY can have a bad experience somewhere, even at a place that has an average of five stars on Yelp. It happens, But to consistently be this bad? That almost takes effort.

"I am not one to complain but our experience was ridiculous. Staying at downtown and ordered 2 box deals. Gentleman to take order was very pleasant and helpful. Told 45-60 minutes. Called at 75 minutes for update and told ours was the next to go out for delivery when guy came back. Called at 120 minutes. Told that it would be at least another 35-45 minutes as one of the drivers got locked out of his car. We cancelled as it was not almost 10p and we had kids who were starving and needed to go to bed. Got a vague sorry. And I have a charge pending that I will be watching closely. But think...if I said ok, my pizza would have been sitting there for at least 2 hours. Gross.

Not sure what is going on with some of the fast food restaurants in St. Louis with poor service, but Wendy'a has shown no signs of decline! I will drive out of my way to get a spicy asiago ranch chicken sandwich from Wendy's! Each time the sandwich had been cooked to perfection! Warm, crispy and not over cooked or chewy. So delicious!

I loved that they asked her questions so they could use that to engage her in conversation and keep her mind off the procedure. They had a TV on the ceiling also! My daughter loved that.

"BUMMER! Gotten a few pedicures here and was very happy with my overall experience. I seriously had thought I found my forever salon.  But...  Tina the manager/owner is nice... until she isn't.  I'm expecting our second child and I wanted to do a little something special over the holidays and for our baby shower so I got dip/powder.   Tina talked me into dip instead of gel. I've done both in the past and I believe the dip is worth the extra cost ONLY IF it ends up lasting longer.   The nails themselves turned out nice. But less than two weeks my pointer finger nail lifted then popped completely off.  I stopped back by there and it was pretty busy, I discreetly let Tina know it hadn't been even two weeks and my nail lifted. She looked at me like I told her to die.   Instead of fixing it, I had to pay for a whole new set. Reluctantly... I did. (I'm an idiot). The exact same thing happened this time too! It wasn't even one and a half weeks this time and two of them lifted and came off.   I spent $60 for these nails and had hoped they would've lasted longer, AT LEAST over two weeks hopeful for three. Her and her male colleague literally treated me like garbage. Talking back and forth, laughing. They never apologized, offered me a discount. Nothing. They agreed to fix the two nails that lifted off. But made me feel ashamed like I had done something wrong. I'm a stay at home Mom. It's not like I went looking for dinosaur fossils the last week and used my nails as the shovel. I felt so embarrassed. They didn't even say anything to me when I left, nothing. I left there feeling really crappy. Not a good experience.   I won't be going back.",Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 1.0
"Warning...I am ticked so beware the CAPITALS! Husband and I knew exactly what washer/drier model we wanted to purchase. We sit down with Carolyn at the appliance dept. and find out they don't have them in the store so we have to order. We sorta figured that would be the case so it's fine, it's only July 2 and we don't move into our new home until July 15th. Everything good so far. They can't get the washer, due to a back order until August, will August 6th be okay for delivery? Ugh... but okay, we'll make do. We verify she is certain this will be the date and are reassured multiple times that it is a firm date. We agree to have both drier and washer delivered at the same time (thanks goodness). We paid in cash because if you ever decide to buy a house you'll learn you don't make big purchases using credit cards or even from your bank account right before closing. Fast forward to August 4th. I call Home Depot to verify there will be no problems with Saturday's delivery. The man in the appliance dept speaks over me as I try to ask my question, ""As you were informed when you ordered, "" he said in a tone of tired annoyance, ""you will be contacted the night before delivery to confirm and then on the delivery day they will call to let you know within a 4 hour window of when they will arrive."" I explain that this is all well and good but I want him to confirm now, since we were told the washer was on back order, that there is actually one available for delivery on Saturday. He 'checks the computer' and tells me, ""as far as I can see everything is fine."" I should have realized this was code for, ""I've got no freaking idea but I want this woman off the phone."" Fast forward a few hours and we get a call from Home Depot (I don't for a minute believe this is a coincidence) and they want to let us know they are unable to get a washer to ""fill our order"" and we need to wait until September 3rd. Not in any reality is this acceptable. They offered us a compensation of $50 and when my husband laughed derisively, upped it to $75. Yea...still no. Husband gets a number to call back when it isn't the middle of the work day. Call early evening to cancel our order only to find out the date we were given of September 3rd...yea, that wasn't a firm date either. We'd have been shafted AGAIN because they also didn't tell us it was a manufacturer back order, not specific to Home Depot. THEN we find out that we can't come in to the store and get our cash, nope, got to wait for a check AND the check HAS to be mailed, you can't come to the store to pick it up. Guess how long you have to wait for the check... TWO WEEKS! So not only did they play fast and lose with the truth but they are delaying us being able to purchase different units from another store! I get it that they don't want to hand over 3 grand at the counter but I should be able to PICK UP THE FREAKING CHECK within a day and not be forced to wait two weeks! Utterly ridiculous. NEVER EVER going to buy anything of any importance at this freaking company ever again!  UPDATE: Tried to write a complaint on the companies website but you can't! Not unless you create an account (which I did) only to find out you have to make a purchase using a credit card. DAFUC?! Now to figure out how to contact corporate!

"On our last night in New Orleans, we took a ride on the St.Charles street car.  We were looking for a place to have a late-ish supper; it's was about 8:00PM when we boarded the street car.  We passed many, many interesting neighborhood cafes as we rode, but the building that caught my eye was the Fresh Market, of all places. When the street car rolled to a stop at the end of the line, we boarded another one for the trip back, and I asked the operator to let us off at the Fresh Market when we arrived at the Louisiana Avenue stop. He obliged and we found ourselves mounting the stairs between the imposing columns leading to the veranda and entrance to the Fresh Market.  We came to understand that the two story building was originally a mortuary, then later a Borders book store. The veranda was decorated for fall with pumpkins, colorful chrysanthemums, and bales of straw. Wrought irons tables and chairs flanked the decorations for outdoor dining on the veranda overlooking St. Charles Avenue. When we entered, we were amazed by the size of the store's bakery and deli area first, then the dairy and grocery areas, the fresh produce and butcher shop area, and grocery aisles. We chose freshly made buffalo chicken wraps and eclairs for dessert.  Roy picked a chilled root beer to drink and I got kiwi/mango water. We carried them upstairs to the dining area, where we warmed the sandwiches and enjoyed our meal, while looking down on the main floor of the store.  The large wine department was adjacent to the upstairs dining area. We enjoyed our meal and boarded the streetcar for the return ride to our hotel.",Business Category: Grocery,Review Stars: 5.0

Came here for lunch with my friend and was sooo pleased with this place. It was such a cute restaurant. It wasn't real big though and we went at like 3 on a Saturday and it was packed so we had to sit at the communal table. Which is one big table..probably wouldn't sit there next time just not my cup of tea but we didn't feel like waiting for a table to open up so we just tried it this time. We got the chips and house guacamole to split. SO good.. the chips were amazing just the right size and not too thin or thick! The guac was delicious..so fresh. I got the pork carnitas tacos with a side of lime crema. Sooo good I usually don't like tacos without cheese but these were great the pork was so flavorful and more like shredded pork which I like. My friend got chicken gringa tacos and she let me have one It wasn't my favorite the chicken was good but it was a hard shell taco and it was kinda soggy cause of all the salsas and it was just too much. She liked my pork tacos and said she'll prolly get them next time. Side note: there Pepsi doesn't taste like normal Pepsi I think it's a different brand of soda. Also a little expensive compared to other Mexican restaurants I've tried but I would still come back or order from here because the chips and guac and pork tacos were so good but I would probably go later or order later because there brunch menu wasn't as good as there dinner menu. And we tried to order something off the dinner menu at like 3ish and they said no which is fine it wasn't a deal breaker but we weren't aware they had two separate menus.,Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 5.0
"What a colossal culinary disappointment. After being told by everyone I met that Mi Nidito's was the very best, most authentic Mexican food in Tucson, I thought for sure they must have discovered new spices and ingredients that no other taco stand knew about. After-all, Bill Clinton ate there for Pete sake!  I arrived at 2:15 on a Sunday afternoon having to park down the street because both parking lots were full suggesting it was enormously popular with the locals because nobody but locals would go out for Mexican food in 108 degrees heat. When I pulled open the door to the small cavern like interior, I was met with a huge crowd of families standing and sitting and every seat full. I put my name on the waiting list and placed an order for a Cadillac margarita for my anticipated 45 minute wait. Once I had a drink, I was obliged to step outside on the porch where it was cooler than inside...the hostess even said so!  As I stood outside watching dozens more people try to get a table, I sipped on my Cadillac margarita thinking to myself that it tastes exactly like Costco gallon jug restaurant margarita mix on ice and nothing else...certainly no alcohol and especially certain there was no Grand Marnier.    I'm now 20 minutes into my wait; I'm done with the Costco mix on ice and chatting with some locals about what could possibly be the draw for people to sit outside in 108F heat for an hour? I was assured it was the best Mexican food ever...and to be sure to order the shredded beef chimichanga with red sauce served enchilada style and side of rice. It is now 3:15 and I've been waiting an hour. My name finally gets called, so off to the hot box to enjoy the very best Mexican cuisine ever. Somebody at Mi Nidito's needs to invest a few tip dollars on air conditioning rather than what felt like swamp cooling as it was terribly stifling.  I was seated at the back of the hot box of a restaurant and as usual, the drink order with chips and salsa came first. I ordered iced tea this time rather than subject myself to the Costco drink mix on ice once again. I start dipping the oily chips into what looked like runny red sauce masquerading as salsa. It was terrible...I'm now certain the food is going to be terrible as well. Salsa is always the best measure of a taco stand. After 15 more minutes out came my shredded beef chimichanga with red sauce served enchilada style with a side of rice. Because I was enormously hungry by this time, I also ordered a cheese crisp with green chilies. The cheese crisp ended-up being the best part of the meal.   I dug into the hefty portion of chimichanga making sure to get as much red enchilada sauce as possible with the first bite. I made sure to savor every possible flavor I could because I was told this was the best Mexican food ever...but no...what was this? Where was the world class flavor that Bill Clinton clearly enjoyed? I could not find any other flavor than a cheap red sauce closely resembling the runny red salsa. This was pathetic. I've had better Mexican from a can and I'm not kidding.  In an effort to salvage the meal, I asked the waiter if they had a hotter salsa. I was hoping that maybe they kept the good stuff reserved for the locals somewhere in the kitchen. Again I was disappointed...the waiter brought me a bowl of the runny red salsa filled with crushed red pepper mixed in. It was hotter, but it was still terrible...worse even. I proceeded to have a few more bites and asked for the bill. The worst part of the meal was the bill. $38 for the worst Mexican food I have ever been served including $9.50 for the small glass of Costco drink mix on ice.   I've had infinitely better Mexican food roadside in Mexico for 1/10 the price and it came with an ice cold Corona.

"Located in the Reading Terminal, in the back middle-ish. There's so many different eateries here, but we saw the line to this place and we decided, we must eat here. The line takes a while though to get through as even though the sandwiches get made fairly quickly, there's only 1 cash register person and that was your bottleneck. We were torn on getting the sandwiches, but ended up getting the meat plate with 3 choices of meat - pastrami, corned beef, & brisket. As my boyfriend knows my love of rye bread, we asked if we could get a slice of bread and they did for free! We also kept hearing folks order the celery soda. I was like...celery?? Well if everyone's doing it...might as well try.  We got lucky with our seating as it's pretty much first come first serve in Reading Terminal. We started eating our meats and it was just drop dead yummy. Sampler platters let you sample everything (well we didn't get the turkey). The celery soda tasted more like cane sugar. Quite sweet.

I also tried the eggplant romano which was okay. The eggplant was so heavily breaded that you could barely taste it.   The shrimp linguini which was a lunch special was too rich. There was an abundance of think and creamy sauce are barely any pasta.   Overall, I would try to avoid eating here.

"Everything was pretty solid. I had the combo meats with brisket, pulled pork and chicken (I believe they are 6 oz portions and they let me do 6 oz brisket, 3 oz of pp and 3 oz chicken so I could try more). The creamy grits were pretty good, nothing special but how good can grits be?   I think BBQ is one of those things where you hit a certain level and that's kind of your glass ceiling of sorts. I'm never blown away by it because I've had great BBQ here and in other hotspots like KC (Oklahoma Joe's anyone???) That being said they hit that ceiling with a niche of serving the food counter service style, putting everything on an oversized metal tray with parchment paper, and having seating that turns communal during peak times. Sauces abound although the supposedly spicy sauce had barely any kick at all. I wish places would just throw one out there with AT LEAST the spiciness of Sriracha. But maybe I am in the minority and that's why sauces labled ""HOT!!! BEWARE!"" taste like a lesser form of Hot Tameles.   Cool place, check it out!

First time at HS. It was difficult getting a reservation. It always is after great reviews from patrons and the most recent 3 star out of 4 from CL. HS really steps it up for Collingswood. Once inside if you close your eyes one would think they were in a major city in the US. Love the open kitchen. Beautiful inside and out. Now for the food. Kale salad with hazelnuts was fantastic. Even if you don't like kale you will love this. Next the octopus. Perfectly done and one of the best I have tasted. This next dish they hit it out of the park and should make it permanent on the menu. Pasta cups with red meat gravy aka bolognese sauce. It was so good and had a little spice to it. And last a table share of a pork shoulder that they crisped up which was fantastic. Believe it or not our friends made a reservation for this Wednesday so we can't wait to go back.

The host got my number wrong and just would not accept that she could have made a mistake. She did not apologize and did not make eye contact after the situation.

The manager helped but it was my sons birthday and the situation just could not be salvaged.

"Mr. B's is a Brennan Restaurant that was recommended to us by friends who visit New Orleans frequently.  We arrived at the beginning of brunch and were able to get a seat easily, though it was apparent at that time the servers didn't have much to do at the start of our meal but stand back and try to remain unobtrusive.  I would say they were good at it; and I wouldn't have noticed them trying not to be noticed if I hadn't been seated in such a way as to have a perfect view of them watching us.  I only mention this because it was a little funny to be pretending not to watch the people who were pretending not to watch me.  We did have very good service.  We started brunch with coffee, which was a French Roast.  Neither my husband nor myself cares particularly for French Roast, but this one was particularly good.  When the server dropped off a small loaf of fresh baked bread with butter, we found it paired perfectly with the coffee.   We each had a soup course: one of gumbo and the other of eggplant oyster soup.  The crab and shrimp stood out in the spicy gumbo, but somehow the finish on the soup was watery and bland.  The eggplant oyster soup had little bits of tasteless oysters floating in it.  The soup had a well balanced spiciness that enhanced the eggplant to the advantage of the soup.    I ordered the Sweet Potato Hash with poached eggs.  The poached eggs were perfectly done.  The hash was as good as any I make at home with carmelized onions, sweet peppers, sweet potatoes and mild andouille sausage.  My husband ordered Shrimp & Grits, which had been highly recommended to us and were as excellent as they had been described.  The shrimp was wrapped in applewood smoked bacon and set upon a bed of perfectly cooked cheese grits (grana padano and cheddar). Just to make it even better the dish was topped with a light, smoky maple syrup sauce.  The complex flavors were distinctive and counterbalanced one another perfectly.  We put one of my poached eggs over it and enjoyed it very much.  For dessert we ordered the bread pudding with Irish whisky sauce.  This was a particular disappointment. The pudding smelled like a king cake, which is not one of my favorites, but the sauce had a smooth, even flavor with a good finish.  The bread was far too soggy, and judging from the texture would have been too dry had it not been drowned in the sauce.  Ultimately, the cake was so badly done that the sauce couldn't save it.  During the brunch, we enjoyed the live music from a trio playing trumpet, banjo and bass, which was very charming.  We will gladly go back to Mr. B's and skip the bread pudding.",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 4.0

"I was in town for a medical conference and this restaurant happened to be within walking distance from my hotel.  Since I don't particularly like eating alone, I was just gonna go in and grab some food to-go, but as it wasn't too crowded, and I was starving, I ended up just sitting at the sushi bar.  The food itself was alright.  I wanted a combination dinner (sushi and teriyaki beef), and I must have misread the menu, because my sushi dish came with six california rolls on top of seven pieces of sushi.  Talk about overkill!  I ended up taking the beef back to my hotel for snacking later.  The service was splendid -- not too intrusive, yet attentive.  I was even asked if I wanted my two dishes to come out at the same time.  It's a bit unnecessary, but an appreciated gesture nonetheless!  One thing I wanted to point out is that they have signs all over that says no talking on the cell phone while at the dinner table!  Now as that is rule that I abide by anyway at home, it wasn't a big deal, but I really needed to call my girlfriend (the sushi expert) to ask what I just got myself into by ordering nigiri!  Alas, my iPhone saved the day as I looked up that info at the table without technically breaking the rules.  :-p  Towards the end of dinner when I was about to leave, I struck up a conversation with the server/owner and she was quite friendly and talkative.  She asked if I needed more rice to take with my doggie bag, and when I asked if there was a post office nearby so I can go pick up some stamps, she gave me two to save me some time and trouble!

"What a great surprise.  After others in my group did tons of research to find the best places to eat  I found this place on a forum where someone spoke about their recent trip.  Plus, it didn't hurt that you could find a $50off certificate for $10 online.  Conveniently located in the French quarter and there was no wait to be seated on a Thurs night.  Started with the oysters and crabcakes both of which were delicious.  I went with the fried seafood platter which was also good and my friends went with the Grilled Tuna ""La Boheme"" with barbecue shrimp.  The waitress was extremely nice and quickly brought us over our free refills.    After hearing about all the other restaurants we just had to try while in New Orleans and all the specialty foods we had to taste, Oceana was one of the best at a fraction of the price.

"Its what you might call a hole in the wall place but as we know these are sometimes the best! the owner makes was there when I went in and kept me interested by telling me the story of Two Fat Dogs until I left, ill try to tell you what I remember.   The meat comes from South Philly a butcher that has few equals in the city. The bread is from down the street and is fluffy and scrumptious. They pickle the long hots themselves selfs and they are perfect with the pork and salty spinach. They don't have a freezer so you know nothing your getting is frozen. Apparently, when they cell out of what they have they close the shop heads to south Philly and cook that night so they can open up asap. At the end of the day, this place is committed to good food for the local crowd. If no one answers the phone it's because they are working too hard getting food out to the people in the shop.

"I love this place and the food is really good. I've enjoyed the gyros here and the quality of the food. The food I would rate it a 5, it's tasty and I enjoy it. I've taken away a star for service. I've been here quite a few times, since it's just down the street from my house and my order correctness has only been 1 time. My order is always wrong, but since it's so close to my house, I don't want to go back to get it fixed. Another star is taken away from value. I like their salads, but they are pre-made. Here's my problem with that, I don't like everything in them, so I ask for them to be removed. The logical thing to me, is replace it with something else, but they don't. So here I am paying about $5 for not even half of the small salad. It's not worth it to take anything off. I then ordered a large drink with my combo and it was about an inch and a half from the rim of the cup.

"Update: the owner contacted me and listened to my feedback, which was much appreciated.   I am so disappointed with this location. I have been here several times because my husband loves the cold cut subs, but I doubt I will return. I came in today and ordered a chicken parm sandwich. What I received was a sloppy, disgusting mess. It doesn't help that every time I have ordered a hot sub from this location, it always is served messy, with toppings that get all over the place. I can handle things being a little messy but when you leave sandwich is haphazardly slopped together and falls apart while eating it, it really just doesn't do it for me. The employees who put together my sandwich today should be embarrassed to serve something the way they did. Clearly, this crew of employees today just didn't care about their jobs because the restaurant was dirtier than I had ever seen it (hair on my table!), there were no straws for drinks, trash cans overflowing. I should've just asked for a refund and left. For $10 I expect better quality. My sandwich also had no flavor and was not visually appealing whatsoever. I'm also pretty sure it was microwaved.

And they have Asahi beer on tap, wow, really tasty.  And the Miso soup was spot on.  This place ranks up there for unpretentious Japanese food.

"I.  Am.  A.  Fan.    I was introduced to this place by my cousin and her husband.  My initial take upon entering was that of delight.  It's a large open space that appeared to be recently renovated.  Further investigation revealed that it has in fact been reno'd due to a fire last year.  Not overly stuffed with ""flare"", it's decor is just enough.    It is a cafeteria style restaurant.  My cousin's husband informed me that we needed to hurry up and figure out what we wanted because his previous experience was that the staff could get grumpy with you for not quickly ordering.  We got the following:  Oyster Poboy, Shrimp Poboy, Roast beef poboy, mac-n-cheese.  Dear Lord!  Everything was spectacular.  However, the roast beef poboy provided my taste buds with pure heavenly happiness.  At first, I rejected the idea of eating a roast beef poboy.  It seemed sacrelig since my idea of a poboy is fried seafood.  It ended up being love at first bite.  It was tremendously messy since they are generous with the brown gravy slathered on the perfect roast beef.  I suggest you strap on a bib and prepare to dive face first into this sandwich.  The oyster and shrimp poboys did not disappoint either.  The mac-n-cheese is a must as well.  Don't ask questions and don't worry about calories.

"This place is truly a hidden gem. Enormous patio, mostly covered, and bistro tables inside.   First of all, I love that you can buy wine by the bottle inside in the ""store"" area and pay for the corkage fee. Loved that, because when I walked in I saw a wine that I had on my wishlist in Vivino (thanks, Yelp CM Aaron) and I wanted that wine, not the Hess option on the menu. Awesome! (It was delicious by the way, C3 Cabernet).   The experience is a weird mix of upscale and intimate. Grocery and restaurant. We felt like we received very attentive service, people were walking in acting like this was ""their place"". I like that.   We had the medium charcuterie board, that came with a variety of meats and cheese, olives, and pickled veggies. The blue cheese on the board was hands down the best I have ever had and there have been many nights where I solely eat cheese, meat, and wine. The medium board would be perfect to split between two people over a bottle of wine. However, my husband, when we go out, insists on trying several menu items even if we have to take some home. He got the mussels, the fried ribs, and we split an asparagus salad. You will notice that in the photos I uploaded, I missed the asparagus salad because we literally immediately devoured it. It was perfectly prepared with an eggs and delicious greens- perfect citrus and asparagus can easily get over cooked and be gross- this is perfect! I will get it again!  The fried ribs were seriously delicious. It comes with this zesty sauce that complements perfectly.   I wish I could pick up this place and move it closer to my house, I would walk there and have a bottle of wine and a board.   Love the setup of this place, and I hope for it to have wonderful success. We will be back again. :)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"When you're expecting, your ladies seem to grow overnight.  I headed to Ann's, because they're supposedly the best.  When you walk through the door, you are instantly bombarded by signs banning cell phones.  They do a lot of sales with masectomy patients, so I get that there are HIPAA concerns.  I was surprised by the lack of friendly greeting when you come in the second door.  You sign your name on a sheet, take a seat in the waiting area, and someone will come to help you.  I'd think you could, in a friendly manner, say that when your customer walks in the door instead of posting signs.  It's not like no one was at the counter.  They just look right through you.  I did look past this, signed my name, and took a seat.  I was soon helped by a sales associate, and as previous Yelpers have reviewed, you have to throw some amount of modesty out the door for a fitting.  I was measured and wasn't too surprised to find that my cup size had gone up by two, as I've read that's pretty normal for pregnancy.  They suggested though that I get a bra three cup sizes larger than my normal bra - for more growth.  Ummm...maybe I'm just naive, but I don't know how much they'll really grow until just before the baby comes and after.  And how long do they think I'll be comfortable wearing a bra that's too big?!  I sucked it up though and bought two bras.  After a day or two of wearing the gigantor bra, I couldn't take it.  I returned the second bra that I hadn't worn or washed, figuring I could always rebuy if I ever did indeed get to that size.  Surprise...it's been about another month and a half, and I still don't fill it out.

"The three star rating is really 3.5, but I just haven't been wowed enough to add that half star.   They have lots of TV's so you won't miss your favorite sporting event. They also have pool tables, a dart board and some other games if you want to hang out with your buddies.  I will say that their portions are extremely generous and (burger lovers rejoice) they have a different burger every month, aka burger of the month.  I've not tried a burger there. Maybe this review would be higher if I had. I love me a good pastrami sandwich and I was almost disappointed in theirs. The pastrami was high quality but there was something very spicy in it (maybe spicy mustard) that just seemed a little out of place.  If you choose the fries with your sandwich, you'll get a HUGE pile of fries that you likely won't be able to finish.    On another visit I tried The Closer, which is your basic grilled or fried chicken sandwich that they'll toss in your favorite wing sauce.  Speaking of wings... they have several different varieties, bone-in and boneless. The smell wafting up from my daughters slightly-larger-than-a-golf-ball, garlic/parmesan wings made me think that I'll order those on another visit.  Their taps feature a couple of nice crafts along with your basic back-yard beers. Of course, the bar is stocked with the libation of your choice. Plus they do a nice job offering drink specials.  I teetered between 3 and 4 stars because I really want to be impressed by this place.

When I made the reservation they didn't mention the standard menu options wouldn't be available. So, when we had a seat the price was doubbled 79 dollars a person instead of the typical 38 bucks. So, I went in expecting to pay around a 100 and it ended up being 200. What I didn't apperciate was being retricted to limited menu and double the price. Also, the. Yelp check in offer for free covered strawberries. I was told they take over an hour. So, I couldn't get them I needed to let them know when I was seated. The restaurant should of informed customers of doubbling the price BEFORE BOOKING. I couldn't tell my fiancee sorry, no food for you.  I was just stuck with what I consider being greed. This left me with a very sour taste in regards to coming back. Top it off they added a  30% gratuity. The service was good but not worth the 40 dollars added to the bill.

The ladies running around serving $3 shots didn't seem to care. Those $3 shots are great. I love how this club has 5 floors of craziness! It's good to get away from crazy drunk people you meet. 5th floor is probably my favorite.. If it's nice out you can see all the city lights. I love the second floor because you can just chill with friends and enjoy the madness from the 1st floor but not be a part of it.. ALSO.. Be careful if your wearing a super short dress on the second floor looking down at the 1st.. I've had some creeps come up to me and comment on my undies after sneezing a peek.. Not cool.

My son and my husband ordered chicken tacos- she brought out beef. And our table was full of dishes that should have been cleared. She didn't clear anything from our table until after we paid.

"I was staying in Horsham with family for the night and was on the look out for a good place to eat. After yelping some nearby restaurants, we decided to head to Cafe Lombardi's and I'm so glad we did!  The restaurant itself is very small and the lighting inside is very dim. We arrived at the restaurant at about 5:30 on a Wednesday evening without reservations and were seated immediately. The service at this restaurant was phenomenal. Everyone was very kind and polite and worked very efficiently, even when crowds started pouring in.  I ordered the veal parmigiana and it was fantastic. The breading on the veal was perfectly crispy and the marinara sauce wasn't too sweet, which is a plus for me. The portions were large and although I planned on having leftovers, I ended up eating the whole thing! Too good!

I've been to this location 3 times since it has opened and it has never disappointed. The stylists are extremely polite and carry decent conversations. The reason they lost a star on my review is because, even though they cut my hair in great time (usually 20-25 minutes), it's always just a tad uneven. Granted, I have wavy hair so most stylists have trouble cutting it but I feel like a big name like Supercuts should be able to handle wavy hair.

The curries are good, but I was just in Thai flavor heaven after my lunch of Tom Kha and Thai Fried rice.  For the soup, I thought I had ordered a cup, but received what - by my standards - would be a large bowl.    The service is earnest and positive, but the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think they might be a little short staffed to keep up with cleaning the tables during lunch rush and I had to wait for a little for my food.

"Really tasty food, with its own unique flavors, which is something that I really appreciated about this restaurant!  I've tried the falafel sandwich and the original Palestine chicken schwarma sandwich (I'm a traditionalist). First time with their spicy sauce and the second time without.   As someone who loves to douce hot sauce over everything, I actually liked their sandwiches without hot sauce even more. Again, it has to do with the fact that medina has its own unique (tasty) take to staples such as falafel and chicken schwarma. There was just something else that I cannot pinpoint that helped elevate the flavors of the sandwiches. Perhaps it's their tahini sauce, I'm not sure what it is, just that it was additive and good! That's probably the best description I can write to differentiate Medina and put it on a pedestal compared to other Middle Eastern/halal restaurants.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"The first time I went here I liked it a lot. I decided to go back for my year anniversary since we wanted to go to Lambertville. I was so disappointed! We made reservations well in advance and when we got there 10 minutes early the hostess told us to leave and come back right at 7 pm. When we went back at 7 pm they sat us in the TINIEST table right in the bar area next to the stairs so the entire time I kept getting hit by everyone walking by and it was soo noisey. I told the lady on the phone who made the reservations that it was an anniversary and I wanted it to be special. Obviously they didn't care. We sat there for what felt like forever before the waitress came by and took our drink orders. We asked the waitress for a drink menu for martinis and the waitress rudely says they don't have one. The drinks took forever to come and so did the bread then the food. My pasta was a ""special"" which had no taste whatsoever. We were here for about 3 and a half hours because the service was so slow. I was upset the restaurant we chose for a special day was so awful but at least we got to spend it together.

"One of the best lunch options in downtown Tampa. You can choose whether you'd like any of the options as a bowl (8.99) or wrap (6.99). There's an option to add a protein for $2-5 each, and I typically add chicken or tofu. I've had their bowls and wraps, and both are delicious. The bowl is especially filling and I have been able to make three meals out of it. :)  Rise & Shine - quinoa, spinach, sweet potatoes, jalapenos, tomatoes, onions, bacon, 2 poached eggs, avocado green goddess. - Basically, it's an excuse for breakfast lovers (like me) to eat a second breakfast for lunch. :) They did not skimp on the bacon for this one.   Superfood - quinoa, brown rice, broccoli, tomatoes, walnuts, avocado, balsamic vinaigrette.  - Their most balanced customer favorite option. I added chicken to my bowl, which I think was necessary. There was a lot of quinoa and brown rice at the bottom of my bowl, but still enough of the other toppings to keep it interesting. The walnuts added to the texture and went well with the chicken. My only complaint is that the broccoli isn't chopped up as small as the other items in the dish.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"This place has really gone downhill. It was never amazing by any means but always a cool place to go with good atmosphere and decent food. Went back after not having been for a couple of years-the hostess informed us rudely as she sat us that there is an hour and a half max seating time for tables, which is just such an off-putting and inhospitable way to begin a meal at a restaurant. We had no plans to stay for longer than it took to eat and enjoy dinner (we ended up taking about an hour, maybe even less) but I have never experienced a restaurant giving guests a policy like this. I could see management encouraging servers and back of house to work efficiently to try to turn tables within an hour and a half, but communicating that ""requirement"" to the customers who just want to enjoy themselves and not look at the clock while they eat seems like an obvious bad choice. Anyway, the food was terrible. We got the sampler appetizer which was just freezer fried food with some weird sauces on the side. Very greasy. I ordered the taco salad with the fajita chicken, something I have ordered in the past at this restaurant. The taco salad was GIGANTIC on too small of a plate, but was pretty much just lettuce mix, shredded cheese, and piles of unsliced chicken at the top. The chicken was hard to cut up due to the instability of the super deep taco shell on the small plate, and the fact that it wasn't all that tender. As soon as I started cutting up the chicken, the salad fell apart and off my plate and all over the table. I had to put all of the shell in our chip bowl because it all just fell off the plate. I took me several minutes to cut up the chicken, and the whole thing was just a soggy mess. By the time I was able to take a few bites I was just over it because of how stupid the situation was. I tried some of the taco shell from the chip bowl and it was stale. I wasn't even tempted to eat it. It would have honestly been hilarious had our meal not been over $80. I remember ordering the taco salad here before and it actually being pretty good, with manageable plating and cut up meat. Don't get me wrong, I don't like my meat pre-cut if it's a steak or chop, but I've never ordered a salad and been served 5-6 big uncut pieces of meat on top of a lettuce tower that collapses when you try to cut the meat. It's just stupid and lazy and didn't taste good. My husband's quesadilla was ok, but was served with no sauce. We won't be back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

At first I was a little upset because I booked an executive level room and was told that we were but found out that we were not when I called down to see where are all the amenities.

As a courtesy she blocked off the executive level room for the next two nights and also added a discount for the inconvenience.

This hotel is full of amazing people that will go out of their way to make sure that your stay is up to par.

"Visited last night with my boyfriend for dinner and had a really great meal. I prefer this location to the uptown location. We seemed to have better service and had no problem being seated, however it was a Wednesday night with a non-bustling downtown environment. We ordered Buffalo tots to start and they were to die for. I noticed each of us taking our forks and scraping up the sauce left behind on the plate when we finished them while the other was talking. I originally intended to order the Steak Burrito without mushrooms. I then was told that they couldn't sub-out the mushrooms without pulling out the peppers and onions too, which leads me to believe that mix is pre-made. So I ended up going with the barbecue chop wrap and was very pleased. It was huge, tasty, and I have lunch for the day after. My boyfriend ordered the fish and chips and was surprised that the fish was salmon. You don't see that often in that menu item. All in all, will be back definitely for the tots and to watch a game or two in the future.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Overall, solid, but nothing special. The first course of polenta and eggplant was creamy and delicious, although the eggplant was a bit tough, not knife tender. Minestrone was a flavorful vegetable soup, but no pasta,so, really, not a minestrone. Salad was completely forgettable. Nothing wrong, but really, why was it even served, except to distract you from the wait from the entrees, which was reasonable.  Veal marsala, which the waiter told us was chicken. tasted like chicken, a little underdone. He assured us it was the veal, which I went with, but could never tell. So, if I can't tell whether it's veal or chicken, well, that doesn't really work. Sauce was great and tasty, but he meat was really bland, and not well prepared. Texture was off, again, couldn't tell if it was thin chicken, or weak veal. Sole was tasty, crispy, and the lemon sauce was awesome. Bright, tangy, with good herbs and balance. Pasta sides of angel hair were completely blah and a little mushy. Again, not bad, but nothing to yelp about.   Lastly, dessert. Cheesecake, which was nice, but with some kind of carrot cake shell. Nuts, dried cherries or cranberries, too much sugar, and too much crust. When you pulled the two apart, both were tasty, but why were they together? The crust completely overwhelmed the cheesecake, meh.   Service was about the same. Sat at 8, so it was well past the dinner rush, and not too busy.  Friendly, and attentive, but we waited much too long for the harried hostess to acknowledge us, and then she seemed frantic. We sat down, waited forever again,  but when we finally got served, the busboy, waiter, wine steward, etc, were all good and professional.   All in all, we won't be back, since we have options, and I think this place is coasting on past performance and reputation.

We walked into the bar-- not greeted and no signs what to do. This is a major pet peeve I have with restaurants-- just crossing your fingers and hoping guests know what to do. We ordered at the bar and seating was so weird! You have to hunch over at most of the tables because it's really meant as a lounge for at night with drinks. Food was brought out before our drinks and they didn't come until I was almost done with my food. Which the food was good-- better than anything else at the place but still nothing amazing, especially in a city with lots of good restaurants. I blame the staff in no way. The bartender was also bringing out drinks and bussing tables. It seems like you shouldn't serve a full breakfast if you're not really setup for it.

"I typically try to avoid chain familyish restaurants, however, a co-worker told me about the new table-side guacamole and I had to try it!  I'm disappointed to say it reaffirmed my aversion to this type of restaurant, as it was completely unremarkable and poorly presented...not at all like table-side preparation I've had at other (non-chain) restaurants. The staff here appears to be completely untrained and overwhelmingly young and inexperienced.  Our server had no idea what kind of beer was on tap and had to leave the table to ask.   When she brought out our ""table-side"" guacamole, the dish contained already mashed avocado (prepared by the ""chef"" according to the server) and 6 little sauce dishes with onions, ""fire-roasted"" jalapeno (not nearly enough to add flavor), a large amount of salt, lime juice, green onion and cilantro.  She began picking them up and dumping them into the avocado.  When my husband asked what she was adding (it was cilantro), she replied that she had no idea and had only been on the job a month or so.   In the end, it was really kind of a boring guacamole...not really what I was expecting.  It was overly salty in conjunction with the heavily salted chips and there were large chunks of avocado skin throughout. By the time we got to eating, the hostess had seated two pretty noisy groups next to us and right behind me (even though the entire section was empty) so we quickly finished our drinks and paid the check.

"Gluten Free Review  Used YELP to locate the closest most epic restaurant near me after leaving the Tucson airport and discovered ""The Coronet"" the dishes looked good, the quaint small building of the Coronet hotel reminds me of Disney.  Think of the Tower of Terror hotel, it's a relic but imagine a restaurant still open inside that is still pushing 5 star food... that would be this place.  Parked across the street, not much signage to find this place but if you see Coronet Hotel your in the right place. From the service of walking in to walking out this is truly a 5 star gem that should get national attention. The waitress/manager was epic at accommodating a gluten-free patron such as myself and the food quality matched the service. Drinks: Rabbit Cocktail was so amazing and literally tasted like bliss of butterbeer and something I'd find in Hogwarts SO GOOD.  Appetizer: Warm Olives was so damn tasty and juicy, I love getting all the flavor out by sucking on them, these were excellent and so fresh.  Main Course: All gluten-free of course, Got the Shepard's Pie dish but forgot the name but it was made with cauliflower puree and rice flour filling, GLUTEN FREE HEAVEN I tell you, so delicious. Also got the Chicken with Rice and was a feast of goodness.   Dessert: Panna Cotta and Caramel Bite and both were AMAZING especially the cherries on the Panna Cotta, nomnomnomnom.

Parking is generally a huge pain too, so I would not recommend this place to buy groceries.

"On a warm spring evening my friends and I decided to stop by Twistee Treat for some soft serves. As soon as I stepped up to the window to order I noticed the looooong list of soft serve flavors. Wowza! My brain immediately told me to get the cappuccino soft serve, which I did. The ice cream is mixed with cappuccino flavoring but I was shocked that it did taste cappuccino-y. Maybe I shouldn't compare with the soft serve at McDonald's, BUT the soft serve at McD's is only $1 whereas here is $3 for a small cone. To give them credit, even though the cone is small, they really stack the soft serve super high.  My friends ordered other flavors, ie. peanut butter, and seemed to enjoy theirs as well. The property is nothing to write about, small with a few benches. Twistee Treat is a good choice when you're in the Seminole area and craving ice cream, but I'd rather go to McD's or Dairy Queen.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Evacuated from the Woolsey Fire, drove 5 hours and paid $350 for a room to check in and find they are doing construction in the hotel (no mention and no offer of discount on room). Woken up at 9:30PM to a miter saw and power drill.  Called the front desk and complained and they said they would ask them to stop.  5 minutes later the saw was being used again.  Had to get dressed and walk down to the front desk to call the GM and ask them to stop the noise.  Called for shampoo in the morning and they said they don't have the staff and we need to come down and get it from the front desk or try to find a housekeeper in the hallway.  TERRIBLE SERVICE for a full hotel charging $350 a night and unacceptable to not disclose construction when booking our room and letting it continue to 9:30pm.

"I still like the food, I will say I have to stay away from the chicken tenders as I have tried it 3 times and each time I get really really sick (TMI). The chickens have gotten smaller, and the wings are smaller as well seems like they have made some changes.  The service isn't anything to write home about, as I waited on hold for and hour while I heard all conversations about customers coming in and how tired they were of being at work on a Friday night!   Looks like they have hired some new faces but one guy in particular (California guy) total douchebag!!! RUDE, IMPATIENT, TOTAL ASSHOLE! He doesn't take ownership for his mistakes, and speaks to other workers as if he's someone special! Last I checked he was just a regular worker bee! If it wasn't for the current girl working there I would have left without ordering, she walked out from the register to wipe a table for a family of 6 and apologized for the douchebags comments!  I am giving this place one last chance, if the service and the attitude isn't in check this place will lose my business and I will drive the 10miles to Hatie B's or Prince's to get my chicken! If this place has new owners I hope they take a hard look at their business and make some changes!

For the past two years I've been working at an up-scale nail salon where I was the only person who hadn't come to America from Vietnam in the past 10-15 years, and man did those ladies know how to cook!! So as you can imagine I was a little worried since this was my first experience with Vietnamese food in New Orleans, and though it was a Vietnamese-creole mix, it was delicious! I tried the pork vermicelli bowl and it was great! It wasn't exactly traditional, but they played on traditional flavors well and paired them with the Creole style very well.

I got the rib tip meal with a side of mac and cheese and potato salad.  The rib tips were very good but I thought there were too much sauce on it.  I would recommend getting the sauce on the side.

There was nothing wrong with my old battery, and it was fully charged, yet Dave proceeded to sell me a new one for $53, pretending that the 12.5% was low.

"Lolita has been right around the corner from the buildings I've worked in for years, I've always wanted to check it out, so when my Dad decided to have his birthday dinner there, I was really looking forward to finally seeing what this place was all about.  Unfortunately, I was stressed about a couple things, so I didn't enter in the best of moods.  FIRST IMPRESSIONS: The big windows give you a pretty good impression of what it looks like inside, so no real surprises, the feel is very warm and cosmopolitan.  There were quite a few tables packed into the small space, in fact our table of three was no more than a foot or two apart from the people next to us.  THE DRINKS/APPETIZERS: Lolita bills itself as a BYOT, and there's a conveniently-located liquor store right around the corner on Chestnut st.  They have the traditional lemon-lime mix, or blood orange and mint, of course we went with the latter in an exploratory fashion.  We ordered appetizers of guacamole and queso fundido, which come with amazing malanga de coco, plantain, and corn chips.  The guac was very good, but the queso fundido was waaaaay too smoky for my palette.  THE MAIN COURSE: I ordered vaca con budin de papas, which was a braised short rib with smoked bacon-chayote potatoe gratin.  The texture of the meat was sublime, you could tell the meat just fell off the bone and onto the plate (even though I would have preferred the bone-in so I could have enjoyed this phenomenon myself).  The taste, however, was a miss for me.  By this point, I realized that while I liked the food, it reminded me very much of Grocery (also owned by the couple that manages Lolita and Bindi across the street), in that there is always some kind of ""secret ingedient"" in everything...it's just not the kind of taste I go for, so I think some people will love the food, others notsomuch.  I can't remember what my parents ordered, I tasted both, and both were platable, but also fell into the above in terms of taste.  Presentation, however, was excellent, loved the creativity that went into the dishes.  For dessert, my Dad ordered their bread pudding, which they brought out a candle for, but then left us to sing happy birthday alone...I get it, this isn't TGI Friday's, I always hated having to sing happy birthday when I was a bus boy as a summer job in college, it's cool.  THE SERVICE: Very friendly, competent, well-paced, I'm not sure if they feel the managerial lash that gets rumored about Thirteenth Street, but there was a measure of discipline, maybe inadvertent, that was good to see.    THE CHECK: Pricing is reasonable, I suppose, for a boutique BYO that serves ""Contemporary Mexican.""  There's an $18 minimum per person for food, entrees run in the mid-twenties.  By the end of our dinner, two 8+ tops had moved in and engulfed us in loud-talking and near-shouting from two angles, kind of annoying.  El Vez, just down the street was packed as well, we couldn't help but wonder what kind of competition the two restaurants are giving each other, tho I'd say the respective tastes and atmospheres are worlds apart.  THE BOTTOM LINE: Absolutely worth trying, even once just to see if it suits your taste buds, the atmosphere is relaxing when it's slow, but a bit loud for dinner rush.  The margaritas and chips were great, food is beautifully-prepared and well-sourced, but the tastes won't thrill some.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"After reading the reviews left by others, I had high hopes, unfortunately felt a little flat. I only deducted one star because I felt that this may have been a server issue and not a good reflection of the business.   The chips and salsa were pretty standard fare. Both my meal and my friends meal were pretty good. The atmosphere was nice with a good mix of seating options. The parking can be a little cramped, but there is some additional parking in the back and street parking.   Our service was pretty poor. We had asked for guac, but never received it. Our meals came out fairly quickly, but then our server took forever to bring the checks, pick up the checks and to run our credit cards. Interesting because at that point the lunch rush was pretty much through.

Carol at Grazia was recommended to me when I moved to the area by a colleague and I am so happy I took her recommendation.  I travel for work and the online booking tool makes it easy for me to book an appointment on short notice when I find time in my schedule. The staff at the desk is always incredibly friendly and attentive. I've had a couple of different services by different staff and have been happy each time but Carol is definitely my go to. She does my eyebrows routinely and has been prepping my skin for my upcoming wedding for the past few months. My skin has never looked better and I can't recommend Carol or Grazia enough.,Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 5.0

"Were to start. First off, the owner & Amy are extremely unorganized. They have giving me three different dates to when they would have more French Toast shirts for kindergarten. Went the first time when they opened at 10am ""sold out"" went the second time when they opened at 10am ""sold out"" went the third time & again SOLD OUT! I've asked if she would just take the two shirts that aren't French toast & put those back on the rack (not asking for a refund) asking them to just call me when two French toast shirts come in since I've already paid it would be a order. They said no. Okay, at this point I'm beyond aggravated & even had to get the police involved. Needless to say they do not honor their word. A company should not give you 3 pacific days that a order should be in & none of the dates the shirts came in. & here I am still waiting & the owner tried to tell me she will not even do an exchange for me. Well, on the wall it clearly states will exchange with receipt. Lucky the police stated that she has to honor her word with the exchange with receipt. So the owner said that she isn't ordering anymore French Toast shirts just to be spiteful. Shady business lady.

"I should probably give this place a second chance at some point down the road, but for right now this is my review.  And this is just how it's gonna be.  I mean with the title, ""Pig,"" I thought this would have excellent BBQ.  I guess I could go back to try that... maybe... probably not... but maybe.  I ventured here for my friend's 30th birthday party combined with New Year's Eve party with an 80s theme (although, humourously... or not so... no one except the birthday girl and her two sisters actually decked out in 80s theme gear... maybe New Year's Eve 2011 wasn't such a good plan to relive the 80s... just sayin').  The place is small and off the beaten path.  The service was not at all timely or anywhere close to decent (and we were definitely the only party there at 8:00pm when we arrived and the largest party there for the entire evening.  So... to forget our drinks and forget our food... not a good move).  In fact, I ordered a water at 8:30pm *yesterday* and at 4:48pm today (granted I'm home now) I'm still waiting on that water.  I tasted some of the potato wedges and they were ridiculously salty... to the point of inedible.  I also tasted someone else's potato skins... also salty.  Look, you're a bar and unless you're a nice bar like Virago or The Patterson House, then I don't expect much in terms of good food.  So, the fact that you couldn't even exceed my extremely low expectations is a bit sad.  There are better bars in Franklin like The Red Pony with better food and better service and a wider selection of choices.  I'd just steer clear of this schlop.",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 1.0
"Tried it once, had a terrible experience on the patio. Tried it again - much better overall but then...the bill came.  It was Oh-so vino Wednesdays. 50% off wine is a pretty common (and awesome) special that draws my friends out to restaurants and bars all over town. We ordered 3 bottles of wine and only found out when the bill came that bottles of wine are not included in the special.   I feel like this is something that the server should have disclosed when we ordered the first bottle. I've never been anywhere that has these limitations and there was no marketing on the signage or table to help us educate ourselves.  My second complaint is about the fire on the patio - be warned you will smell like you were camping.  I won't go back - too many other rad places downtown.  If you have to - eat inside if there is a fire on the patio and make sure you ask for details and restrictions on the ""specials"".",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 2.0
"3 stars just for the food. Service and sazeracs were horrible. Went there at 8pm on a Monday night, looked to be decently busy. We were told there was no cleaned tables for a party of two, but we can sit at one of the two bars. As a date night, we preferred a table. We walked to the further bar and the different dining rooms were maybe 40% full. Went back to hostess to ask to put our name down and she said a table just got cleared. Our waitress made two squaky comments regarding our state of origin that I didn't feel was appropriate. She recommended the sazeracs so we got two of them, a dozen of raw and charbroiled oysters, and gator bites (wanted a wedge salad too but they were somehow out of it). The two drinks took 15 minutes and as a bartender myself I knew they sat on ice too long and lacked flavored (just tasted brandy). Another server gave us our oysters and our waitress never came to fill our waters or ask how anything was. The food was good. I would recommend to try but would not return. You can't mess up oysters and can get better sazeracs for cheaper elsewhere. (They were $13 which we were not informed about  because when we asked for a drink menu our server said ""they're not necessary they only contain our drinks specials. But I'll grab one if you want."") Hope this helps!   Ps. The Original French Market has better food, hospitality AND location!!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I had dinner here for the first time tonight with my husband, a friend and my kids (4 and 4 months). We were a little worried about bringing the kids because we have never been here before. We got seated immediately, and we're offered drinks. Before we even order the food, the waiter told us they didn't have a kids menu but would be happy to make a smaller burger, or do some pasta but in a smaller size for the kid. That set us at ease. We order grilled artichoke, and blue cheese garlic bread. It was delicious! The artichoke was cooked perfectly and had balsamic drizzled over it which was a fabulous touch. The bread had the perfect amount of blue cheese and garlic! Yum! My husband ordered the ribeye, and I ordered the pork chop. The ribeye came with a side of red skin mashed potatoes and asparagus, and my pork chop came with the same potatoes and a cranberry apple chutney. It was heaven eating this plate of food. The pork chop was so thick ( mind you that they do warn you it would take 25 minutes, but boy was it totally worth it! I don't mind waiting if the food is good) and not over cooked but moist and juicy! It has a sweet glaze on it that was perfect. Probably one of the best meals I have had in town in quite some time. All the while. Our drinks never got low, not even our waters. The serves was 5 stars, our waiter was polite, and courteous, and always checked in to see how things were going, and keep us updated on our food. Now I wasn't gonna get dessert, but with food like this, how could you not? I got a mixed berry crisp and our friend got pineapple fosters. My son got a carmel brownie ice cream. My son loved his ice cream.. which they had all these awesome favors (guess they make ice cream in house?). The pineapple fosters was delicious fresh pineapple over coconut ice-cream. This pineapple was so sweet, the waiter said they cut it fresh everyday. My mixed berry crisp has toasted granola on top of a bounty of baked berries with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. You could smell the toasty granola when they set the plate down. It was such a satisfying, lovely, enjoyable meal. Oh I will be back again, and letting everyone know how awesome this place is.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"This is the station that is closest to my apartment and I just wish it was a little nicer. Girard Ave is surrounded by up and not really coming any more buildings. Straight up fancy places dot the area. But right by this station there is a sketch strip club, dirty side walks, and weird people. My family was actually afraid for me when they saw this station. I know that it's relatively safe but someone just passing by to get to the Fillmore or any of the popular bars might think otherwise. The other frustrating thing is that right now there is only 1 turnsile for tokens - the rest are in progress for Septa Key. Hopefully, Septa key gets enacted soon. Finally, you can only access the East bound platform by entering on the west bound platform and taking a bridge over. It's very annoying!

I came in 15 mins before my start time and left thirty mins early than I was suppose too. My lashes were falling out and were not even or FULL. She was texting while doing my lashes and that even took more time away from my fullset. Then, I called the manager and asked to get them filled in more and having 50% full lashes she got them up to 80% still I was not very happy because I still did not get my full 100% lashes and now my cycles won't be the same at least they were nice and still helped me out.

It was necessary to exit the park and enter on the back side. Not very customer friendly.  The NPS system needs to step up with the rest of the world and become more leashed pet friendly. No pets on unpaved trails? Silly. No bottled water available, more silly.  Address the 1% who would abuse, not the 99% who don't  and it would be a great teaching moment.

"It isn't often that I find food that needs nothing. I try to objectively assume that there is always room for improvement. Plenty has shattered that belief and ruined me for all other sandwiches ever. When I say that I wept as I ate their Tasso Ham Panini, it is no exaggeration. It was by all means and without a doubt the best sandwich I've ever eaten. I didn't want it to end. It will be a dangerous life I lead from now on, what with having them right down the block. So I'm back for dinner and I have the Brisket Panini, and it is like having an out of body experience. I can hear no sounds while eating it. Nothing can penetrate the wave of bliss I'm feeling. I want everyone I know to try this, I want to shout it from the rooftops! PLENTY IS HERE, NEVER HAVE AN AVERAGE SANDWICH AGAIN!!!!  Everything is locally sourced. The meats are cured, butchered and prepared in house. The sauces are all made in house. Unbelievable. After the Brisket, I can't understand for the life of me why anybody would waste their money at Geno's or Pat's for a boring old cheesesteak, when they can have the Holy Grail of beef and bread right here at Plenty.

What a pleasant surprise! My wife an I have been looking for a place for good Chinese since we left Philadelphia about 6 years ago. After trying more than a half dozen places in the area surrounding Haddonfield we had given up on discovering any place with even passable food. Classic Asia left a menu on our door so we decided to order delivery. The food was fantastic! We ordered the chicken and broccoli and Kung Pao dinner special with egg roll. The chicken was large thin slices of white meat and the vegetables were crisp and not overcooked (which is so often the case with local Chinese food). The egg rolls were tasty and not greasy. The white rice was cooked to perfection. I'm looking forward to trying the Singapore noodles next. Great start Classic Asia!,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

Our food took over an hour to come out and 5 out of 8 meals were cold, not warm, but cold. I can't really say anything positive about this place as it was a total disaster. Never saw a manager after an hour wait on the meals and again 5 of 8 meals being served cold. Two meals came out 10 minutes later as the waiter stated the kitchen missed the order??? Maybe they're better during the week, but I'll never go back as there's too many great restaurants in West Chester.

My whole party was done eating & had to wait 15-20 after for me to even receive my food, & it was burnt on the edges & soft in the middle. When I asked the staff to comp my meal to make up for the wait & error, they rolled their eyes, & were gossiping rude comments about me while I was standing right in front of them. No remorse of apologies, just rude glares & comments. All of the staff interactions ended up turning a slightly annoying situation in to one of the worst dining situations I have ever had. As someone who has worked in multiple service positions, I understand thst mistakes can happen, but I would never treat a customer the way the did to me.

I have no idea why it has such high reviews because when my husband and I went there at 6:00pm on a Saturday we were the only ones there while the rest of the plaza was packed. The waitress was extraordinarily rude and acted like she wanted nothing to do with us when asking for our order. We ordered two dinner entrees that were supposed to come with soup and salad but the waitress was too busy socializing to bring us them. When our overpriced food came out and we questioned her as to the soup and salad, she lied saying that our meal did not include them even though the menu states it does. Also, we ordered the tuna pizza and were insanely disappointed at how tiny it was and how little tuna was actually on it. It was basically just avocado on a tiny scallion pancake. We observed the sushi ""chefs"" microwaving our food as we were waiting for the dinner. The whole experience was bizarre and we ended up having to speak to the manager who really had nothing to say.

My recommendation is to order take out if you must eat here but nothing here is exceptional. No one here cares about customer service. He even brought out the wrong food and after 10 min trying to chase him down we ended up eating the wrong plate as he was only attending the other table. I've been here many times before and the customer service has never been good but it also had not been this bad. No one apologized to. No one acknowledged our concerns and definitely one tried to make reparations. The next time we saw our waiter he asked from across the restaurant ""you want dessert?""

"I've been holding off for somewhere special for my 600th review, and this is it! I knew right after my delicious meal here that it was deserving.   I am a member of blood and sand but just made it here for the first time. Because I work during the week, A weekend was the only time that I can make it here. Now they serve brunch so I was good to go for trying it.   The setting is gorgeous and we were lucky enough to come on a gorgeous day so we sat outside. Service was great the whole time. Food was timed perfectly.   I started with the hummus and pita. This is a little outside the norm as far as hummus goes because it has some chopped veggies and cashews on top. I liked the twist. The pita was quite possibly the best I've ever had. I ordered extra and was glad I did. It was truly drool-worthy. There was a lot, so I took some home.   I ordered a side of fries, which comes with a sriracha ketchup/mayo mix dipping sauce. It was delicious and not too spicy. It was a huge basket and fed two of us with no problem.   I also got the homemade yogurt with honey, homemade granola, cashews and fresh fruit. It was a large portion. The yogurt alone was a bit too bitter but mixed with the other stuff it was good. I took some home and mixed a bit more honey and fruit with it and it was perfect!   They serve agua fresca here, and I got a lovely honeydew lemongrass one that was very refreshing.

We walked in and immediately were impressed with how nice the hotel was (and the air conditioning!) and decided to have a meal here i wanted to try the oysters and he wanted to try alligator meat so we ordered:  - dozen charbroiled oysters ($25) - alligator meat tacos ($18)  The oysters are packed with butter and cheese so if you want less, let them know. We liked it but there is a lot of cheese. The alligator meat tacos were perfect!   The service was amazing, our waiter was so sweet and he couldn't be nicer. There was also an administrative staff member who came and talked to us and we liked how nice she was. We loved the Louisiana hospitality and would really consider moving here!   Dragos is a great restaurant and I recommend it highly!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

I ordered the three sampler with turkey, pork, and beef. It comes with corn bread which I love. I also ordered a side of mac and cheese which was delicious.

I decided to go with the ramen, to see if it was at all like the genuine article. I ordered the pork ramen, and my boyfriend got the miso ramen.   They both had chashu pork in them, and lovely opaque broth. The pork broth was a bit thin for my taste, and there wasn't a huge amount of flavor to it, but I absolutely loved the thick, slightly spicy taste of the miso ramen, so we actually switched bowls. I stole a bit of julienned ginger from the pork ramen, however, as it was an excellent touch.

"i'm finishing this review approximately 8  months after i started it.  while this could protray utter laziness on my part, it could also speak to how they've been etched in my mind.  here's what i remember:  i went to Meme two nights in row.  feeling a bit awkward, i admitted to the staff that i loved the place so much that i had to bring another group of friends to their magnificent happy hour. Meme's happy hour is great because of the quality of drinks they're serving at half price.  they rotate $5 wines, beers, and appetizers...and my friend, who is in the wine, cheese, and beer business, affirms their touting of sophisticated choices.  i remember that they're happy hour appetizers were solid.  i'm reviewing the etching in my mind, and i recall some sort of chorizo app.  which is always a winner with me.  while i'm the WORST at remembering facts, and things in the short-term, my taste bud memory is impeccible.  upon my next visit to Philadelphia, i will be stopping by Meme to ""check my facts"", so to speak.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"To start with I like Applebees. I really like the Oriental Chicken salad and the Bourbon Street steak. Tonight, though, we were not even given a chance to order. We were frowned at by the hostess because we said we'd prefer not to sit in the bar. She seated us at a table in an area with other patrons. After waiting for 20 minutes without any of the wait staff coming to our table I used the kiosk at the table to order a couple of drinks and an appetizer thinking that when they brought it to our table we could order our entrees then. 10 more minutes in a waiter stopped and checked the table next to us. I stopped him and asked if we had a server to which he replied as he reached for the kiosk, "" Did you use this to order?"" I said yes. And he replied, "" This is the wrong one for this table and the orders were going to a table on the other side and we were confused as to where they were coming from. I'll tell the server""  He sets the kiosk on the empty table across from us and leaves. 20 minutes later...no server...no drinks...no appetizer. We had now waited 50 minutes and fInally just got up and left...menus still on the table. I certainly would have understood waiting a while for our food as they were busy. But to not have been acknowledged at all except to be made to feel like we had erred in using the kiosk on our table was pretty disappointing.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I was looking for a place to grab a salad for dinner, and this came up on Door Dash. While not the worst salad, it certainty wasn't worth the $15 it cost. It was primarily lettuce, with one onion slice, separated into rings, maybe a tablespoon of feta, and a few olives, and a few slices from a tomato and a cucumber. This is what I envision lettuce farmers eat when times are tough. Who else would ration a single tomato, onion, and cucumber across ten to twenty salads? Granted now I know better to order a pizza, next time. Maybe, if I ordered in person, I would have known better. I think that's one of the issues of ordering on Door Dash instead of being present at a restaurant, it's hard to gauge the feel and expertise of a place by looking at a menu.

You can order a single patti (Little Burger) or the regular Hamburger, which is a double patti. Yes they are a little greasy, but that makes a good burger. If you are a health nut then this place is not for you; however, I enjoy a good burger once in a while. The fries are fresh cut and you can choose between cajun or regular. They give you a lot of fries! They have shelled peanuts to eat while you wait for your order. The prices are a little higher, but worth the extra buck or so than McDonald's or Jack n The Box.

There was two large parties at the same time we were there and it appeared only 4 waitresses to handle the entire restaurant. It took about 40 minutes to receive our meals. We would not see our waitress for 20 minutes and we needed  drink refills. Also they were out of the side vegetable that was supposed to come with one of our meals. She said she could substitute a baked potato. That would have been fine except that took another 20 minutes by which time our dinner was about finished. The grilled tuna salad I had was OK.

"We unexpectedly arrived into town at 8:00 AM and asked the hotel to hold our bags until 4PM check in.  The staff were so kind and as our room was ready, they let us check in early!  This was such a nice gesture for two weary travelers.    We received a room on the club level with an outstanding view of the arch.  The room was very clean but was musty as if the carpet was cleaned and never given a chance to fully dry.  Also the toilet was running and the only way to flush it was to take the top off the tank.  Those were the only two hiccups we experienced and we only stayed a night so I reported it to the staff in the AM.    We went up to 360, the rooftop bar, and didn't see the sign that said 'seat yourself' so we stood there awkwardly while no servers would make eye contact with us.  We eventually wandered out to the patio and found seats.  We enjoyed our drinks, but it took a while to get them, and the bar is full of people busy taking model shots and posing for instagram shots so we felt out of place as two forty-ish people who wanted to enjoy the view.  Unfortunately our visit was cut short when the rain started and we had to go inside. We finished our night at the other bar in the hotel and while service was slow, the drinks were fine.    Overall, this hotel fit our needs for a place to stay for a night before moving on, but we caught it on a night the Cardinals were out of town so it was very quiet.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 4.0
"This is definitely one of those reviews that I'm a little mixed on. On one hand, Whole Foods is awesome. They have great products and usually good availability as well as a lot of unique things and healthy choices, something I truly enjoy. On the other hand or service continues to get worse, and I'm just not sure that paying a premium is worth having to wait in line because they don't have enough employees to take care of the customers in front of them; there seems to be a high emphasis on online orders.   I stop by Whole Foods today, at 9 AM this morning to pick up a couple of things and a quick bite. 30 minutes later, I'm getting back into my car. It is ironic that I'm parked and literally the closest spot to the door, the first one passed the handicap stalls. I share this because within minutes I was able to walk into the store wander through and after about 8 to 10 minutes walked up to the register line. It was then the disappointments set in.   I was disappointed to see seven people standing in line in front of me, the only register open, which also just happen to be a 10 items or less line. I was also a little disappointed to see a couple of customers in front of me who appeared to have a basket full of groceries.   While standing in line my disappointment grew. I counted no less than 14 employees and proximity to where I stood and began to talk to the customer in front of me who to was disappointed with what we were seeing. Literally more than a dozen employees walking around filling carts with orders that have been placed online. There were employees stocking shelves and moving items out for customers to purchase. There was what appeared to be a manager and another person talking pointing and collaborating near where I was standing, and it all just seem to be an every day part of their business.  If you walk into the store to just pick up a couple of things, plan on standing in line while the primary focus is on online orders and people who are not even in the store.    I'm sure I will come back, but perhaps next time I will just place an online order because that seems to be where the priority is. It is just disappointing, if you were going to have an in person retail experience please have enough staff on hand to make sure that their needs are dressed as well. It is honestly a slap in the face when you have customers standing in front of you, cash in hand waiting to pay for the groceries on the priority is to run around and fill a cart to immediately take care of the needs of an online order.   In the end, it seems to me that if Whole Foods wants to charge more for the products that they have on the shelves that I can purchase from other stores than Whole Foods should give me more in the process. Sadly, if you were an in person customer you may just get less and still have to pay more.",Business Category: Grocery,Review Stars: 3.0

"Normally I always have something to complain about but when it comes to this little house I was actually impressed considering the many hands that dealt with me. The  dealership couldn't even do that on a sale and I was only renting from these guys, with no money exchanged! Unfortunately my baby got banged up real nice and it took 26 days to get fixed, yes I counted. Luckily for me the texting driver had insurance so they hooked up my rental whilst Kenzo was in the shop.     In 26 days I went through 4 cars....one stunk like cigarette smoke...exchanged for another one that had to be returned bc they sold it...to go to a car that is basically modeled after mine....to the last one that finally ended the tale. But each time I either had to go through Kevin, Chad, Ryan, Alphonso or the cool redhead guy that hops btwn this house and the Dunn Rd location, which SUCKS by the way. For some reason there is a lesser wait, easier transaction and more personable guys working at this little house than the bigger Enterprise on Dunn. Kevin hooked up my ride.

"Not that these guys need it, but I just wanted to take a moment to sing my high praises for this gem of a studio.   First of all, they take the pandemic very seriously - appointments must be booked in advance, and masks are required. No more than 5 people at a time allowed in the main room, and that includes the staff, so they truly stay away from overcrowding.   Now onto the good stuff. The entire experience was truly stellar from start to finish. EVERYONE on staff, from the front counter person, Scout; to one of the piercers, Zack; to my actual piercer, John - ALL of them are a fantastic, knowledgeable, and truly helpful bunch who want to make sure you walk out feeling like a million bucks.   I was there to get my first helix (pierced elsewhere, one month prior) replaced with proper jewelry (I had something less than ideal) and slightly stretched bc it was too small. Then I was adding a second helix below it.   Scout knew absolutely everything about the jewelry and helped me pick. Zack chimed in with advice as well. They recommended threadless, surgical-grade titanium jewelry for healing a new piercing, but they also had tons of beautiful options, also available in gold.  Onto the appointment itself: John, the head piercer, switched out my original helix earring with such deftness that I literally did not feel the sensation of the earring being inserted. SKILLS, my friends. Then he pierced my second helix, which involved super minimal pain, really a dream experience.   Kookie, one of the piercers from Inifinite's Baltimore location, was visiting as a guest piercer and joined John for my session. She also gave me helpful tips. The three of us hit it off and the entire appointment was full of sass and laughter. These people were so much fun it made you want to grab a bite with them after just to hang out.   Btw, their aftercare guide is a custom-printed booklet (not some generic printout) on beautiful, thick, magazine-quality paper. These guys take aftercare seriously, and they want to make sure that you do too.   I really wish I'd gotten my first cartilage piercing at Infinite - but at the same time, having gone somewhere that was a far cry from this experience made me appreciate Infinite's caliber of service even more.

"My fianc√© surprised me with reservations here for my birthday. I absolutely highly recommend this restaurant to everyone.  We started off with the dumpling sampler and the steamer edamame. Both dishes were flavorful and beyond excellent. We got 4 different types of dumplings and they came in twos. We also had a huge bowl of steamed edamame.   My fianc√© ordered the Angus Beef dish (the smaller portion). It was very big and full of flavor. I ordered the wasabi crusted filet. Both dishes were cooked to our specifications. We split the wasabi mashed potatoes, which were SO good.   Our server, Tom, was beyond exceptional. He was so knowledgable and helpful. He gave us excellent recommendations and service. He was so attentive. At the end of the meal he made sure to give me a little gift from there.   The restaurant itself is absolutely gorgeous. There is a huge Buddha on the one wall. I would HIGHLY recommend making a reservation as they do get busy.   Overall, this was one of the best meals I have had and cannot wait to go back at a later date.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"The gym itself has a decent amount of equipment for its size and if you go at the right time it can be like your own private facility. It's 24 hours and in a great, ideal location and always clean. The downside is their policy in regard to classes. For a gym of it's size with no specialty classes (Pilates, Zumba, trx) and only offers a minimal amount of other classes. If you enjoy classes this isn't the gym for you. Classes are cancelled more often than not due to a ""minimum sign up"" amount which is rarely met. On top of that, you need to sign up for classes online and if you can't babe it cancel within 12 hours. You also have to pay per class or buy packages (when there are only a few classes and they are always cancelled). Classes are a separate, extra fee that isn't included in membership. Management changes the policy often and it only benefits them finically further. They've lost many members because of this and they still do not adjust the policy.

"I'll give it 2, here's why:  I've only eaten once in a Korean BBQ (maybe Miga in another location?).  I expressed my naivety to the server and pointed at a few things on the menu but communication was unclear.  The end result was me kind of us saying you decide to the server, because he understood my lack of experience and I thought I could trust him.  Well it turns out that we received not only the thing I pointed at (a $60 plate for two which I really hadn't firmly ordered) but two other things as well.  There was so much food - way too much for just me and a petit female.  Seriously, four people could have eaten well with what was brought to our table - and the bill came to a whopping $110 for us - with no alcohol, btw.  In fact, as I recall, he didn't offer us tea or anything to drink (and it was cold out), just kind of plowed into the menu.  I feel gouged.  I usually check Yelp before checking out a new place, and last night regret not doing so because I see some other shady tactics in other reviews. The food was pretty good but certainly no outstanding.  The $60-dish-for-two was not very hot, and seemed to get cold fast.  And the way it was brought out was unclear - lots of lettuce and side dishes first, then a full ten minutes later with a big plate of meat.  It turns out that you wrap the meat in the lettuce and eat it that way, but we were halfway through these vegetable sides (wrapped in lettuce because we didn't know any better) before the meat came and we were advised that was to be eaten together.  I guess the proper way is to bring all at once rather than have us hungrily staring at plates not to be touched for ten minutes while the other component of the dish is being prepared.  I see absolutely no reason to ever go back to this place.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I've been to New Orleans many times before and recently took my girlfriend there for five days. I wanted her to experience the real thing when it comes to seeing and understanding the culture of New Orleans so I spent weeks researching the trip. Although I had stayed in the French Quarter before, it had always been in one of the better known hotels on Bourbon Street. I was very excited to find the Biscuit Palace website, which offered a virtual tour of some of their unusual and somewhat eccentric rooms. After speaking with the owner, Clayton, for some advice, I booked the Dauphine Suite. It was everything we imagined it would be, tastefully decorated, steeped with history and romance. Despite the fact it is only half a block off of Bourbon it's located towards the residential end of the Quarter and is remarkably quiet. The wrought iron enclosed balcony was a perfect place for cafe au lait in the morning and a cold Abita Turbodog in the evening. I wouldn't hesitate for a moment to stay there again.

"I'm pretty impressed with this place.  This is the kinda Mexican place that you go to when you're looking for authentic.  The food brought back memories of eating fresh Mexican food in Cabo San Lucas, it was that f**king good.    Restaurant, cleanliness, and staff were cool;i no complaints there. I had the chicken quesadilla and I think I'm going back again for dinner tonight. Also tried the steak burrito and it was delicious.  Their homemade salsas were on point and packed with lots of flavor.  Only thing that I think could be improved, is it they had freah horchata, (not the fountain crap) and BREAKFAST BURRITOS... Put breakfast burritos on your menu, and I'm sure to gain 20-30 lbs and it will all be worth it.   Update: this place did NOT give me diareah.. THANK YOU!!!

"Tiny place that is REALLY busy on the weekends. Small menu but good. Sell lots of rancheros and a quite a few crazy sugary breakfast items,  not too many healthy options. Attracts media hipsters for sure and parents with kids. The acoustics are a bit harsh and loud especially with screaming kids.   Great little place but a bit too crowded at times. Seem to cram as many people in as can even to the point that waitsaff cant get to you with food or for a refill without some gymnasics.  Food usually good but have gotten cold food a few tines. Can be a long wait to get in and a long wait for food. I dont like that they dont seat people who were there first because they might lose a seat at a table. If a party of two comes you could wait forever while someone who walks up with a party of 5 gets seated right away.  They will leave a table open to save it for a bigger check i guess..disappointing.  Really cute place but service can use some work.

She was apparently furious that we were leaving and even said that the time we had been waiting wasn't long enough and that the restaurant wasn't a McDonald's.

"A lot of improvement needed since re-opening this property.  Drive thru - The newest trend where they have two lanes converging into one when you go to pay and pick up your order, whoever thought of this new trend to implement is a fool and it only accomplishes making it appear the line is shorter then it is to generate extra customers and dollars.  Service - The most lackluster service asking for my order it literally sounded like the guy wanted to be put out of his misery from behind the speaker phone, not saying you have to love your job but maybe have a cup of coffee or something before you start your shift to enhance your mood just a bit?  Picking up of order - Very young lad asked me what size I ordered (Communication needs to be worked on as I had ordered a meal and not just a drink) Also a random person walked up in front of me to window to say they forgot his marinara sauce.  Food - Ordered large fries, definitely did not look like an ample portion and was seriously lacking flavor, I will chalk it up to fries not being salted properly. Fries are better at McDonald's IMO. Original Chicken Sandwich - not bad...love the loads of mayonnaise they slop on it definitely generates a yummly junk food taste. I did not see the International Chicken Sandwich listed on the drive thru board however and did not feel like slowing down the line as the international is my go to chicken sandwich.

"I was so disappointed with this place.. my friend recommended the Gluten-Free pancakes, saying they were delicious and fluffy- I was SO excited.  I came in and ordered, this was maybe around 11 AM on a weekday, so it was slow (maybe 5-6 other people). First off, the pancakes were over 13 dollars.... I was hesitant to pay so much, but my friend's recommendation made it sound worth it, so I forked over the cash. Then, it took ~25 to 30 minutes to get my order, and it was SO quiet in there, I have no idea how it could possibly take that long. Then, the pancakes were skimpy, flat and TINY. There were only 3 of them, and they were barely bigger than silver dollar pancakes from IHOP (and not even as good...).

"R&C's is a home cooking diner down in da Parish (Chalmette).  After a long chorus rehearsal, 10 of us stopped in to get some grub.  You peruse the menu on the wall, and then walk up to a counter and order your food.  The service was absolutely HORRENDOUS.  Someone would take an order for one person and then disappear.  We'd wait 10 minutes, then another person would reappear to take an order, then disappear. At 2 pm on a Saturday, with the lunch crowd already dissipated, it took about 20 minutes for 10 of us to even place our orders.  I also ordered an order to go, which I had to ask 3 separate people about...and then finally received...with the gravy missing.  Someone gave me the gravy to go with it as I was on my way out.  We finally received our food.  First off, the portion sizes are ridiculous.  It's hard to imagine anyone eating that much food.    I got the stuffed bell pepper, which was just o.k.  I also got the famous baked macaroni topped with brown gravy. It was very good.    A friend got fried eggplant with red gravy as a dip.  The red gravy was so tasty that it made me wish I had ordered spaghetti.  Prices are a little high for a plate lunch diner type of place.

In the meantime, it was 20 minutes later, my burger and fries are now COLD and the driver brings ""spicy"" mustard.

Speaking of plates, the walls are covered in oyster plates ... but they don't use those in service ... a shame really ... that would take the uniqueness factor up a notch or two.

It's $8.95, and you get 4 slightly-larger-than-normal pieces, but if I had known you're paying over $2 each for those, I wouldn't have ordered them.  This was my 2nd time visiting, and I thought I would give the Red Lion Soft Cheddar Burger (@ $8.95) a 2nd chance (I didn't like my 1st one and the reviews here made me want to try it again), thinking how much I like the soft cheddar burgers at placed like Fatted Calf and Trainwreck Saloon.  But this sandwich is a lot different and not one I'd prefer.  It's a tri-meat blend of beef, lamb, and I think pork.  It didn't seem to have much soft cheddar, it was a white cheese, and they usually serve it with onions, bacon, and BBQ sauce.  I asked for medium, and while the inside was medium-ish, the outside seemed a little too well done for medium.  The burger seems to be flavored with some kind of taco seasoning too that I noticed in the taste and in the way my burger dripped orange.  It was an odd mixture.  My 2 co-diners who also had the same sandwich said they wouldn't order it again.

"HOLY. CRAP. This is my favorite restaurant in Philly right now, I can't even think about this place without drooling and wondering when I can go back next.  I've gone with Korean friends on multiple occasions, and we've gotten all sorts of dishes...but my two favorites are Jeyuk Dubu Kimchi (pork and kimchi served on a hot plate, with tofu on top--friggin DELICIOUS), and Kalbi Jjim (kalbi soupy dish with the fat sweet potato noodles they use in japchae)--oh man I just couldn't get enough!!!  My friends and I were supposed to go back on Monday, and due to a conflict we didn't end up going--and I've basically been crying in a corner for several days and trying to find another time for us to go back.  MOAR KOREAN FOOD.  ALL THE KOREAN FOOD.  EDIT: plans were foiled YET AGAIN, which nearly ruined my life T___T ...luckily made it out there yesterday, and I am back to being happy :) Also, love this place so much that we actually booked a reservation for graduation weekend (with my part-Korean in-laws!)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Ive purchased a living room set, bed frame, and night stands from Ashley. Problems with everything. Night stand were delivered with imperfections. Bed frame was delivered with faulty parts.   Moving onto the living room set which was purchased on 10/18/2020. We were told we'd have the furniture by the end of the year due to covid delays. Mid-January rolls around and I had heard nothing. Called in and was told to expect a call on 1/27/21 to schedule delivery for about a week out. No call. I call on 1/28/21 to ask again and was told PARTIAL delivery will be on 2/8/21. 4 months delivery and 6 weeks after expectations.  Knowing how Ashley operates... they will do nothing to resolve the issue and continue business as usual. I advise you take your hard earned money elsewhere.....  Cont.

"My first time eating from here -- I ordered through DoorDash so This will strictly be about the food...   Which was EXCELLENT! I was having a greedy moment and ordered the classic bacon cheddar burger, sweet potato fries and buffalo chicken dip. The burger came with fries (which I didn't know and is why I order the sweet potato fries). It didn't come with a lot of fries though so I'm happy I did order the separate order of sweet potato fries.   I only sampled the buffalo chicken dip as I am stuffed -- but it is really good. It comes with tortilla chips. I can't wait to disgust and finish it up.   I will definitely choose to eat here again -- I'll probably even dine in. I ate it so fast I didn't even take a picture   UPDATE!   I've eaten here 2 times since my first time. Slowly becoming my favorite place!",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 5.0

"I had dinner here a few weeks ago on a girls weekend. This was the perfect pregame to a night of debauchery. I highly recommend making reservations which I'm thankful we did.  Our plan of attack was to establish a solid base for Bourbon St. drinking/debauchery. So we sampled a little bit of everything. Myself and a friend shared a dozen oysters on the half shell which were perfectly garnished, shucked and just the right size (that's what she said).   Next the four of us split fried eggplant fingers and shrimp remoulade. That remoulade still haunts my dreams. I wanted to dip my bread, my face, and my soul into it.  I got to try fried green tomatoes for the first time as they accompanied the heavenly remoulade and I must say, believe the hype.  For the main course, we decided to get one meal and split it 4 ways...conserving space for hurricanes, beers, and regret.  We shared a fried seafood platter, full of catfish, oysters and shrimp. This was my first experience with catfish, and I'm a big fan. Everything was perfectly fried, not overcooked or overbattered.  Of note, I sampled my friend's drink...the Frozen Bourbon Milk Punch.  I'm not a bourbon drinker, but that drink will definitely creep up on you.  Part of me wishes I imbibed, but mostly, I'm glad I elected for the Diet Cokes conserving quality space and liver usage for later in the evening/late morning.  Next time I'm in NOLA, I'm coming back for you shrimp remoulade. I love you.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"We have been going to this restaurant a couple times a year since it opened, and also to the owner's previous restaurant near 4th and  Market Street downtown. The food is consistently excellent. The menu reflects a French bistro style of food, with classic bistro dishes such as cassoulet as well as American entrees.  But the restaurant has a big problem in providing a consistent quality of service, a problem that we found with the previous restaurant as well. Our latest experience, Easter brunch this year with a party of five, was a disaster.    We were in the restaurant for 3 1/2 hours. Much of the time was spent waiting for something - for the waiter to show up and take drink orders (a half-hour wait after we were seated), for a chance to order a glass of wine with the meal (we had to ask four times for the wine menu) or for silverware ( at each course, the clueless waiter put plates of food in front of us without checking to make sure we had silverware, and then disappeared). My daughter had to leave to catch a train after two hours. She never received her first course ( a simple salad) and her main course (cassoulet) arrived 10 min. before she had to leave and she did not have time to finish it. The starter courses for two of the five people in our party never arrived.  I assume that the problem is that the restaurant has an uneven business volume and can't maintain a core of experienced waitstaff. It is in an out-of-the-way spot, on the top floor of a designer furniture showroom that is patronized mostly by architects and designers (the building empties out after business hours) in an area of town with little pedestrian traffic.  Readers can help the restaurant by patronizing it during weekdays and if they have the time for leisurely service they will be very pleased with the food. If the owners of the restaurant want to send out mass e-mails advertising Easter brunch ( as they did this year) they had better be prepared to offer quality service to the many people who show up.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Little Baby, I'm going to tell you what I really think of your ice cream. Flavor-by-flavor. Non-dairy only. Here goes:  * Banana Chip: Genius. Chocolate chips and fried banana chips? Heck yes! But it needs more banana in the base to offset that strong coconut taste. * Blueberry Lemonade: It's a sherbet! And a fine one at that! * Chipotle Chocolate: Excellent. Just the right amount of chipotle to make a pedestrian flavor interesting. * Chocolate Chocolate Cookie Dough: Perhaps a bit excessive. But that's the U.S. of A. for ya. * Chocolate Milano: I don't get it. Where are the crunchy wafers with the thin sliver of chocolate in the middle? Am I supposed to be in Milan? I was trying to get to Pepperidge Farm! * Chocolate Pomegranate Swirl: I went and looked up ""Whoa"" in the dictionary and this is what I got. * Chocolate Salt Malt: Just enough salt, but could use a little more malt. * Coconut Chai: Needs more chai. All I taste is the coconut. * Coconut Tea: Why are we doing this? For people who can't handle the excitement of chai or bergamot or something?  * Earl Grey Sriracha: I can barely taste either ingredient that this flavor has in its title. * Goldenberg Peanut Chews Vanilla Molasses: A Philly classic--Great flavor! And the molasses is so old-school that it tastes like new.  * Lime Toasted Coconut: Please give us more lime! And more toast! * Lychee Lemonade: It's another sherbet! And another fine one at that! * Mint Cookie: Classic mint chocolate cookies in a mint ice cream. Of course, the mint in the ice cream could be a little stronger... * Peppermint Hot Chocolate: Not quite sure why this is a seasonal flavor, or where the hot part comes in, but okay. sure. * Reanimator Coffee Red Eye: Strong stuff. Do not eat after 7pm unless you want to be up all night. * Smoked Cinnamon: Nice in a 2-scoop combo with Banana Chip or Chipotle Chocolate. Were I to make it, I'd add a pinch of chipotle into to the mix to make the smoky-spicy palette pop out more. * Speculoos: If I had a nickel for every time I heard someone ask what this is... * Strawberry Pinkpeppercorn: Pink pepper is such a great spice and they do it just right in this flavor, but this needs more strawberry. * Thai Iced Tea: Makes up for all of the places that only offer Thai tea with condensed milk, the coconut cream is a perfect fit for this flavor.  If the Little Baby changes a flavor, I'll adjust this review. And someone else can handle the dairy--Vegan is all I do.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I came to know Knapps several years ago when I was looking into bikes for my then 4 year old son.  Not only did we buy his bike there, but I also bought my current bike and the rack for our bike transport on our old Accord.  A few years and a new CR-V later, I went back to purchase another rack that would fit the upgraded.  When I purchased the Yakama racks, (One for bikes and another for ski's) the team at Knapps assembled it and took at least a half an hour going over the various parts to the rack.  When I got home, my husband and I tried to get the rack off the car, to be able to keep the car in the garage.  We were puzzled by one design feature of the rack.  So we called up Knapps.  Mark answered all of our questions, and stayed on the line as we described the problem.    In no time, with his guidance, we were able to get the rack off the car, and the car in the garage.  You can't beat the service at Knapps.  The bike repair team keeps us moving at fair prices.  We even had my son's Razor motorized scooter fixed at Knapps.

They had name brand toothpaste for complimentary which is good but the complementary razor was a cheap single blade which is not sufficient at all to shave with unless you shaving a 5 year old but  a 5 year old doesn't need to shave.  The decor is rather bland it wasn't dirty or anything just plain. It didn't have that funky motel scent  however they could have used some smell goods to freshen it up.

"I took the CCW class here a couple of weeks ago and thought it was good but could use a little more in one little area. I am an 8-year Army vet with a lot of experience as a weapons specialist (not to be confused with an armorer), Blackhawk Crew Chief/Door-gunner, Convoy security teams overseas, write freelance for gun magazines, Certified military rifle and tactics instructor, as well as being taught and mentored by some of the biggest names out there including people who built the custom weapons for SOCOM and by the man who preps sniper teams for the International Sniper Competition. So I have a lot of experience, although, it had been almost 6 month since I shot anything at all leading up to this class so I wasn't where I wanted to be. All that to say, I thought it was a pretty good class. You emphasized some things that I don't believe enough instructors emphasize enough - or at all. So that was really nice to see. However, I only really have one complaint about the class, and that's the ""I know more than you, so just believe what I say"" type comments to back the training you were giving. The best thing you can do as a leader and instructor is to provide purpose and reasoning to people. If someone does something, but they don't know WHY they are doing it that way, are we really helping them? How easy would it be then for them to change it up or do something different (wrong) when the reasoning and purpose behind it was never broken down for them? For example, going over form and a proper grip: Show them with a simple to follow explanation from both sides AND explain why they are holding it like that instead of the way they were taught 20,30, 40+ years ago and have used ever since then. Explain how it works compared to the older ones and some of the major flaws involved in the older holds. Then bring it together with how things change over time like form. Soldiers don't shoot today like they did in Vietnam - and for good reasons. It wasn't a good way to shoot a firearm. As I'm sure you are well aware, older retired veterans are the absolute hardest to teach because they don't like changing their ways from how the military taught them 40+ years ago, with what is now very outdated info. Basically, an explanation that is more than ""I trained SEALs, so just take my word for it"" should be used if at all possible. I am aware that you are also pressed for time on the one day class. Personally, I would give a short, expedited explanation and then tell them that they can get a much more elaborate and hands-on explanation and practice in your other, more in-depth classes. Then re-emphasize that the CCW class is NOT a proficiency class (like you already do). That's just a random idea so many or may not work. Just something I noticed while in the class since I heard the comments similar to those above several times throughout the class. Overall, I thought it was a good class and while I didn't totally agree with everything, I agreed with nearly all of it and was glad to see you bring up things that others are scared to. A real world fight isn't sunshine and rainbows and choreographed like the movies. It's incredibly chaotic. Thank you guys for your time and helping people learn.

"If I could give this place zero stars, I would.  It's one of the worst hotels I've ever experienced.  Here are the details. 1) They made us WAIT OVER AN HOUR after we arrived at 3pm which is the check in time.  They kept telling us the room would be ready soon so we didn't go anywhere else in the meantime - they basically wasted an hour of my life while violating the agreement that the room would be ready by 3pm.  They refused to comp us for this.  It was the least that they could do.  Pathetic.  Other people were also waiting a long time for their rooms.  2) We found a large black roach in the restroom.

"The lady in this place has been INCREDIBLY rude the TWO times we have been in here. This last time we ordered for pick up and immediately realized we ordered the wrong roll and immediately called to change the order. The lady said we had to change it through Grubhub since we went through yelp. I immediately hang up and call Grubhub. They text a confirmation with the price difference and change. Great... then I get an email saying the price difference is now $1 more all of a sudden. I text back Grubhub, they apologize and said it was the restaurant charging more for some reason and they re-adjust the price again to what it's suppose to be. Well we get the order only after the lady is INCREDIBLY RUDE... aaaaaand it's the first order that was wrong AND we got shorted on one of the rolls. Needless to say, we will not be back.

My experience was not horrible. I feel my experience possibly had more to do with being understaffed than anything else. We had a 30 minute wait. Not that bad. The wait for our food was exceptionally long. 45 minutes. My steak was served cold. My patatoes were burnt and dry. They couldn't manage to bring out mac and cheese and fruit for my son at the same time as our dinner. After an hour with no mac n cheese we decided it was time to get the check and leave.  15 minutes later we had to go boxes and a check. My husband had to take the check to the hostesses after another long period of waiting. I took my hungry and grumpy toddler to the truck and waited while my husband waited for the mac and cheese and finished up with the check...it took another 15-20 minutes. We're patient people for the most part but on this occasion the food was not worth the wait nor the high prices we paid. The staff was courteous but lacked in punctuality it seemed on this particular night. To their credit they were busy but if the restaraunt is built to accomodate a large crowd it certainly should be staffed for one on a Saturday night.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Oh man, this place made for a great late dinner. Smoked meats + amazing cheese biscuits = awesome.  We stopped in at about 9pm on a Friday night and our waiter wasn't too happy to see us. I guess that it was somewhat close to closing time (about 1.5 hours before), but he was very short with us during our whole visit. The food itself was pretty good. I got the pick two with pulled pork and hotlinks - both were excellent. Portion size was nice and matched the price. But my mistake was ordering their coleslaw as one of my sides. It was pretty underwhelming and really missed the mark. But otherwise it was a good meal and I was happy to have some yummy BBQ. 'Nuff said.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
While in town for Thanksgiving my boyfriend and I thought it would be nice to check out a recreational dispensary. Our home state doesn't have this option. Beyond Hello was a pleasant surprise. There was a line but it moved very quickly. They had an ATM on site which was very convenient. Inside was very clean. They had several attendants to assist in selections. They used iPads to help you browse their stock from their webpage. We could have placed an order to pickup but it made a huge difference having a live person to ask questions. The selection was plentiful. They filled the order quickly and the products were top notch. We can't wait for our next trip to Illinois.,Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 5.0
I came in for a simple gel pedicure and it was a disaster after actually looking at the finished product. Gel top coat pooled all over the cuticles of my toes and there is top coat I have to peel from my skin that the lady got all over me. I had to trim the gel top coat from the side of my cuticle and now there is a gap where the polish was sealed to my skin. Not only that but I paid $50.00 for messy sloppy work. Never coming back. The lady was nice but doesn't know how to apply gel polish what so ever. Not to mention they don't even use a proper foot file they use a cheese grater to remove calluses.,Business Category: Beauty & Spas,Review Stars: 1.0
"They do a lot right at Heidi's and I'll probably revise this to four stars after I eat there a few more times. I went there for an omelet today and the omelet kind of sucked, so I'm giving it three stars overall. I got a Florentine omelet and chose the blueberry muffin. The muffin was obviously freshly baked and was tender. I also liked the potatoes that came with the omelet. They were evenly cooked and nicely spiced. The omelet had problems. It came with a Hollandaise sauce. I'm all for different kinds of Hollandaise  sauce. it doesn't have to be generic. But there was something off about this sauce. It didn't seem like it was a spice. I can't put my finger on it. If I had to guess, I'd say it was old. It detracted from the experience. Another problem is that the omelet was supposed to come with bacon. Halfway through I realized I had not tasted any bacon yet. I flipped the omelet over and there were bacon bits at the end I hadn't reached yet. They seemed mighty chintzy with the bacon in this omelet. Service was good. I had all the coffee I needed. I like the place and I'll try other things on the menu. Just not the Florentine omelet again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Placed a request for 4 on the waitlist (via Yelp app) at 7:30pm. We were told to check in by 8:19pm and that we would be seated between 8:19 and 8:39.  On the way to the restaurant, our wait list time changed and we were told to check in at 8:46 (by this time it was too late to turn around because we were almost at the restaurant). We ended up not getting seated until close to 9:30. For a 2 hour wait, food was not anything spectacular.  My table got the following: Cobb salad, grilled cheese, ahi tuna, and the salmon.  Drinks were pretty good (sangria, orangecello martini, Manhattan, etc).  Waiter was very nice and attentive.  We got a margherita pizza to go.   If we were notified sooner that our wait time was going to be way longer, we wouldn't have gotten to the restaurant so early.  There were people tailgating with chairs and drinking on the lawn waiting for their table (pretty smart if you ask me!). I would recommend at least letting customers order drinks from the bar and drinking outside while waiting (I know a restaurant not too far that was allowing that).",Business Category: Bars,Review Stars: 2.0
"I've eaten here twice and loved it both times. The first time, we ate from the bar menu. The bartender was very attentive and gave great suggestions on food and wine pairings. The lamb burger was so moist and flavorful. The combo of bread, cheese, and onion with the lamb was amazing!  My second visit was in the dining room and was no less wonderful. The sweet breads and oyster salad are absolutely delicious! The barbecued lobster was also spectacular and just the right amount of punch so it didn't overpower the delicate lobster. I had the much touted about baby chicken and practically licked the plate. (okay, I actually did, a little. Ssshh...)  ;) My friend had the NY strip with asparagus paste. A bit too much with the asparagus paste... Definitely overpowered the meat which was sad because the steak would have actually been quite good alone. I also ordered a glass of wine that came out quite short of a full glass. The server even agreed and poured more in my glass. Not sure what that was about but at least she remedied it. To end, the deconstructed root beer float is so good I would go back just to satisfy a sweets craving. Yumm!

"So I walked in already wanting a bike. I had visited Cumberland Transit before, just looking around, you know. I knew they had good bikes and had been around for awhile. Every time I looked at my old, ratty, department store bike, I'd imagine how much cooler I'd look on a new one, probably one from Cumberland.  But walking in today, I tried not to get my hopes up. I started looking around again, telling myself I didn't have to buy anything today. Even though their prices were good. Even though they had some very tempting bikes.  Within a couple minutes, Keith the salesman walks up and asks what I'm looking for. I tell him, and he shows me a couple. He notices that I'm salivating over one, and lets me take it out back and squirrel around on it. He found the right size for me, and made sure it was what I was looking for.  You know where this is going. Right at the moment I was thinking ""man, I want to take this thing home,"" Keith smoothly asks, ""so, do you want to take this home today?""  A-yes please, and some accessories on the side. Best part, they took my old bike off my hands to donate to The Workshop Oasis, which builds bikes for kids.

"BED BUGS! I stayed at the Crowne Plaza for three nights on business (9/28/15 - 9/30/15). After the first night, I discovered 21 bites on my body - mostly in a cluster on my back and on my arms. I immediately went to the front desk, changed my room, and filed an incident report. The next day, I searched ""bed bugs"" for this location on Yelp, where I found an incident from two weeks prior to my stay where a woman experienced a similar bed bug incident in the same exact room! (Room 751). According to the review, although the woman and her boyfriend had posted pictures on Yelp of the actual bed bugs and had multiple bites all over their bodies, the ""incident report"" came back that there was nothing wrong with the room. I showed the front desk clerk the Yelp review and he said he was unaware of the previous incident and if there was something wrong with the room, it would have been resolved. Clearly, this was not the case. Just a couple days later, the hotel got this review deleted. Luckily I saved a screenshot on my phone.  A few days later, I received a phone call saying that the exterminator report came back negative and there was nothing she could do. The hotel's insurance company even had the nerve to suggest I could've had the bites before I came. Any normal person would be able to figure out that it is no coincidence that there were two bed bug incidents in the same exact room within a two-week time frame. The bites on my body were extremely itchy and uncomfortable for over a week, and I am disgusted that the Crowne Plaza refused to do anything to compensate me for my stay. I am currently in the process of dealing with corporate.  DO NOT STAY HERE!!",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 1.0
"Boy did I luck out. I moved in literally across the street from this place, within walking distance. I had gotten used to the one-size-fits-all utility Asian restaurants that ubiquitously dot the St. Petersburg sprawl. You know the kind, Thai-Hibatchi-Hunan Chinese and Sushi bar all in one. All of it edible, but most of it monotonous and boring and usually over-priced. Ya know, utility. Those are the kind of places that you go to when YOU want sushi, but you have fussy relatives that you unwillingly drag along that find raw fish ""icky"" and just want beef and broccoli, ""Hold the everything interesting"".  JYL on the other hand is a sushi bar. A real deal Sushi Bar. You sit across the bar from Itamae Lee, and you let him do his magic. They do one thing, and they do it good. You don't like it? You can go next door to the average Chinese place or the average pizza joint. I've honestly been looking for a place like this since I moved to Florida and I couldn't find it in populated and ""cultured"" St. Pete. A clean, quite, calm family owned place where a guy can get a Sapporo and order up some food from a chef that not only knows what he's doing, but cares about what he's making. A sushi place with an identity. No, it took me moving to suburban Riverview and going to the Chevron station in the kind of grimy strip mall across from my house to find it.

Um - I am a Norco oxygen customer - and you are making money from me monthly - that totally turned me off so I switched the service to another company.    They also don't have a contact phone number on any of their equipment so if you have an issue with something - you have to scour the book they give you and GUESS which place to call.

Cost me a little under $200 dollars.  I would have delivered the car myself however my vacation turned into two ER visits and 6 days sick in a hotel instead of at my families due to being contagious possibly. so she turned it in.  called maybe 5 minutes after delivering vehicle and spoke to andrew about the item being left. he said he would notify the employee who accepted vehicle and call the next day.  Never heard from him again.   after many many phone calls attempting to reach the Avis counter inside the Airport, we were finally informed that Andrew had a death in the family and would be out for some time.

"we stayed at the Hilton Garden in for 7 nights as part of an unfortunate trip to the Wills eye hospital to have a cancerous tumor treated and removed. We arrived scared and short on patience and sleep and the folks here at the hilton blew us away. From the cookies upon check-in to the free wi-fi it was clear from check-in that the staff aimed to please and in spite of the fact that we were far from home they did their best to make us feel comfortable and at ease. When my mom called multiple times for various issues with our room, a stuck thermostat, a room phone that woudn't call, engineers arrived promptly and had the problems fixed within the hour. I work in a chain hotel so I know the kind of commitment to customer service this takes when you're dealing with floors upon floors of complaining guests. The engineers were curteous and efficient. When I made it back to the hotel post surgery the following day, the kind and gregarious restaurant supervisor, Tom Bonfiglio broke open the kitchen to make me something to eat even though it was between meal periods. In the following days Danny and Chamran at the front desk were unfailingly polite in helping my mother get around the city while I was bedridden, and our cleaning lady stopped by daily, not only to replenish toiletries but to personally check that I was doing alright. We went down to breakfast the morning after my surgery where I was ran off by  some young children who were loudly pointing and staring at the large bandage over half my face. I left in tears to my room, all of which was noticed by our banquet server Eric. He had had limited interaction with us, just an ""would you like oj or coffee"" dialogue but it didn't stop him from buying me a get well card adressed to ""a strong woman""  which he hand delivered to our room after he didn't see me at breakfast the next morning. That card, signed simply ""your server Eric"" gave me more courage and comfort than half of the emails/cards/candy/and flowers I had gotten from friends and family back home. I was truly touched that he would go to such lengths for a mere stranger. As I read the negative reviews left by some of the other guests it seems they must've been in a completely different place. Sure my TV didn't have a hookup for my mom's ipad but the hotel was clean, efficient, professional, and filled at every corner with some of the most genuine caring individuals I have ever had the privilege of working with in the service industry.

"The main thing wrong with this small chain, for me, is the over-the-top hippie decor. There's a tie-dyed VW bus in the dining room, a ceiling-high mushroom just inside the door, and goofy cartoony pizza-re-themed paintings. I think kids enjoy it though, and it emphasizes the casual vibe in there.   They have a really nice selection of draft beer (8?), most of it from craft breweries. In Indy the local feature is Upland but different areas will have different selections. When we were there they had Guinness, Sam Adams, Upland Wheat, 2 different Bell's, Magic Hat #9, maybe Blue Moon, and at least one other.   Our server was nice, friendly, and quick. We had the meatball app to start. A slice of fresh mozzarella was the ""cream filling"" between each half of 3 good-sized meatballs, which were served lollipop style on a bed of tasty marinara, topped with fresh Parmesan curls and shreds of fresh basil. Yum! I would've preferred the meatballs slightly hotter-I think the cheese cooled them down some.   We decided to go with the 10"" Hot Potato Pie for $10.99. My partner usually doesn't want to try ""weirdly sauced"" pizza-any sauce that isn't tomato doesn't belong in his opinion, so it took some convincing. The pizza was fantastic! Mellow Mushroom uses a slightly sweet whole wheat dough-it walks the line between soft and chewy very well. Hot Potato Pie is garlic & olive oil, sliced potatoes, bacon, 2 kinds of cheese, onions, a little zesty ranch, a bit of sour cream on each slice, and a sprinkle of chives. You can watch the cooks hand-stretch the dough and actually see into most of the kitchen. The pizza was delicious and the toppings were applied with care evenly over the pie and none of his onions strayed over onto my half.   I recommend this place, either for families or adults dining without kids. If you don't want to sit around the noise of children, there is a well-separated bar area.",Business Category: Event Planning & Services,Review Stars: 4.0
"My husband and I recently went with our two younger children to see Trolls. This was our first experience here, and it was extremely dirty. So dirty that I had to leave because I couldn't take my kids getting on and off of the seats or touching anything. The concession stand was horrific with the floor being so sticky and dirty, that our shoes made a sound when walking. Everyone was nice, but they need to scrub that place down from head to toe and put a little effort in. I'm never going back there.

"This is the second time I have been to Bangkok Cafe and it was even better than the first time. My friend is the perfect dining partner because we order together and share. We began with what was called Thai Special Bread according to posters on the wall. Described as Thai bread topped with minced chicken and shrimp, it was more like a beautifully seasoned mix of chicken, shrimp, sesame seeds, and vegetable stuffed into little squares of bread and baked until crispy. A cucumber and carrot sweet dipping sauce perfected each bite. So yummy!  Our entrees were the Tom Kha hotpot with chicken at a #4 spice level, which is pretty spicy; but the coconut milk and lime leaves smooth out the flavors and balance the heat. The pot was filled with chicken, mushrooms, and onions in that luscious spicy-sweet broth We also shared the red curry shrimp and vegetables. The large shrimp were perfectly cooked, tails on, and the sauce was tasty. We would probably raise the spice level on that one next time, or try the green or yellow curry. We will order the Tom Kha exactly the same. No need to  mess with perfection!   The restaurant is nicely decorated with wood tables and patterned upholstered chairs. Cloth napkins and substantial flatware adorn each table. This is a fine dining atmosphere with prices well below what you might expect. Service was efficient and helpful. Oh, yeah... and the restrooms are immaculate and smell nice.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Let me start by saying how much I truly love this place. I've been going to the House of Tokyo since it first opened a little ways from where it stands now. The owners are extremely hospitable and care immensely about the food they present to their guests.  I've tried many different Japanese Steakhouses in my travels, and I've found that there is truly no place like home. They have highly skilled chefs, and the food cannot be compared with any other Japanese Steakhouse I've visited. Most importantly, they are consistent, clean, and reasonably priced.  You get about the same menu items as most of the usual JS's, but the sauces, dressing, and soup they have here are far and above the rest. I'm constantly searching, but I can't find ANY that are better than the House of Tokyo. It's simple, and the fresh flavors can speak for themselves.  I will always look forward to going to to the House of Tokyo, and I always have. They treat you like family there, and once you experience it, you'll compare everywhere else to it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Tucked in a small line of restaurants on Haverford Avenue in Ardmore, I had driven by this place many times and never even noticed it.  But, when I was looking for a great sushi place on the Mainline, I turned to Yelp for suggestions and am glad I did.  We have eaten at Harusame three times now, twice in the restaurant and once for take-out.  On all three occasions the sushi has been among the best I have had.  Tonight we started with an order of Edamame, then had American Dream Roll, California Roll, Tempura Roll, and Eel Roll. The American Dream Roll was my favorite, rock shrimp tempura inside, topped with king crab and crab sticks along with the chef's special sauce.  The meal was reasonably priced at $40 including tip. A few other details, parking on the street can be a little tight, but there is a parking lot for the train stop across the street and it being the weekend, we parked there.  The interior has an Asian vibe. There are lots of booths and some tables.  It's not super high-end, but comfortable and more than adequate. They also offer take-out a number of varieties of beer should you be in the neighborhood and need a six pack. The wait staff is attentive and friendly.  I look forward to going back and trying other items on the menu.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"The new owners have remodeled the existing restaurant and expanded the menu, with an emphasis on ""healthy Chinese food."" Many new dishes are available and there are lots of vegetarian options. The lunch specials are numerous, and many of them are vegetarian or come with ""vegetarian meat."" The ""tofu with black bean sauce"" was especially tasty, as was the hot and sour soup and the crab puffs that came with it. They have several dishes on the menu that you won't see at other Chinese restaurants, such as the ""Chinese Bread,""  which is similar to a beignet (you get four of them) that you dip in condensed milk.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Was looking forward to eating here as I love street tacos. However upon entering the restaurant I was greeted by a strong sour towel smell. My husband who'd been in the restaurant business for over 20 years felt it was sour mop - one that had been used in kitchen and then in the dining room. Which is a restaurant no no. Grease smell is awful and you can't get it out of your nose to enjoy the food. While the food was good, the service so so. And I hate seeing a table used to "" roll silverware "" in a prominent dining table.  Especially seeing the manager rolling silverware. At least have the hostess do it so she can stay up front. It was up front in the windows for passerby traffic to see. Not very classy.  And why is the hostess expediting food?   This restaurant has been open long enough to be operating better than this. Highly disappointed.  Experience doesn't match the decor.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"We came here last night for happy hour before dinner and boy those bartenders were not the friendliest. We had never been there before so had no idea what was on the happy hour menu. We got there 10 minutes before 6 PM. We waited for about 5 minutes until being acknowledged and when we were, we asked what was on the happy hour menu. The bartender snaps back we only have a few minutes left. So I ordered a grey goose drink which was $10 on happy hour! How the heck is that 50% off liquors for one drink??? I didn't like that there were no happy hour menus or prices. I felt like it was a rip off. We dealt with 2 other bartenders and they were rude as well. No smiles, no welcome, or have you been here before? Nothing. We won't be coming back to the bar at all.   Food - I got the Barbacoa tacos which were dry and had barely any meat in them. We also shared the shrimp and scallop appetizer, which was good but really watery which made it hard to eat. My friend got the pork chop and loved it. So maybe this is a spot where they only have certain good dishes and not everything is great.  Service - Our server was great, she was the best part of the night.   I did have a gift card from Open Table which they couldn't figure out how to use it even though it had instructions on the card how to enter it into their system so I didn't get to use that.   I would try this spot out again but not in the near future.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"It was my first time at Amici's, and was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews. I had ordered the Veal Marsala with mushrooms, and the sauce was thick and bland. It came with soup or salad, and bread which was fresh and hot. The soup was cream of mushroom, and just like the veal sauce, it had too much thickener. The dipping sauce was bland with only olive oil, and very few spices; very disappointing. The entree came with pasta, and I'm surprised that the waiter did not come over to offer fresh pepper and grated Parmesan as this is the norm at the Italian restaurants I've frequented. I don't fault the waiter as he was working many tables and it seemed like they were understaffed this Saturday evening. I had ordered the calimary as an appetizer, and the portion was extremely small. The prices were average considering the quality of the meal you were getting. Everything had tasted bland, and nothing stood out as a winner. The owners are from the east coast so I has expected a much better meal, and service. When I made my reservation, and when I arrived, I stated that this was my first time at their restaurant. It would have been a nice gesture if the owner could have welcomed us or checked if we enjoyed our food; however they were nowhere in sight during the entire meal, and when we were leaving. Maybe they thought that we were tourists never to return again. However, they missed out as we are residents for the past three years, and we will not be recommending there restaurant to our friends. The meal, service, and management nonchalant attitude is a definite turn-off.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Quarantine Post  They have limited seating but hot pot is alive again! First impression, the food is extremely high quality and their fish balls are homemade as well as noodles. They are going for the niche and quality food. They also have a promotion of buy 1 get 1 for select meat orders, a la carte. Honest, the homemade colorful noodles are pretty but impossible to eat. Very chewy regardless of how long you cook it. The fish balls are a MUST try, very delicious, we got the combo first and then ordered separately. The food selection is plentiful and our party of 5 had a wonderful time. They also have multiple different soup bases with individual pots. They sent us a sauce tray, the options were very dry not very sauce like however, they have a homemade sauce thats delicious!

"Hello yelpers, its the F5 hear with this weeks review!   I have been to many restaurants but its rare for one to truly shine like Veekoo Asian Cuisine in Royersford, Pennsylvania. As soon as I walked in I was completely amazed by the beautiful and classy d√©cor that had truly romantic atmosphere with its lighting and music that truly sets the mood for any occasion. But it takes more then just ambiance to win me over, for truly the restaurant can only be as strong as the service. The wait staff was extremely focused, friendly, and had consistent and well executed timing. Even the bussers were fast, efficient, and kept every detail up to expectation. While these are quite impressive details about this restaurant, the true key to its success is its outstanding food. Of course you cant have a nice dinner without a beverage. I chose to have a nice hot cup of green tea, but what I got was truly surprising. Most of the time for Chinese and Japanese restaurants they will give you a cup of tea strait from a tea bag. But not Veekoo, instead they gave out a teapot with green tea brewed from organic green tea leaves. I wasn't expecting much from a beverage, but if they put this much effort into a drink I couldn't imagine what was in store for me for the actual meal. I ordered for starters a dim sum sampler which included a veggie dumpling, a shrimp dumpling, a pork dumpling, a crab rangoon, and an eggroll. It came out at a spectacular pace but if it takes a little longer there is nuts and pickled cabbage. The flavors of each dumpling was simply amazing but the true star of this dish for me was the eggroll. For someone who doesn't like eggrolls they truly surprised me with a perfect crunch and delicious flavors. Its no question that I will be coming back for more of there amazing eggrolls. To think that it was only the beginning of this amazing dinner I moved onto the next course, a beautiful sushi roll known as the fancy dragon. I have always been a fan of sushi ever since I was little, but this roll was something that took my expectations of sushi to a whole new level. Before you eat with your mouth you always eat with your eyes. For me it was a pure example of art in the shape of food. The role featured beautiful coloration with the bright greens of avocado, bright orange coloration of the masago, and the gentle pink of the smoke salmon. But the taste was truly something to savor for its smoky taste of the smoke salmon and the cooked unagi (eel). To add more to the flavor they add a tangy eel sauce to the role that elevates things to a new level of flavors. the texture was a mix of crunchy from the shrimp tempura to a smooth silk like texture of the avocado and salmon.  But after eating this amazing meal one thing really caught my eye, people can enjoy these amazing flavors at home with there take out. Most of the time when I get Chinese take out its ok but nothing really screams amazing at me at its flavors or textures. But Veekoo not only set a new bar for a dinning experience but also set a new bar for take out. For this reason and many others this restaurant gets a solid F5, meaning that it has met the true peak of my standards and have truly gone beyond what I would have expected. In my opinion this amazing restaurant takes the top of the list in my top favorite restaurants and I will definitely be coming back for more. If the owners of Veekoo see this I want to thank them for such an amazing dinning experience. This has been the F5 thanking you for taking the time to read this review and have a nice day!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

Not one person could finish their serving of what turned out to be the worst strawberry rhubarb pie any of had ever had.  To add to the tragedy my sister had paid $18 for the travesty.

"Harrahs is one of those original Reno hot spots from decades ago. Hubby and I wanted a romantic night out. BIG MISTAKE! Gone are the days of a warm welcome back. Instead we were assaulted by airport kiosk check in terminals. And... had to wait in line anyway, to check in. Plus, so unsightly. If you're removing the human check in, remove it! They just slapped those kiosks in front of the check in desk. UGLY. What amateur thought that was a good idea?  At first glance we were delighted to see our room. We had a balcony! We said, ""oooh, let's go downstairs and get a couple glasses of wine to enjoy the fresh air and the view"". The sliding door was broken It would have been nice to escape the cigarette smoke for a bit. Why these Casino hotels aren't able to use a separate air filtration system from the casino is beyond me.   So, in lieu of a view, how about a little Telly? Yeah! No.  Since the remote was broken. We knew calling the front desk for a replacement wasn't an option. Why? Because prior, at check in, I spilt sauce (doggie bag) near the check in and I just couldn't get janitorial to show. I stood at that spot forever so nobody crushed their spine on my spill. They never showed. The Bell Capt threw a towel over the mess. If they don't care about spills in the lobby I doubt a broke tv remote is high on their list.   Last option, a hot bath. Kudos for having a tub. Most places don't anymore. Terrific water pressure and HOT! Downside, mildew! Ewwwww Second, mystery stains on the wall paper. Dead lightbulbs, duct tape holding wall paper to the wall, torn upholstery.

"I've been told about this place by a friend that frequents it.  It certainly seems like a regular hang with a slightly older crowd than some of the other places I frequent.  The service the night I went was fantastic.  The waitress checked on us quite a few times, and my friends' beverages were replaced before they were even empty.  I ordered the taco salad, which came with in a bowl made from a tomato based tortilla.  It was good enough but nothing special.  Their menu isn't huge which can sometimes be a relief but it was very basic in variety and I just prefer a little more for my taste buds than typical comfort food. I did enjoy the music being played, which wasn't very loud and there were families and friends alike enjoying their dinners along with a few kids.  It's a smallish location but does provide plenty of parking.  I can't say that it was a place I will end up seeking out again, unless it is to enjoy an adult beverage on a hot summer day on their patio.

I ended up spending $70 at the airport for my flight on top of my $50 plane ticket, which evens out at a normal rate. Not to mention the plane is small, not a very smooth ride and there are no TVs- although I can live with all of that.

"Had higher hopes for this place, but all around was OKAY.  Went on Sunday for brunch.  Upon first walking in, the hostess seemed stand-offish and didn't really talk much and acted surprised that we were there.  There weren't man people in the place and the waiters were just standing around waiting for something to do.  Our waiter was friendly though, and asked if we had any questions, so I asked if there were any brunch specials.  He said, ""no what we have is on the menu"".  I was surprised by this, as I find that most , if not all, places I have gone to for brunch in the past 2 years have pretty sweet brunch specials on the weekends.    We ordered the apple fritters, which are fried dough with apple cinnamon coating accompanied by a sweet mascarpone cream dipping sauce.  These were awesome, and a nice sweet starter to our brunch.  Also had coffee, which was good, probably La Colombe, however the mugs they serve them in are very wide so the coffee doesn't stay hot for too long.  Our food came out quick - I ordered some dish with sausage gravy and biscuits with fried eggs.  My girlfriend ordered poached eggs and hashbrowns with some other small fixings mixed in.  Immediately upon receiving the plates I said to myself in my head, ""Okay, this is totally cliche artsy square plates with barely any food on them but it's HIP.""  I was kind of hoping for a more hearty, heaping pile of food than what I asked for, but it was tasty nonetheless.  I hadn't had biscuits and gravy in a long time, and I was pretty satisfied.  The biscuits could have been a little softer, but altogether the food tasted well together.  My girlfriend was pretty satisfied with her dish, but liked mine better.  It was decently priced, a bit expensive, but nothing outrageous.  Overall, this place was OK.  Nothing really wrong, but nothing stood out either.  I saw the dinner menu, and it looked pretty tempting, so I might have to check them out again one night.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Let me start by saying that I explicitly chose this hotel because of the beachfront access, full kitchen, and the low number of floors because I am just over a month from a full hip replacement.  We are celebrating our 20th (actually 21st) anniversary, as we could not last year. Although the full kitchens are across the street and it is a pain, the room and the accommodations are nice and well kept.  As we were leaving the beach with all chairs and the supplies that we need to bring back to our room across the street, my wife left ahead of me to get a cart.  When you leave the perimeter of the pool and beach area there is a locked gate that leads to the main office area. As she walked out and the gate closed behind her, she saw that there was no cart available and she realized she did not have her key.  When my wife went in the office, the attendant who later stated his name was Gary was on the phone.  After waiting for a conversation break, she asked if he could please open the gate, he became agitated and started to yell at her that she was interrupting him and she can't get in without her key!  She stated that I had the key, and was still stuck at the beach and needed to get back to help me even though there was no cart available, but he was insistent that she should have her own key and refused to open the gate.  When I finally got tired of waiting an lugged up all of our stuff to the front, I heard a commotion and the attendant loudly state ""This is the guy who can't walk? I asked what was going on? He stated that she was ignorant and interrupted him on a phone conversation and did not have a key. He said to pack up our stuff because we were kicked out.  I asked if he had the authority to evict us and for what reason? He stated that he was calling the police because she interrupted him ignorantly. I instructed him to call the police and asked if I could have the number to his manager, to which he refused.  Needless to say, the police never arrived and we are still here, however, both of us are extremely disappointed and are looking for some answers?

"Stayed here for a girls' volleyball tournament in late June '10 and the stay was passable.  Check-in is a nightmare. For some reason, they won't check you in early, even if they have a room available. No, you have to wait for 3pm. At around 2pm, the queue started to build, so I got on line. The guest in front of me was rather loud and abusive about having to wait another hour, so I'll thank him for having the staff open up check-in at around 2:30. Later in the week, i saw the line build to about an hour long. Not a great way to start off one's trip.  The room was clean but outdated. I saw I sign that they were re-doing the rooms this summer (doesn't help me now). Maid service was spotty. I asked one night for clean sheets and I got them, but none of them were tucked in.   Views are really nice. We were on the city side, and we got some of the lights at night as well as the mountains in the day.   The hotel staff was either really, really nice and accommodating or really surly. There was no in between.  My first two days I used the fairly well appointed exercise equipment and thought, this is pretty nice. On day three as I picked up a towel to begin working out, I was told that it was an $8 per day charge to use the equipment....huh?  I explained that it was free the previous 2 days but I couldn't convince the staff. I stayed away from this the rest of the 6 days I was there.   The hotel nickels and dimes guests like this to no end. There is no free wi-fi or free business center where you can check e-mail or even print a boarding pass. It's a charge to go online, and $2 more to print a boarding pass. You can't get any cell reception (at least through Verizon) in the spacious lobby. I had to make a call from the parking garage.

"I really want to like this restaurant and resisted writing a bad review after my first visit thinking it was just what I had ordered, but after being served cold, terrible dishes on two separate occasions, I can adequately convey an accurate review.  The service is very good at the restaurant, and the d√©cor is nice and the place is clean.  I have tried several appetizers and they are fairly descent.  The spring rolls, dumplings, and the two soups my wife tried were very good, as was my miso soup.  The problem is in the entrees.  I have tried the pad thai and the curry chicken and both were terrible and cold.  The curry chicken consisted of two plan chicken breasts with some curry sauce poured over top, it had little flavor and was cold.  My daughter got chicken teriyaki, and it was the same bland chicken breasts with teriyaki sauce poured over it that tasted like something out of a jar only worse.  My wife got rolls on both of our visits and liked both of them, but I cannot attest to this as sushi is not my thing.  The first sign of trouble at Kyoto is the menu.  For those not eating sushi, there are way too many entrees, which usually means they cannot be making all of those dishes fresh or well, and that is definitely what I found.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

I will be honest about this business. My husband and I first started going here because we got a real good deal on groupon. The owner John is a sweetheart and really made me feel welcome. The first massage was a full body for an hour and very thorough and professional. I felt sorry for him because the building he was renting had leaky pipes and as a result he had water damage many times that left the carpet wet and a dank smell. Then it caused a fire and he had to relocate. But we had more than a handful of good experiences there and are waiting to go to the new location as soon as he gets his license. I would recommend this business to others because they give great massages and John is a people person.

"This is one of the best studios in the tristate area.   Where to start?   I have always wanted to get a tattoo. I am an artist and a lover of the arts, so it makes sense,  but I never took the jump until I met Sean Duffy at Phenom-A-Bomb. For two years, I researched different artists and looked all over the country, but I never got the inviting vibe that I was looking for from any of those talented folks I bookmarked. And then the strangest thing happened: I ran into an old elemetary school acquiantance at a bar who had a simply gorgeous art piece on his shoulder. It was creative, colorful, had impressive depth and lighting, the shading was highly skilled, and looked like it was designed FOR the actual body part it was on. I had to know who had done it, and was directed to Sean.   After checking out all of his work and thinking on it for a couple weeks, I decided to make the leap. Even after setting up my consultation I still felt anxious about the experience, but any fears I had about the experience or the end product diminished in about 30 seconds of meeting him.  Right off the bat, he was well spoken, personable, and extremely friendly. He loved my idea, and was very excited to work with me. During our first consultation, I showed him the design elements I picked out and he was already spitting out dozens of intriguing ideas and details that really blended everything together. I was still slightly neurotic about the final design because I had trouble visualizing what he end product would look like. That brings me to an important point about working with him and any other creative artist: if you really want to make the best of your time and money, you need to give him or her creative license.   Why? You can go just about anywhere to get your compass star or koi fish (and no disrespect if that's what you want!), but if you want the best looking piece possible, you need to give your artist freedom to do their thing. The drawing process is very organic, and imposing too much control over that process and cramp an artist's style. I'm not telling you to dump your ideas and let people doodle whatever they want into your arm, but you should be prepared to let the tattoo evolve as the process goes on. Some of the ideas you thought would look badass just won't translate over well to the body part.   So what do you do? Do you find someone who will plop whatever you want wherever you want? In my opinion that is not the point of ""body art."" If the piece does not complement the body and soul of the person wearing it, you just have a symbol embedded on you. Again, fine if that's what you want, but if you're as picky as I am then that's not gonna fly.   That being said, Mr. Duffy has no ego and will not try to push you in a direction that doesn't work with your own philosophy. He will, however, give you honest feedback and suggestions. And if you don't like his design, he will start from scratch for free, and you aren't getting billed for the hours it takes to do that. It's a pretty damned good deal if you ask me.   Onto the actual day of the first sitting, which totalled five hours, I don't think the process could have gone any smoother. The studio is bright, beautiful, and clean. He will show you all of his tools and explain how they work if you're curious, even going into the hygenic process that the studio uses to make sure everything is sterilized and clean. He's got a huge cabinet full of blu rays if you want to chill, but I like to yak so we talked the whole time (with It's always sunny providing occasional laughs).   As for the process itself, if you've had work done before then you probably know what to expect. I can honestly as that through the entire five hours, only a couple moments of actual pain occurred. The rest is pretty reasonable (no worse than sunburn). I only bled from one tricky area that had a lot of detail. One of the biggest skills a tattoo artist needs is a feel for the correct depth of the needle in the skin. Too deep and you hit muscle, too shallow and your ink doesn't fully take. It's a sweet spot, and one you need to reach if you want to keep that color looking bright for years to come. That's something that only experience can teach, and he's been doing this for 15 years now.  The first session was last month, and it's fully healed now, looking as bright and beautiful as it did the day it was done. I get complimented randomly everywhere I go now, and everyone wants to know where it was done.   I can't wait to go back tomorrow and get back on that chair.   I will be uploading photos to this review when the half sleeve is finished in November.  A note on the other artists: Tara, his wife, is extremely talented, but I have not had the pleasure of talking to her for more than a couple minutes. All of the artists there are highly skilled and up to snuff.

"Absolutely had a blast at this place! Ok I'm from New Jersey - a long way from home and have never been to New Orleans so of course we had to go to Bourbon street. It was pretty much what I expected, although not near as wild as I had heard. But I do think it was pretty much off season, I think spring is the more crazy time to come. That was fine with me. It was myself, my 76 year old mother (who acts 25) and my two twenty-something sons. We all had a great time at this place!  I've been to Vegas many times, Key West, and everywhere in between - and this placed ranked with one of the funnest (bar-type) places I've gone for people any age over 21. It's all ages and it's just plain fun!! The entertainers/DJs/emcees are good talent, full of energy and enthusiastic!! They make this place! I hope they are getting paid as much as they put into it and deserve! They are nonstop the entire time you are there and they keep the crowd going no matter how good or bad the karaoke is.  The place gets pretty crowded. We had so much fun there we went Saturday and Sunday. Drinks are 3 for 1 until 8 pm and then they are regular price, which of course isn't cheap. A couple of waitresses go around selling Jell-O shots which I love! As someone else said in their review, I wish the DJs didn't do their own singing quite as much, but I do understand that they help to keep the crowd fired up. Just think they should do a few more karaokes in between. Definitely a must if you like to have a good time! FYI--it is a dive but so is every other place on Bourbon street.

Tasted like a mix of Velveeta and other cheeses, with a creamy consistency to it. I liked it, but I did hit a limit! (=  I think you need to try it once and make your own opinion.

"The single worst experience that someone can have. It has taken 4 visits to get the correct prescription for contacts. Literally the most rude staff and doctor.  I have literally never met a worse medical professional.  I guess we should have read the other reviewers. Our experience was very, very similar.  He pushed dailies on my wife.  One of the daily lenses tore and she had a piece of it stuck in her eye for two hours. We thought we would have to go to the emergency room because we couldn't get it out and it was extremely painful for her.   No apology from Dr. Schwer. He just keeps on pushin' the dailies and still try to bully her into stopping using the lenses that have worked for her for more than a decade.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 1.0

"As a tourist to Philly, we stopped someone on the street and asked where we should go to get an authentic taste of the Philadelphia iconic sandwich and we were lead here and we weren't disappointed.  I ordered a cheesesteak with provolone and sweet peppers and it comes out loaded with hashed ribeye bits, gooey cheese, onions and peppers on a super soft yet crisp torpedo roll. I think the meat is a bit underseasoned but you can add some salt and some hot sauce to fix that up easily. The fries here are SUPER awesome too. They taste like potato, fried to a crisp - crisper than your best fresh McDonald's fries level crisp. It's quite an achievement to get that nice a texture on your spuds.  The part of town this is in though, not sure I'd come back around as it's not my kind of place but if I was around for some reason, I'd stop by again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I'll give this place a start just because the service wast a complete let down. Let me start by saying that I love pizza, all kinds of pizza. And the one thing I hate seeing on my pizza is black. We came here on a Tuesday so it wasn't busy at all and our server was pretty good. What I don't understand is how in the world they would send out an undercooked pizza (I mean the cheese was not melted yet and the bottom was burned to the max.). They started pushing the wine list to us like it was their staple and not the pizza. I asked if they had calamari but the server said they had no stove so they don't cook anything yet they had pasta hmmmm. We ordered a large pizza with toppings of meatball on one side and grilled chicken on the other half. It didn't take long for the pizza to be done and I was highly surprised considering they use a brick oven but yet it did. So as we were eating I noticed my fingers starting to turn black and then I realized that the whole bottom of the pizza were burnt. The cheese itself also wasnt melted gooey like you would expected if fully cooked. The grilled chicken also tagged like it came out of a Tyson bag and just threw in as a topping. I would've said something to the server but my complaint list even to me felt like nothing was right. After the dinner we were offered if we would like dessert but we felt like we tried enough to know to call it a day at this establishment. Maybe I just expected more out of this place considering the place had a big sign that food network rated them highly that it never lived up to it on our visit. Over all not the worst experience but will not be coming back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

We never felt rushed, and Chuck took great care of us. Most of us had salads to start...delicious. The dressing on the house salad is soooo good. Menu is big with a huge list of appetizers and rich Italian entrees. Seared scallops was about the healthiest option, as well as the salmon special. Both were sampled T our tables along w/the mussels & fries, gnocchi and various pastas with rich sauces. Everyone LOVED their dinners. Drinks were fairly priced. Cozy atmosphere. Very tiny.

I enjoyed the shrimp tacos, but they definitely had some heat from the chipotle sauce, so be warned if that's not your thing.

"We had a couple visiting us from Texas so we were doing tourist things.  I was expecting a boat full of 75 year olds but i was wrong.  There were people of all ages, couples, and familys.  When we entered the boat we had to ask to sit next to our friends.  They made it happen.  If you buy tickets seprately with someone make sure you let them know you want to sit together before you arrive.  Dinner starts as soon as you board.  Get your food quick because the line stays pretty long and you want to have time to drink.  I tried all the food.  The soup and salad were good.  The bread rolls were soft and fresh.   They had rice pilaf, veggies, salmon, chicken marsala, and a beef dish. My favorite was the beef.  Very tender and delicious.  Dessert was cheescake or a banana chocolate cake.  We shared a cheescake.   Our sever was bringing us drinks while we ate. Very good service on the boat.  After we ate we went up stairs and started ordering drinks at the bar.  The second floor has a dance floor and a bar.  Drinks were good and its all you can drink.  You can go outside on the front and back of the boat and also on a third level that is outside as well.   We saw an amazing sunset that night.   My only complaint is that its only 2 hours.   Would be cool to have another 30 minutes or so. We didnt want to get off the boat.  We had an awesome time and so did our friends.  Its definetely a great deal.   Boat ride, dinner, and drinks for like $65.

"Since the re-branding and change in ownership, this place has become my new favorite place for gel manicures and relaxing pedicures. The decor looks similar inside, but the staff is entirely different and the entire experience is much better.   Case in point: my most recent gel mani lasted a full 3 weeks with no chips or peeling. I don't know how they do it, but I have never had one stay on for that long.   Best changes to date:  1. The prices have dropped from what they were under the past owners. A gel mani is $30, and I remember paying almost $10 more in the last.   2. Complimentary neck/shoulder massages!   3. The staff is faster and friendlier.   4.

Both were excellent, the fish was very fresh and worked well with the watermelon. For main plates had the classic rack of lamb which was delicious, also had the duck breast over black rice.

"You are probably eating a cheesesteak at By George because you are at the Reading Market and the line for a Carmen's cheesesteak is already 50 deep and you are not about waiting for 30 minutes or more for a sandwich.  We had a Carmen's cheesesteak over the summer and I am a bit perplexed by its popularity. Perhaps its the location ... front and center of the market in the highest traffic spot ... which makes it so popular. After all, would dozens of people really line up if it wasn't worth the wait? Or so the thought goes. If there is a line, it must be good. (We found Carmen's to be an average cheesesteak ... however did not try their specialty, The Franklin, which is famously made with cream cheese, sauteed onions and cheese whiz.)  The line at By George was only 4 people deep. It felt less like ""the soup nazi"" when ordering and I will verify the rumor that these do in fact seem to be the largest cheesesteaks in Reading Market. The sandwich is huge and stuffed with meat. We actually probably would have split one if we knew the size ahead of time.  At $12, it wasn't a terribly expensive sandwich. Not cheap but I think for the size, a fair price. The biggest problem I had with it was the sesame seed bun which had sort of a burnt-ish taste due to the sesame seeds. I'd much prefer a regular old white hoagie roll which didn't overpower the sandwich the way that the sesame seed bun did.  The other issue I had was the opposite of the overpowering bun. The meat was bland. Under seasoned ... with no salt and pepper in the bag, the sandwich meat didn't shine. It didn't have that meaty salty flavor. And the American Cheese they used turned into a white liquid which dripped from the sandwich into an opaque river. It wasn't gooey and melty. More like liquified.  I wasn't a fan at all of the red peppers which added a sweet note and there were very few mushrooms or onions in the sandwich. It was mostly bland meat and liquidy cheese.  Would I go back to By George? Probably if I was hungry and wanted the biggest portion of cheesesteak. I'd get the provolone cheese next time and make sure to thoroughly salt and pepper the sandwich. Would I take a first time visitor to Philly here for their first cheesesteak experience? No.  I have a few other spots to try cheesesteaks at. I've done Pat's, Gino's, Carmens. Next up is Campos (outside the market) or one of the others inside the market ... one started with the letter S and promised the greasiest cheesesteak in the market. When it comes to cheesesteaks ... can you really go wrong though?",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

He made a point to say hi to the couple at the other end. Take drink orders from others who approached the bar. But never, not once even looked in my direction, even though I was right in front of him! Certainly I could have spoken up, and I may have had time for another beer (and tip you! because that's how we make our money, right?), but the cold shoulder really kind of put me off so I chose to move along.

"I returned to Szechuan House, the hidden treasure of a restaurant found on Rt. 33 in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey, for another mouth numbing meal last week.  The last time I was there I underwent a root canal the next day without need of additional anesthesia.  It was that good!   Yes. This is a joke, but you might not think it funny if you don't take the warning seriously. If you are thinking ""Mexican"" spicy, you are in for a rude awakening.  Szechuan spicy is an entirely different dimension of heat.  I love Jalapenos and Habaneros, and even Ghost Peppers, and you can pile them onto my Flautas without me blinking.  Put an equivalent amount of Szechuan peppercorns, hot chili oil, and those cute little red Chinese peppers into a dish, and your review goes from 5 Star to 5 Alarm.    I love it, but it is an acquired taste. As someone said about this style food, ""Numb is a flavor.""   Last week, I was surrounded by Dan Dan Noodles with Minced Pork and Chili Vinaigrette, Steamed Dumplings with Chili Vinaigrette, Amazing Eggplant (that's the name), and Hunan Beef.    The Dan Dan's were spaghetti diameter, and had a nice ground pork sauce with a mild spicy quotient.  Very tasty and a nice start to the meal. (4 Star/3 Alarm)  The Steamed Dumplings with Chili Vinaigrette was found in the Szechuan Delicacies part of the menu toward the back page.  Six fairly large, hand stuffed and pinched, with the red chili oil and vinegar for a bath. There was a pleasant sweetness that I experienced before the heat arrived. Not sure how that was done, but it played well on my tongue. (5 Star/4 Alarm)  The Amazing Eggplant came on a large plate piled with the thin Chinese Eggplant, in a brown, spicy sauce with a light meat base.  This was delicious and stole the show. Tender, medium heat, and addictive. (5 Star/3 Alarm)  Hunan Beef came with an equal supply of broccoli in a shining brown Hunanese sauce.  The beef was thin sliced and very tender.  The Chinese chilies swam in the sauce at the bottom of the serving bowl.  Solid choice, if not completely inspiring. (4 Star/ 3 Alarm).  This was a totally satisfying meal, reminding me of my Chengdu daze.  The 5 Alarm dishes were not selected this time as my friends were not accustomed to Szechuan cuisine, and they needed to be broken in slowly.

I first ordered the country fried steak with the gravy on the side and did not like it but then I ordered the corn beef hash meal and it was delicious. They replaced my meal with no problem at all. My date got the cowboy skillet and it was delicious. They did his eggs over easy instead of scrambled like it normally comes. Prices were decent for the sizes of meals. Service was excellent kept making sure everything was okay and we didn't need anything. Definitely would come back.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I pass Art's at least 2x a day, and we FINALLY stopped in on Sunday. There was a 20 minute wait but we didn't mind. Once we were seated, our waitress was super kind and personable and recommended her fave breakfast dishes.   There are TONS of options on the menu. I'm almost positive there is something for everyone. I started off with coffee and then ordered the bohemian skillet. It had ham, cheese, potatoes, spinach and mushrooms with scrambled eggs on top. The coffee was average diner coffee, nothing to rave about, but I didn't go for the coffee so that's okay. The skillet was good...but it was definitely something I could've made at home. The mushrooms served in my skillet were straight from the can and the potato's had no seasoning on them.   Nothing was inedible or even nasty. Everything was good and we were satisfied with the customer service. It just wasn't as bomb as everyone makes it seems in my opinion.

"We booked an appointment as a Christmas gift for my parents (who've never been to an ultrasound before). The technician was very friendly and took her time with us. The baby wasn't cooperating and kept covering their face, so she worked the whole time to get us a good view and she finally did! We were appreciative that she didn't give up.   The setting was very comfortable- nice bed for mom-to-be to lie on and a large leather sectional couch with a projector view on the wall for the guests. The lights were dimmed and very welcoming.   We received several photos (including a few for the grandparents, which was a nice surprise!). And we got to see baby's face, legs, hands and feet. We also heard the heartbeat and could see the gender.   Booking online was easy and convenient. They have several options based on your trimester. You pay a portion of the fee up front to hold your spot and then you get a reminder text/email before your appointment. We paid the balance at the end of our visit. It was all very smooth.   We'll be booking another appointment in the next trimester so the other grandma can have a viewing as well, and so we can see the baby with a little more fat :) we were told we get a discount on the second appointment so that's exciting too. Can't wait for a return visit!  (We didn't take any photos on our first visit because we were too excited. I'll add some after our second appointment.)",Business Category: Health & Medical,Review Stars: 5.0
"Look out Tucson, Sullivan's is back!!!  When Sullivan's underwent new ownership, the game changed.   The new GM, Joe Romanosky, not only has returned to his family roots back in Arizona, but brought members from his thriving Sullivan's - Charlotte, NC location with him.   Joe is shaking things up and has begun to bring Sullivan's back to the forefront of people's minds for fine dining.  Sullivan's has retained some of the best of the best personnel including Sarah and Hunter.  This past weekend, I celebrated my birthday with my husband. Little did I know that my husband had called Joe and arranged an evening to remember.  As I walked through the front door, Sarah had the BIGGEST smile on her face, and genuinely reflected warmth as she escorted us to our table. To my surprise and delight, we were situated at the prime (no pun intended) table. Booth, back of the room, directly facing the open kitchen on the opposing wall.  Rose petals were strewn randomly across the pristine white tablecloth! Oh my goodness.....  Moments after sitting, Joe came over and warmly welcomed us 'home'. While catching up, Hunter arrived and greeted us with an expansive wine list, supper options, and begun pouring Peligrino.  Our appetizers consisted of champagne, shrimp cocktail, oysters from the East and West Coast, and a French loaf of warmed bread and butter. Our meal included Bone-in Tomahawk aged rib steaks, creamed spinach, asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes. Dessert consisted of a chocolate mound. To die for! The presentation from Hunter was truly spectacular when he poured hot fudge over the dome so it would collapse inward to reveal a chocolate lover's delight.  During our supper, Sarah came and took our photograph. Little did we know that at the end of our meal, we were presented our photo in a black frame with signatures from all.   The service was impeccable. We were never without. We chose to dine slowly, relish in the rich decor, lively atmosphere, and truly marvel over our experience.

"The experience was very underwhelming for me.  I saw it open in the Moorestown Mall a while ago and was glad to finally get to try it.  Unfortunately I will not choose to go back.  We got there early for dinner, at 5:30pm, so there were lots of open tables.  The host seated us in a corner near where the extra servers tend to hang out, so we could overhear them talking about how bored they were.  There was confusion on who our server would be, so that added idle time to our wait.  The salad was way over-dressed to my taste.  The bread was good, I'll agree with the many others who gave compliments to that.  My bolognese sauce was thin and watery, with puddles that seeped through the noodles.  My wife's shrimp were over-cooked, hard, and rubbery.  If I didn't know better, I would have guessed that our meals were cooked in a microwave in the back.  Our waitress never asked how the food was or if we enjoyed our meal.  She did ask if we would want to take our un-eaten portions home with us, but honestly it wasn't worth carrying back to the car.

They did serve us very quickly so if you want a quick, delicious burger and don't mind spending extra for more flavor and less grease than a fast food place, Smashburger fits the bill.

"Went here with another couple for dinner...menu looked interesting and not driving into the city was appealing.    Nice decor although the acoustics are not great.  It's loud; not a place to bring Grandma.  On the flip side, since my kids were home with the sitter, I was grateful for the noise since I noticed a couple with a baby in tow.  At 8 pm.  I digress...  The menu on the web is not the same as in the restaurant, but there were still many choices - or tap-ahs - as our waitress called them.  This was the least of her problems butchering the English language.    We had the olives (good),  Kobe beef cup appetizer (very good) and the cheese plate.  Our waitress kept calling it ""manchango"" cheese, but the kicker was the runner who delivered the plate and told us one of the cheeses was called ""fromage.""  I might not speak French, but seriously...  It was a very nice plate, but the portions were so small that each of us had one nibble and it was gone.  Two thin slices of apple?  Really?  Half of a small strawberry?  Why bother?  The ""main course"" tap-ahs we shared were anywhere from ok to good.  The rabbit was quite tasty, as was the lamb fritatta.  The duck was okay and the shrimp/scallop diablo had been made by someone who didn't know that ""diablo"" means it should be spicy.  It was very bland.  Our friends had the white sangria; I thought it was mediocre at best.  My husband and I tried a tequila flight - good flavors, although our server could not offer any insight into why we might like one flight over another.   Good company, but disappointing meal.

"I went there last night for the first time after reading an article listing Sbraga as one of the top 10 restaurants in Philadelphia in 2015.  While the host was very kind, our server oozed in snobbery and condescension.  After seating us and providing us menus, I asked a question about one of the dishes listed, the waiter curtly replied, ""I will tell you about the menu after I bring your beverages.""   It was a snowy, Tuesday evening, so the restaurant was virtually empty - when we asked to order alla carte off of the menu which is meant to be prix fixe, the waiter instructed us that we would have to eat at the bar.  Quizzically looking around at the empty restaurant, we weren't sure whether to simply leave or go to the bar.  Ultimately, we decided to go to the bar.  On our way there, the host stopped us and asked what we were doing - when we explained, he ushered us right back to our table.  Thereafter, the same waiter worked our table and was downright condescending and rude.  It was really unexpected for a restaurant of this supposed caliber.  The salad had 3-4 leaves of bibb lettuce and the main entree was minuscule - even all carte, at those prices, there should at least be some substance to the plates other than presentation.

Jen is very, very talented.  She coaxed my reverse mullet (it was an accident!) into something totally different and flattering to my face.  I have thick, coarse, straight hair that can be difficult to cut and style- I don't blame stylists when I end up with a bad haircut, because it happens so often.  But Jen knows what she's doing- I've had many compliments on my hair after she styled it, which never has happened before.  In addition to being a great stylist, her bubbly personality makes the visit all the more fun.  She gives great recommendations on everything from styling tips to restaurants.  House Productions offers free bang trims in between haircuts, so you never have to cut your own hair (not that I ever would, of course.  Ahem).

"I kind of feel horrible for giving 1601 this rating because I am an accidental regular there, but I don't know. I can't really explain why I'm giving them 3 stars because I've never had a bad experience there before. Ideally I'd give them a 3.75, but we all know that's impossible on here ;]  Anyway, 1601 gets a lot of bad press from you Yelpers, which is a shame because it really is a lovely place. It's cozy, and half of it is intimate. The pool table in the backroom sticks out like a sore thumb but hey, if it brings in business then go for it. They also have outdoor seating, which is nice when it's not super humid and oven-esque outside. I really like the decor inside, though. It's simple but it works.   The beer list leaves something to be desired. Like any restaurant in Philadelphia, they do have microbrews on draft. The only thing that bothers me somewhat is that they really don't rotate very frequently (of course, that could be because I'm there like once a week but still.), and sometimes the pour to price ratio seems off. The bottle list is small, but does have something for everyone. Their happy hour isn't terrible ($1 off drafts and $3 Stoli cocktails), but compared to the other bars in the neighborhood it needs to step up a bit.   I also really like the food. I was really surprised because for some reason I thought I wouldn't, but everything I've had there has been awesome. The scallop appetizer particularly stands out, as they weren't over-cooked at all. Also, their frites with the horseradish dipping sauce are decadent. I lovelovelove them.   I think the service is good here as well, although if you're sitting outside then you may have to go to the bar yourself to get your drinks. Sometimes the bartender doesn't always make it there. I've never had a problem there, but I am also a regular so I kind of have that advantage in that they know me.   I don't know. I enjoy going there because the POPE and I have broken up recently, but had my boyfriend not been a regular there then I probably wouldn't have started frequenting this place.

"Summary: seamless experience, no issues or concerns, fair pricing, safe and reliable transport, would absolutely use again and highly recommend   I could not have been more pleased¬†and impressed by my experience with Happy Tails to get my new puppy from her breeder into my arms. I live in New York City but my breeder lives in Kentucky. Because of the many travel restrictions due to COVID, there were no non-stop flights between us, and I did not feel comfortable putting the pup on a connecting¬†flight. When I started looking into ground transportation, my first stop was to look through the directory on International Pet and Animal Transportation Association (IPATA). My vet made it clear that the most legitimate and safest companies would be listed there. I reached out to a handful of companies, and Happy Tails not only got back to me first, but they did so with a clear price and detailed policies as well as flexibility on timing. They also reassured me that all COVID-related precautions would be taken with the transportation. Elaine at Happy Tails was indispensable¬†as she worked tirelessly to arrange the transport within less than a week from when I first contacted the company. I was so grateful! As soon as the driver, Marko, was assigned, the communication was perfectly coordinated between everyone (Elaine, Marko, the breeder, me). Marko called two days before the trip to tell me his planned route and discuss things like feeding and potty breaks. Elaine called me the night before to answer any lingering questions. I felt tremendously well taken care of the entire time, and the absolute same was true for my pup. Throughout her drive from KY to NY, I received frequent updates (including GPS location and pictures) from Marko, and the pup arrived fed, pottied, and in good spirits! I did not think such a long ground journey on such short notice would be possible, let alone such a seamless and safe experience. I would absolutely use Happy Tails again -- without any hesitation!

"Just two minutes from my place is a pretty cool spot which does breakfast and lunch, closing at three p.m. I've not had the breakfast but from the looks of the menu it seems quite tasty.  Portobello prides itself on home-cooked food and when my friend and I went in for lunch, we saw the Specials board touting Chicken/Bacon wraps for $6.95. We ordered this and my friend got the house wine (more on this in a minute) Delicious, moist morsels of chicken marinated in a spicy sauce with real bacon bits incorporated inside a soft flour wrap, drizzled with a home-made Ranch sauce. The sides of cole slaw and potato salad were superb! I have to give a nod to the potato salad, slightly sweet with parts of the skin..best stuff I've had in a while. As for the house wine. I noticed my friend hadn't hardly touched her white Chardonnay. She confided it was 'off' or 'old'. When the waitress came over, she told her and the waitress said it was 'home-made'. This is when I tasted it and I recoiled like I had a shot of Moonshine. The flavor was so overwhelmingly redolent of alcohol I thought of Retsina or Ouzo. I mean, this stuff could have been added to a car's gas tank and the car would have gotten real good mileage. I could have stripped old paint off with a bit of this. Damn! So the waitress took this off our bill but actually charged us $7.95 for the lunch specials. We showed her the mistake and she was apologetic about the mistake. So, I didn't add a fifth star to our lunch adventure at Portobellos but I'm anxious to come back and try breakfast. And they should seriously consider marketing the 'home-made' wine as something else but they don't have a liquor license!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Does anyone know what happened to this place? When it went from a true non-profit to a 'for-profit' things went downhill fast. I want to know where all the vintage and antique items went. I remember buying a $2,000 dollar gesso mirror from around 1890 for $38 dollars from here. The antique bargains were insane. I even found an 1880's Ansonia spelter clock topper from here once that I paid $8 for. This was the most incredible place around for people with little or no money, but wanted to collect antique/vintage stuff. Do they sell the antique donations before they send the rest to the stores?

They have a good selection of your typical bar food, all of which is great. The chicken fingers are especially top-notch. They have some really great basic sushi rolls, like the spicy tuna which is my fave, but they make some really yummy specialty rolls as well. Everything I've had has been excellent, except some grouper roll that I don't remember the name of.   The staff is pretty much always nice and do their best to be quick, even when its crowded.

"Tried this place on our recent trip to NOLA. So freaking good! We went back a second time.   The first time I went it was for breakfast and I ordered the eggs Benedict with crab and shrimp cake. Great creole flavor, a hint of spice and lots of flavor with a side of jambalaya.  The next day was for lunch and I had the crispy chicken melt. That flavor was so multi layered, sweet, spicy, creole....so good. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and breaded. Then the cole slaw had some jalape√±os for spice and the jelly on the bread was sweet and spicy.   Overall I'd recommend this place to anyone. The staff was friendly and attentive and the food quality was so great for the price. A must go to",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Disclaimer- this is the first sushi restaurant we've tried in the area, we didn't try hibachi yet   With that being said, the sushi didn't disappoint. Sushi and hibachi are on opposite sides of the restaurant which is nice if you want a quiet evening you don't hear much of the noise from the hibachi side. Now for the food- my favorite is the mushroom soup. They have the classic Japanese restaurant salad with ginger dressing. I always get philadelipa rolls and tuna rolls, Philly rolls come with 8 pieces and the tuna came with 6. I think that's a fair amount for the price they charge. The spicy mayo is delish and they didn't charge extra for it. On this trip they gave us free vanilla ice cream- nice touch.   We will certainly be back here again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Ate there last night.   Found this place on yelp. It's a few miles off I-64 but worth the drive. We were going to eat at a steakhouse, but there was a 45 minute wait and we were hungry.   What a great alternative! Thanks yelp and yelp directions! If you can,  make a reservation, we were lucky and they were able to get us a table without one.   We couldn't decide what to eat so I had the schnitzel sampler and my husband had the roast sampler. So much food so little time. We shared both platters. My husband was happy because they had Spaten Optimater on tap.  Recipes for the food were handed down from great grandma originally from Germany.

First room the AC didn't work. Second room was infested with some biting insects. We spent two miserable hours and an $89.00 room ended up costing us a $100.00. I would not recommend staying at this flea hotel or New Orleans for that matter. They seem to be trying to support their budget deficit on the backs of tourists with their outrageous taxes and fees. Which cost more than the services you are renting or buying.   This hotel does not deserve a single star. I gave the minimum so that I could write this review.

Would not buy from again. But I did finally receive my shirts after 5-6 weeks. Tried contacting company on the status of my order but no one actually responds all I got was an automated message. A second automated message came the day after explaining how some items were on back order. It included a spreadsheet to look up the item you ordered and gave a date on when it was tentatively scheduled to ship. 2 weeks after I purchased the shirts I received an email with a tracking number but they just create the shipping label without actually shipping the item. After a month I created a dispute with PayPal and only then did the item actually ship out. Not the best first impression. Probably won't order from here again.,Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 2.0
"I have to admit, that when the cab dropped us off at The Patterson House, I got a little scared.  As the cab driver was running our card, a clearly intoxicated sorority girl with smudged makeup and glassy eyes jumped into the front seat and slurred at the driver, ""Finally! I just need to go around the corner."" The cabby calmly told the girl that he still had passengers and to please wait outside. Since that didn't really register with her, I asked if she (and her tiny gal pals that were waiting outside) had come from Patterson House. ""Yeahh! It's awwwesomme. Get the vodka thingy. The vodka cranberry? No the one with grapefruit. Grapefruit vodkaaaa. Yeahhh! It's sooo good. Can y'all get out so that my friends can get in?""  Great. A college kid hangout that serves ""vodka thingies"". I might be in my twenties, but I don't do frat-tastic. I'm way, way too old for that sh*t.  Boy, am I glad that we got past the cab incident! When we settled into the bar, a bartender immediately greeted us. I wish I remembered her name-- she was fantastic. We told her everything looked great-- we're adventurous. Just go for it. We each got a couple of off-menu drinks that featured drink-specific ice cubes and several different types of house-made bitters (that Japanese spherical ice mold separates the men from the boys, in my opinion). A blood-orange concoction, a ginger-lemon and orange drink, a riff on a negroni, and an absinthe number.   We also partook in a few of the decadent bar snacks available. They also did not disappoint. It was mostly a collection of high-brow versions of low-brow foods. Fried goat cheese balls with a red pepper coulis, cinnamon-sugar doughnut holes, lamb sliders.  Also, when a group of loud, fratty guys (yes, I know that I am like an old woman) invited their friend to stand next to them (i.e. all up in my business and ear), she told him that standing wasn't allowed and that they'd have to find a seat.

"I've been an infrequent visitor of this white tabled Chinese restaurant for a long time.  For me, the food has always been good, service nice, and it has a little different feel than the other places I frequent on a more regular basis.  Plus, I love that this place hasn't changed a bit as the Brentwood area has puffed out around them.  I stopped in last night for a quick bite of potstickers.  They were very good and I was pleased that they are stuffed full with meat.  For some reason they had the aroma of pancakes... but it didn't detract from the taste.  I also wanted to get a drink but due to communication issues with the server, I settled for the pre-provided hot tea.    If you're wondering where to park, there is a very small lot to the south of the business.  It's sometimes easier finding this lot via the back alley rather than slowing to a crawl while traveling on Brentwood.  There's construction right now on the front of the building.  It's been that way for a while.  I hope they get it fixed soon because the boarded up look is an eye sore.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"HANDS down the best Sushi in the area. I have friends that drive in from Philly just to eat here. I have been eating here for years and have never had anything short of a fantastic experience. As another reviewer pointed out , the Chef's specialty rolls are really great. My favorites are the Bob Roll and the Twin Spicy Roll. The Chef truly has a way with actual sushi. Something about the way he cuts his fish combined with his perfect rice makes me wildly happy. The fish and seafood are always at the perfect temperature, which is crucial in my opinion. Sengyo is also really affordable, and the prices do not reflect the quality of food they turn out. Truly a south jersey gem, and a mom and pop place taboot.

"We enjoyed a very nice lunch this past Saturday ordering food off both the authentic and Americanized menus. We ordered hot and sour soup, shredded potato in chili oil, cold sesame noodles, Taiwanese sausage and scallion pancake to start, then ordered Dan Dan Noodles, Generals Tso's Chicken and Chicken with Hot Dry Peppers as our meals... in case you are wondering, yes that is a lot of food, but everything sounded so yummy and we had a hard time deciding. The food and portions were excellent. Great service, the wait staff was friendly and attentive. The location is hard to find, I put the address into the navi and it took us to a plaza on the other side of the red light. We drove around a bit til we found it, it is in the Exton Plaza so when you see that, stop and go in, there is a big produce market in the plaza and as previous posters have mentioned it's beside the dollar store.   There was a lot of sliced garlic in every dish, I loved it but if you aren't a fan be warned. The hot and sour soup needed some vinegar which the waiter was more than happy to bring to me, it was good once I gave it a spoonful. My General Tso's Chicken which I ordered spicy wasn't very spicy, however the Chicken with Hot Dry Peppers was VERY spicy and a wonderful surprise. I didn't have any sausage or dan dan noodles (I'm not that adventurous) but my friends enjoyed them so I do believe they were a hit. The cold sesame noodles were great, I'd suggest mixing in the peanut sauce once they get to the table, it was gooped on top and to me was a bit over whelming but was great when mixed in with the noodles evenly.  Scallion pancakes were good, so was the potato in chili oil.  We will most definately go back there is so much more we wanted to try.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

You know when you're not super hungry but you find some food that makes you want to keep eating? That was the problem me and my fiance ran into tonight. The place was pretty slow when we got there but picked up as we got into our meal. The service was prompt and the man whom I assume was the owner was attentive and respectful.  When we looked at the menu there were a few thing that were familiar but we opted for the unknown and were not disappointed. I wish I could tell you what we had but everything on both plates was excellent and filling. I found myself complaining that I wasn't more hungry because I wanted to savor every bite.  This has been on our list for a while and will probably become a regular spot for future meals.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"This place's highlight is the food. I had the Cuban sandwich which had BBQ pork and it was smoky, tender, and yummy! It was also very big and I had to take the second half home.   I also had some buffalo wings which were okay, not terrible but not great. Not something worth trying in my opinion.   The curly fries (and the regular fries), had a crunch to them which was good because wimpy fries are lame.   Our waitress was attentive and refilled our drinks when necessary... and it wasn't crowded for a Wednesday lunch time.   FYI, they have BBQ brisket on Wednesdays but it goes fast!

Large with ham and pineapple.  It was ready when I got there and the woman at the counter was as sweet as could be.  $17 and I was out the door.  It was ok.  The toppings were a little weak and the ham was sparse, almost like the accountant was the one making the pizza's.  It was definitely a little wet/soggy/oven could've been hotter.

"Went to Bertucci's because all the other restaurants I went to had a 2+ hour wait....no wait here at all. Should have taken it as a sign.   The service we had was awful, we asked to be seated in the bar because my boyfriend wanted to watch the college games. There were a few other people at the bar, but we were the only table. Our waitress started out fine, bringing us bread and oil (which IMO was disgusting, it left a bad taste in my mouth) but then when we wanted to order, she wasn't around, then it took a long time to get out food. By this time the other people at the bar had left, and we were the only people other then the bartender at the bar.   We probably had to wait about 20 minutes from the time we finished eating until the waitress came back, and we didn't see her at all while we were eating. The bartender meanwhile starting cleaning the bar, taking out trash and everything while we were there, making me feel like we were being rushed out. There were other staff hanging out in the bar area after their shift, plus the bartender, who saw us sitting there basically twittling our thumbs, and none of them took the initiative to find our waitress for us. I probably won't be back because of the poor service, the only reason I gave it 2 stars was for the food, which was pretty good, but EXTREMELY OVERPRICED.

"There are two tipping points that enabled me to bless the suburb of poboys w/ a Four Star rating.  Note: this review is based on three poboys in 2012 (even though I have eaten here several times in my youth, which is my pre-yelp days).  1. Hot Sausage -- This is probably them most average hot sausage pattie poboy I ever had in the south. There is definitely spice but the overall flavor and hotness, both in temperature and flavor, was very par. Not bad but no yowzer factor. PAR.  2. Roast beef -- Do note that I am not a fan of this sandwich b.c like everywhere else, it is a sloppy and flavor-needing sandwich that never inundate my taste buds. PAR.  3. Catfish -- Simply put, Impressive. Definitely a five-r right here despite my transgressions. Why? Their bread is tough. I very much dislike tough bread on any poboy (here and around the city) with the exception of the Roast beef b/c that thing is bleeding gravy. But generally speaking, tough bread means frownie face for the joint. Secondly, the batter for the fish didn't have a nice crunch to it, but despite that, the egg wash batter coupled with the freshness and softness of the fish made for a most delectable combo that if hobbit elves could dance on my taste buds, the Short Stop catfish achieved its goal.   Overall, despite the weakness of the bread, semi-soggy crinkle cut sweet potato fries (which I didn't mention), and a weak hot sausage pattie poboy, the FACT that for the size of its poboys w/ its price point AND the catfish being that divine, I had to give Short Stop a round house kick it to a Four.   Point? Definitely not the best poboy in town but for the price and for the fish, it grazed the threshold of ""I'm a fan."" Four-banger.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

It wasn't very flavorful and the cilantro dressing was very watery. I may come back to try something else on the menu, but overall I wasn't too impressed.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Went in to buy a replacement cartridge for my Sodastream.  Found that as well as some soda refills.  Whenever I've gone here in the past, for everything from spatulas to bed linen, I've found what I wanted.  Made in America?  Depends on the product.  Colanders?  Found one made here.   I've been 50/50 trying to make it around the aisle displays without succumbing to something I didn't expect to buy, but what the heck. Checkout?   Hectic.  What I can't figure out is that there always seems to be twice as many people buying things at the registers then there are in the rest of the store.  Where did they come from? Parking?  My antennas are always up.  It's a shared parking lot with a pet store, a fresh market, a number of small take out shops, a music store, etc.   and there are only three exits, two onto Fletcher and one onto Dale Mabry.  People flying along in their cars in the parking lot trying to be the next one out onto the roads.  Be careful.",Business Category: Shopping,Review Stars: 3.0
Abe's is what Mug's and Jug's used to be.  Seems like they even kept the menu the same.  I ordered what I usually used to order when it was the previous restaurant.  I was a little disappointed with the amount of food I was given.  The amount of fries felt like it was a side order of fries not a side on the entree.  The service was pretty average.  If you are in the mood for some average bar food then yes this is a place to visit.  I did order the boneless wings with garlic parm sauce.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Came here for a late night dinner and food was alright. Nice music, food, hookah, etc.    Got 4 very thin lamb chops that were charbroiled and had decent flavor. Regular basic white rice, small salad and a very dried out pita bread. Portions were good and filling but overall food wasn't the greatest Mediterranean food I've had. With all the great reviews I was definitely expecting more flavor. No hummus or garlic sauce either with the food. Which was a little strange as other place do give you even a small side to mix with the food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Really cute place. The food is good but like most places they are short staffed. I often think I should sit at the bar for better service. The waiter made up for the slow service by giving us a round of drinks for free. The meatball app was really and chicken Milanese and parm were delicious.

"Truly enjoyed dining at The Love. We sat on the 2nd floor, which is much quieter than the 1st. They usually only host large parties there but they open it up on busy nights. A very classic and historical feel with the wood/ wicker chairs and candlelight. Their cocktails are aptly named - I got the very good bourbon drink. We shared a few of the small plates. The fig Caesar was absolutely amazing, best croutons I've ever had. We also got the tube poke which was interesting but not the best I've ever had. The sauce the scallops came in, I could've lapped it up like soup! My dinner partner says their sazarac is amazing, tastes just like one from New Orleans.

"This is literally ""Woohoo! As good as it gets"" for Tucson football stadiums. What can you really say on yelp about a stadium since they kinda monopolize whatever it is they're doing? Are you NOT going to go to the game here because the Cardinals play in a state of the art stadium in Glendale? For that matter, what do other college stadiums look like? ASU plays in a dump. Cal? Dump. USC? Are you kidding? You got one choice in Tucson for watching the Wildcats and this is it.  Now, it may seem like I'm doing an awful lot of apologizing so let's get to the nitty gritty. I have been going to Arizona Stadium for DECADES. If you can sit in the student section (aka ""ZONA ZOO"") that is as good as it gets. It's a real student section in a PAC-12, major conference stadium. It's loud, rowdy, exactly what you want your collegiate athletic experience to be.  Now, at my advanced age, I sit in the nosebleds and it's good. Sunsets are gorgeous and you get a great view of the entire field as well as the city and surrounding mountains. As for the game, any distance issues are solved by virtue of the GIGANTIC FREAKIN' VIDEO SCREEN. Wow, that thing is HD, super high resolution!  Bathrooms: They exist, they are clean, they have kid height urinals, I didn't have to wait in line.  Food: They have some, but bring your cash since plastic is not accepted at all locations.  Parking: It kinda sucks but they make it work - the stadium is on-campus after all! Also, you can pay someone in the neighborhood nearby to park in their front yard. It works, get over it, would you rather pay $35?  BEAR DOWN ARIZONA!",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 5.0

"Would have been a great dinner, if not for the service! We were there Saturday, had reservations for four at 8pm. We were sat at a dirty table, wine stains and crumbs all over the table cloth. It took them 10 minutes to stop by and fix it. Then our waiter had to be asked 3 times to open our bottles of wine (pretty important for a BYO I'd say) and forgot my Dad's soda twice. Food was excellent and priced well - the calamari appetizer was delicious and tender, as was the veal. House made pastas were sticky and stuck in large clumps though. It took 25 minutes, after asking, to get our check. We were sat for over 2 and a half hours because of how poor the service was. Not worth coming back to, since there are other great BYOs in the city that can handle  some volume on a Saturday night.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"My parents rate Thai Food on verbs. Such as Slow Thai (service is slow), Fast Thai ( you get your food sometimes before you drinks), Good Thai (exceptional food and service) and Bad Thai ( you get the picture).  Thai Basil falls into the Good Thai, staff was friendly, informative, and gave my wife recommendations on a few choices because she could not make up her mind.    The food was outstanding, I had the Thai Basil Fried Rice. AWESOME. I had it with beef, it was a perfect dish, just the right amount of heat to enhance an already good tasting meal. My wife Thai Curry Green Chicken, she enjoyed it, right about of flavor not over powering by any means.    Thai Basil is very solid Thai Joint, I dont think you will be disappointed, Unless your just a picky and difficult person, if that's the case, don't eat ethnic food :)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I was hesitant to try Bayona as the menu was small. However, the concierge at our hotel recommended that it is a great dining experience with food picked fresh daily.   The restaurant is extremely cute with a courtyard in the back and a warm southern charm inside. The only negative is it gets a little cold with the air.   The waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the food and wine list. Her recommendations were on point and she was very accommodating about my boyfriends nut allergy.   The food was amazing and definitely tops my list of best restaurants. The food was superb from appetizer to dessert. We got the following: -appetizers   -shrimp and black bean   -cippolini with Monterey cheese and onions   -goat cheese crouton    - sweet potato brioche with maple butter- had it come with the entrees and was warm, light, sweet and salty. Perfect combo   -entree   -pepper crusted lamb- so good and I'm not a lamb person. Cooked perfectly and tender   - flat iron steak - cooked perfectly, tender and flavorful  Desserts   -cherry sorbet-AMAZING. My favorite of the two   -chocolate tart- good but enjoyed the espresso ice cream more than the tart.    Must try on your trip to New Orleans! Will definitely be back !",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
Food is bland. Pho did not have much flavor and a small barely has any meat or noodles. Stir fry looks good online but when we got it the taste was gross and not good to eat. Just a few bites and waste the whole thing. Egg rolls was pretty good tho def had a nice crisp to it but fish sauce was also very bland. Spring roll didn't taste fresh and you can tell by the wrap that it probably was sitting before serving it to us. Peanut sauce is bland too. Service wasn't bad but they were kinda slow with our table but food came out quick,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Went to get shellac gel manicure here, less than 24 hours later they're already falling off! I woke up with four nails missing. Usually, this type of manicure lasts for 2 weeks! I wasn't doing anything other than my usual day to day routine, so there's no reason for this to be happening other than a poorly done manicure. I regret leaving such a nice tip. Instead of having a drying UV table for nails or shellac, they use outdated small DIY table light that they plug in that gets so hot its uncomfortable. The table UV light does NOT work! The woman kept having to plug it in, unplug it, and shake the device in order for it to turn on!! If they don't have the proper tools to do a gel manicure, they should not be charging for them!  The lighting in the facility was terrible, I didn't realize until I got to the car that two of my nails were smudged so I had to go back in to fix it (this is before they all fell off). The ""salon"" looks like a big converted warehouse, it's crowded, hectic, and doesn't flow nicely with Zero ambiance.There are a Ton of nail salons in the area that are much better than this one- Never going back!!!

I thought the layout was spacious and kept it from feeling overly crowded.  The live DJs were fun and the food trucks were essential!  I devoured a giant soft pretzel and some pepperoni pizza from local food trucks.  I also made several stops at the Just Pop In tent for the goose the market and Carmel corn popcorn samplings.  There were several interactive components to the festival including making your own pretzel necklace as well as bean bag toss and giant beer pong.  The lines were relatively short the entire afternoon which was nice.  Hats off to the coordinators of the event-- well planned!",Business Category: Arts & Entertainment,Review Stars: 5.0
"This place just wasn't my favorite. I think it just caters to the baby boomers that live in the immediate area. My cocktails were watery and the menu was not particularly creative - not that there is anything wrong with classic if prepared properly. Nothing I ordered stood out as particularly good, and fried appetizers are not what I would expect from a place with these price-points. Overall, I felt it wasn't worth it when there are better preparations and creative menus so many other places in Indy.  We went on a Sunday night and there were only a few other tables filled; mostly older couples.  Side-note: I could see that the lodge-feel of the place would make a great space to rent out for nice parties or even small weddings.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"When we're craving a light meal of an appetizer and salad, we always go to Firebirds. We've enjoyed entrees there as well, but this is our go-to for a light, shareable meal with cocktails in the bar area. Hubby absolutely adores the jalapeno deviled eggs with housemade candied bacon and we both enjoy their classic spinach salad with applewood-smoked bacon, mushrooms, tomatoes, egg, and balsamic vinaigrette. On our latest visit, we chose to add seared ahi tuna to our salad for an additional $8.85. When you're sharing a delicious salad, the total price tag of $19.80 isn't so bad, right? ;) We sat at a high top table next to the fireplace instead of directly at the bar. It had just started to rain as we entered Firebirds so the warmth of the fireplace made us forget about the cool dampness -- the cocktails helped us forget, too!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"I usually don't write reviews but I am truly disappointed in this dining experience. After sitting for 15 minutes and not being greeted our waiter actually turned out to be awesome. However, all of the staff made it clear there was a new chef and they were not happy with him. Dining at an Italian restaurant we wanted pasta, however we were told the new chef has very small portions and if we wanted to leave full, not to get pasta. The waiter recommended the scallops and the duck. Unfortunately both were awful. Also we ordered the buffalo mozzarella appetizer and the bread was burnt.   The only good was the waiter was kind of enough to take off the duck and add a glass of wine which we made up for with a tip. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

Although there was good snacks and coffee I will never return as the staff who took our orders were the rudest people I have ever met. We ordered coffees and they corrected us on our terminology on cup SIZING and rolled their eyes throughout our short time ordering like they were completely put out by us. They told us to sit and they'd bring our drinks to us when they were ready and we waited a good 10 minutes with no drinks.

"Places this great will almost always have a wait, so... Important TIP: download the free 'nowait' (no wait) app and you can put yourself in line before you head down and save yourself the wait!   WOW - The Ruby Slipper totally knocked our socks off! I am always hesitant to try a place that has multiple locations over a place that stands all on its own, but this place absolutely smashed that rule.   The first thing that really impressed me about the Ruby Slipper was how genuine and friendly the staff all seemed to be. They all were very busy but completely hustling to take care of people. It was sort of a team effort; multiple servers topped off our coffee & water, cleared plates, etc. I think it says a LOT about a hospitality crew when they all work together like that!   Next up: the beverages. When in NOLA... Well let's just say they go all out with their bloody Mary's. We're talking whole huge strips of bacon, large pieces of lemon and lime, whole veggies pieces... It's like a salad in a boozy, tomato-y cup. Also, the coffee was darn impressive for diner coffee!   We had the salmon benedict breakfast and the country breakfast. Both were outstanding. And the biscuits.... Ugh, the biscuits. They have absolutely ruined all other biscuits for me. They were just the perfect amount of dense, yet fluffy. Flaky, yet moist. Buttery, but not at all greasy. Just off the charts great biscuits. The grits were super tasty as well with good corn flavor, and not too mushy or sticky. My eggs were cooked exactly how I ordered them, which almost never happens because I have an oddly specific order that most chefs just can't or won't do: 'over hard, fried, dead, browned, solid, cooked all the way through'. Sorry, but that's how I like them! The ruby slipper nailed it. I finished my eggs for the first time in I can't remember how long. Yay! The salmon benedict was just bursting with meaty chunks of smoked-in-house salmon. Really, really nicely done.   Lastly - for this incredible breakfast experience, the price was very reasonable! About $30 all in for the two of us.   I absolutely will go back any time I'm in NOLA and can't recommend this place highly enough!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
